OKAY
DOES ANYONE WANT TO SEE UH STEVE'S FEEDBACK FROM THE SPECIFICATION
RIGHT
NOT REALLY UM JUST WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT LIKE DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND
LIKE DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND STUFF AND UM YEAH
HE WAS SAYING THAT WE SHOULD MAYBE UH THINK ABOUT HAVING A PROTOTYPE FOR WEEK SIX WHICH IS NEXT WEEK
YEAH
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY PRIORITIZE OUR PACKAGES
MM
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
HAS HAS ANYONE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE JAVA CODE FOR THE HUH
HMM
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH I I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY THAT MIGHT BE ONLINE
DEPENDS HOW IT'S GONNA WORK
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
HMM
HMM
YEAH YOU JUST CONCATENATE THEM TOGETHER
HMM
YEAH
IT JUST MEANS IT LOADS ON DEMAND
IT ONLY LOADS WHEN IT NEEDS A PARTICULAR TYPE OF FILE
LIKE WHEN IT'S BEING ACCESSED
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE IDEA IT JUST LOADS THE PARTICULAR ONES IT NEEDS
BUT IF YOU WERE DOING A SEARCH OVER THE WHOLE CORPUS YOU'D HAVE TO LOAD THEM ALL
HMM
MM
HMM
YEAH WE DO NOT WANT IT IN TO DEVELOP A LITTLE TREE DISPLAY AS WELL FOR MULTIPLE RESULTS
YEAH BUT THAT'D BE QUITE EASY TO DO
YOU JUST NEED TO FIND THE TIME STAMP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK I THINK THOSE SEGMENTS FOR EACH UTTERANCE ARE SPLIT UP
THINK SO
YEAH I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S ALREADY THERE
PRETTY SURE THAT'S ALREADY THERE
THE THE UTTERANCES ARE NUMBERED
HMM
YEAH I THINK SO
YE THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GET YEAH
OH
HMM
YE
MM
YEAH UH
RIGHT
OKAY
TOPICS YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT ONE
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
MM
HMM
YEAH THAT'D BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO DO THAT
YEAH
HMM
HMM
YEAH YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT IN JAVA YEAH
YEAH
HUH
HMM
YEAH I'VE HAD A B I'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE THE TOPIC SEGMENTS HOW IT'S STORED
AND THEN YEAH TH THOSE ARE FEW PER MEETING AND IT UM WELL
IT GIVES A TIME STAMP AND INSIDE EACH ONE THERE'S UH THE ACTUAL LIKE UTTERANCE SEGMENTS
AND THE LIST OF THEM THAT OCCURRED
AND THEY'RE ALL NUMBERED
UM SO THAT'S WHERE THAT'S STORED
YEAH
SO I GUESS UM IF I'M GONNA BE SEGMENTING IT WITH A L. C. SEG THEN THAT'S LIKE SAME FORMAT I'D WANT TO UM PUT IT BACK OUT IN SO IT'D BE EQUIVALENT
WELL LIKE THE INTEGRATION
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INTEGRATION
HMM
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S BEEN ALLOCATED TO DO THAT YET
YEAH YEAH
YEAH DEFINITELY
HMM YEAH
YEAH IT C COULD BE DIFFICULT YEAH
YEAH
WELL I GUESS THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET THE CRUCIAL M MODULES BUILT
YE YEAH
YEAH AND THEN
YEAH AND THEN WE'LL MAYBE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE SOMEBODY INTO JUST INTEGRATING IT
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK SO
UH YEAH
HMM
YEAH YEAH
JASMINE I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU'D UH LOOKED AT EXTRACTING THE TEXT
YEAH
SO YOU YOU SAID YOU DID IT IN PYTHON YEAH
YEAH DID YOU USE UH B THE X. L. UH X. M. L. PARSER IN PYTHON
RIGHT
YEAH SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD
SO UM 'CAUSE YEAH
I WAS HAVING A LOOK IN IT A LOOK AT IT AS WELL AND I NOTICED THE UM THE SPEAKERS ARE ALL IN THAT SEPARATE FILE
SO DID DID YOU HAVE TO COMBINE THEM ALL AND AND THEN RE ORDER THEM
YEAH
YE YEAH C
RIGHT
YEAH SO THAT'S APPROACH UM WELL I WAS GOING TO DO
SO YEAH WE MAY AS WELL COLLABORATE
IN THE WORD FILES
I'M NOT SURE I WHAT YOU MEAN
OH RIGHT
HMM
HMM
MM I THOUGHT THEY WERE LOCAL TO TH A PARTICULAR MEETING
HMM
MM IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE SHOULD DISCUSS
YEAH SHOULD WE NOT HAVE LIKE A GROUP DIRECTORY OR SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN PUT ALL OUR CODE IN AND THAT KINDA THING
HMM
I'VE GOTTEN MM HARDLY ANY
HMM
YEAH WE CAN ASK STEVE IF UM WE CAN GET SPACE
YEAH UH WE COULD DO THAT
YEAH I'M SURE HE HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT LAST YEAR
YEAH
HMM
THAT SOUNDS GOOD
HMM
HMM
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA NEED
YES
YEAH IT'S JUST MO CHANGING IT A BIT
YEAH
NO BUT UH THAT'S WHAT M. L. C. SEG DOES
IT IT MARKS THE END OF EACH SEGMENT
YEAH
YEAH
OH
YEAH
YEAH FOR ME IT'S BETTER IF THEY'RE BY MEETING
THEN THAT'LL BE REALLY EASY TO DO ONCE THEY'VE GOT THE RAW TEXT
IT'S JUST A CASE OF RUNNING THE SCRIPT
YEAH I MEAN HOPEFULLY THIS WEEK
ALRIGHT
AND WE COULD
DON'T KNOW
SUPPOSE WE'RE JUST GETTING ON WITH ALL OUR
COMPONENTS
SO
I KNOW
WA
YEAH
YEAH HE SUGGESTED THAT WE COULD HAVE AN UH INITIAL PROTOTYPE
I KNOW I'D B I'D BE SURPRISED IF WE CAN GET ANYTHING WORKING BY NEXT WEEK
ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN IF WE JUST WANT TO HAVE UM SOME DATA FOR THE USER FACE COULD EVEN BE RANDOM DATA
UH MM MM
YEAH I'M
HMM
YES
HMM YES
HMM
I'M NOT SO SURE
I I THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST HAVE LIKE UM ONE BIG SUMMARY UM WITH ALL THE UH DIFFERENT IMPORTANCE LEVELS UM DISPLAYED ON IT
AND DEPENDING ON WHAT OUR UM ZOOM LEVEL IS WE JUST DISPLAY A PART OF IT
AND WE WOULD HAVE ONE VERY BIG THING OFF LINE
AND FROM THAT WE WOULD JUST SELECT WHAT WE ARE DISPLAYING
YES
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD UM GIVE A HIGH VALUE TO THOSE UM SEQUENCES YOU WANT TO DISPLAY IN THE MEETING SERIES SUMMARY
AND YOU JUST CUT OFF
THAT WAS WHAT I SH I THOUGHT YEAH
I THOUGHT
BUT I THINK THE M DIFFERENCE MIGHT BE THAT WE WANT JUST WANT TO HAVE UM THE WORDS
AND THAT'S NOT SO MUCH WHAT HE MEANT WITH NOT POSSIBLY LOADING EVERYTHING WAS THAT YOU M UM LOAD ALL THE UH ANNOTATION STUFF
ALL THE SOUND FILES ALL
IN
UM I R I I'M GETTING QUITE LOST UM AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE UM W WHAT'S UM OUR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UM SE UM UH THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE AND THE SKIMMING
I MEAN DO WE DO BOTH OR IS IT THE SAME THING
OKAY
SO BUT WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUMMARIES YOU TALK ABOUT THIS UH ABO ABOUT SKIMMING AND NOT ABOUT
YEAH
YEAH RIGHT ISN'T THAT THE SKIMMING
ISN'T THAT THE SKIMMING
YEAH BUT IT USE THE SAME DATA
YEAH
A
AND YEAH I THINK WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT COMBINING THAT MEASURE WITH UM THE MEASURES I GET FROM UM S UH HOT SPOTS AND SO ON
SO THAT WOULD ALSO BE ON UTTERANCE LEVEL I THINK
I THINK
YES SURE
YES
YES RIGHT
OOPS IT DOES
SO I DEFINE BASELINE AND WHAT IT LOADS
FOR EXAMPLE IT LOADS ALL THE UTTERANCES AND SO ON BUT IT DOESN'T LOAD UM THE DISCOURSE ACTS AND FOR EXAMPLE NOT THE AND WHAT'S WHAT ELSE THERE
NOT THE SUMMARIES
IT ONLY LOADS THOSE ON DEMAND
Y YOU MEAN THAT YOU UM BASICALLY SPLIT UP TH THE BIG THING INTO UM DIFFERENT SUMMARIES
FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE A VERY UM TOP LEVEL UM SUMMARY AND A SEPARATE FILE FOR FOR EACH LEVEL
MM-HMM
YES
N UH NO NO IT'S F FOR
NO YOU'RE RIGHT
YEAH
IT'S FOR
UM
NO I I THINK WE WOULD JUST TAKE THE SEGMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY THAT WERE YEAH THERE'S UM THIS SEGMENTS FILE
UM YOU KNOW THE X. M. L. SEGMENTS
OH
THAT I DON'T KNOW
YEAH THAT'S UM
MM-HMM
THERE THERE ARE TIME STAMPS UM FOR WELL
SEGMENTS UM AND FOR TH UM SEGMENTS IS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA WHAT IS DISPLAYED IN ONE LINE
WHAT WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN THE HMM
I THINK SO
ISN'T
UM FOR EX UM I I COMPARED IT WITH WHAT I DID FOR THE PAUSE UM DURATION EXTRACTION
UM AND BASICALLY IT'S UH WORDS THAT ARE UTTERED IN A SEQUENCE WITHOUT PAUSES
BUT SOMETIMES UM HOWEVER THERE ARE UM SHORT PAUSES IN IT AND THEY'RE INDICATED BY SQUARE BRACKETS PAUSE OR SOMETHING IN THE DATA
UM SOMETI UH BUT UH THE ANNOTATORS DECIDED WHAT WAS ONE SEGMENT AND WHAT WASN'T
I THINK SO
YEAH BUT UM I THINK FOR SOME ANNOTATIONS UM AN UTTERA CA UTTERANCE CAN HAVE SEVERAL UM TYPES
FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE DIALOGUE ACTS AND SO ON
OKAY
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE FOR
YEAH
SHOULD BE YEAH
YES BUT THAT'S
YEAH EVERYTHING THAT'S A WORD HAS A STI TIME STAMP
THAT'S AT THE END
THAT'S AT THE END I THINK HER TIME
YEAH MAYBE
DIDN'T HAVE A LOOK AT OUR MEETINGS
UH I I THINK IT WOULDN'T AS IT OCCURS I MEAN IT WOULD BE IT OCCURS IN EVERY MEETING
SO
AND I THINK IT EVEN HAS UH ITS OWN ANNOTATION LIKE DIGITS OR SOMETHING
SO THAT SHOULD BE REALLY EASY TO CUT OUT
YEAH
I'M SURE
AH IT'S JUST TO TEST THE SYSTEM I THINK
SO
MM THEY HAVE TO READ NUMBERS FROM
UH I DIDN'T HAVE A LOOK AT THAT
SO
THEY
MM-HMM
UH TH YEAH
'KAY
UM I JUST UM WONDERED SO WHO'S UH THEN DOING UM THE FREQUENCIES ON ON THE WORDS
BECAUSE I'M I THINK I WILL ALSO UM I COULD ALSO MAKE USE OF IT UM FOR THE AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT THING
BECAUSE I UM I IN MY OUTLINE I TALKED ABOUT UM USING THE UM DISCOURSE ACTS FIRST
AND UM THEN IN THE CHUNKS OF TEXT I FOUND LOOKING FOR WORD PATTERNS AND SO ON
SO UM I WOULD FOR EXAMPLE NEED THE UM MOST FREQ UM FREQUENT WORDS
SO IF YOU CUT OFF ALL THAT I'D WON'T BE USE OR
YEAH I I BUT I NEED IT FOR MY CHUNKS THEN
I WOULD
YOU KNOW
YEAH BUT I'D UH I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY OF WORDS IN MY UM IN THE REGIONS OF TEXT I FOUND OUT TO BE INTERESTING
SO I WOULDN'T NEED IT
IT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE RE CALCULATED ONLY FOR MY SEGMENTS
HUH
UH UH MM
I THINK IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW L AS AS BIG AT AS THE HOT SPOT ANNOTATION THINGS
THAT'S QUITE SMALL YEAH THAT'S SOME UTTERANCES
YES
YEAH YEAH
SO I WOULD PROBABLY JUST CONCATENATE ALL MY UM TEXT CHUNKS AND THEN LET'S SAY M I WILL RUN OVER IT
YES
YES DEFINITELY
YEAH RIGHT
YE
M
UM JASMINE UH UM WHAT IS UM THE TEXT YOU'RE EXTRACTING UH LOOKING LIKE THEN AT THE END
BECAUSE UM I I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I DID FOR MY UM SPEAKER UM UH EXTRACTION AND I THINK I WOULD CH PERHAPS HAVE TO CHANGE TWO LINES OF CODES TO GET YOU UM FOR EACH MEETING A FILE THAT SAYS FR FROM UM THIS MILLISECOND TO THIS MILLISECOND THERE WAS THIS SEQUENCE OF WORDS
AND SO ON
SO THAT'S JUST CHANGING TWO LINES OF CODE
AND IT WOULD GIVE YOU THAT
SO
UM YEAH
SO FAR I EXTRACTED UM THE DURA DURATIONS
BUT IT'S FROM THE WORDS FILE
SO I COULD JUST UM CONTATENATE CONCATENATE UM THE WORDS INSTEAD OF THE DURATIONS AND IT SHOULD I MEAN
SHOULD BE VERY
STRAIGHT FORWARD
I CAN TRY TO DO IT AND SEND IT TO YOU
PE AND YOU HAVE A LOOK AT IT WILL IT MAKE SENSE FOR WHAT YOU WANT
YEAH UH P I MEAN IT I JUST LET IT RUN OVER ALL THE FILES
SO
YES
I JUST ORDERED
UH I ORDERED ACCORDING TO THE UM STARTING TIMES OF THE UTTERANCES
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DIFFE
YEAH I MEAN T I I HAVE ONE WHAT I GIVE YOU WOULD BE ONE FILE FOR EACH MEETING
YEAH NOT FOR EACH MEETING SERIES
I DIDN'T DO THAT YET
YEAH ONE GROUP YEAH
YEAH I MEAN THERE'S ONE SERIES THAT HAS JUST ONE MEETING
YES
UM THE YOU YOU THE DATA IS OF THE FORM YOU HAVE UM THREE IDENTIFICATION LETTER
SO B. E. D. OR B. B. D. OR SOMETHING AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE SAME GROUP
AND THEN AFTER THAT THERE'S UM A NUMBER LIKE O. O. ONE O. O. TWO
SO IT'S A
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY QUITE EASY TO SEE BECAUSE THEY'RE NAMED
YES
BUT I I MEAN AS UM THE START UH START TIMES UM START FOR EACH MEETING AT ZERO
YOU COULD JUST PROBABLY JUST UM ADD THE UM FINAL SECOND TIME TO THE NEXT MEETING AND SO ON AND JUST PUT IT ALL TOGETHER
BUT THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE UM THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO ON WHICH CHANNEL IT WAS SET UM TO BY WHICH PERSON IT WAS SET
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY STORED IN ANOTHER X. M. L. DOCUMENT
YEAH I W WOULD THEN JUST NOT PRINT OUT THE UM START AND END TIMES
NO IT'S FOR EVERY SINGLE WORD
OR FOR EVERY SINGLE UTTERANCE
YEAH THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT
YEAH BUT I DO IT WITH PERL IT'S JUST STRING MANIPULATION
SO I WOULD I MEAN I WOULD JUST
SURE
NO I DIDN'T DO A SEA NO
AND YOU WOULD WANT THAT ALL IN ONE FILE FOR ALL THE CORPUS
OR
FOR THE SERIES
YEAH I CAN DIRECTLY PUT IT INTO UH JUST LIKE
SO UH ONLY WORDS UM PER MEETING SERIES
UH-HUH
YES
YEAH THEY WILL JUST I WILL JUST TAKE I WOULD UH TAKE OVER THE NAMES THEY HAVE ANYWAY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH ONE SERIES HAS THE UM SAME THREE STARTING LETTERS
SO
SO ONLY WORDS AND WORDS AND TIMES
AND YOU
YEAH YOU WANT IT ORDERED
OKAY
OKAY ANYBODY
UM ORD BASE DOT TIMES
YEAH AND DO YOU WANT
YEAH SOMETIMES THEY'RE CONTAINED IN ONE ANOTHER
SO
JUST AFTER TH MM-HMM
'KAY
ORDERED
ONLY WORDS
UM AND I THINK UM FOR ALL THE CORPUS IT'S JUST FROM I KNOW FROM OTHER TIMES
IT'S UM NINE MEGAMI BYTE TO HAVE I MEAN SHOULD BE SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO HAVE THE WORDS
SHOULD BE
NA UM ALL THE WORDS TOGETHER UM FOR ALL THE MEETINGS
THAT'S WHAT I'M GUESSING THAT'S YOU KNOW
UM WHAT I BECAUSE NINE MEGA BYTE IS WHAT I GOT FOR WHEN I SAID FOR EVERY UM UTTERANCE THIS IS GOES FROM THERE TO THERE AND
TAKES TAKES SECONDS
OH
YEAH I MEAN I'M IT DOING IT FOR ALL OF IT
DOESN'T MATTER
YEAH I MEAN I HOPE IT WILL BE THE SAME FOR THE WORDS
IT'S JUST WHAT I
I
MM-HMM
MM
SO SO UM I WILL PROBABLY SEND UM JUST ONE FILE OF THE FIRST MEETING UM TO ALL THOSE WHO NEED IT SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK WHETHER THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
YEAH I MEAN IF IT'S JUST FOR ONE MEETING IT'S REALLY NOT TOO BIG
YEAH
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE
THE BASIC WORD IMPORTANCE IS OFF LINE AS WELL
THE COMBINED MEASURE MIGHT NOT BE IF WE WANT TO WAIT WHAT THE USER HAS TYPED IN INTO THE SEARCH
YEAH
I'M NOT QUITE SO WHAT IT DID YOU WANT TO DO IT I YOU JUST WANTED TO ASSIGN
UH I THOUGHT ABOUT WORDS
MM
MM OKAY
YEAH BUT HOW ABOUT THOSE WORDS WHICH DON'T CARRY ANY MEANING AT ALL THE UM AND UHS AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BECAUSE IF WE IF WE AVERAGE AVERAGE OVER OVER A WHOLE UTTERANCE ALL THE WORDS
AND THERE ARE QUITE UNIMPORTANT WORDS IN THERE BUT QUITE IMPORTANT WORDS AS WELL I THINK WE SHOULD JUST DISREGARD THE THE
OKAY
ALRIGHT
YEAH
BUT THERE IS NO I. D. FOR AN UTTERANCE I THINK
IT'S JUST FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT THEN
WE FOR UTTERANCES AS WELL
I THINK IT'S JUST FOR ONE
WORD
SO WE HAVE TO
YEAH
UH I'M NOT QUITE SURE I HAVE ONLY SEEN THAT THE UH THE INDIVIDUAL WORDS HAVE GOT AN I. D.
YEAH
YOU ALWAYS COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE TIME STAMPS AND THEN TAKE THE ONES THAT UH BELONG TOGETHER TO FORM AN UTTERANCE
YEAH IF THEY ARE ALREADY THERE'S IT'S EASY BUT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
UH YEAH
OKAY
YOU S UH YOU SAID YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN UH IMPLEMENTING THE IDEA
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU COMPUTING
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I W I W I WOULD NEED THE RAW TEXT PRETTY SOON BECAUSE I HAVE TO FIND OUT UM HOW I HAVE TO PUT THE SEGMENTS INTO BINS
AND THEN YEAH
NO THAT'S NOT NECESSARY
YES I DID
BUT UM I'VE ONLY JUST GOT THE NOTES
I HAVE TO STILL HAVE UH TO ORDER EVERYTHING BY THE TIME AND
YEAH I THINK IT'S QUITE EASY AFTER THE
YEAH
YEAH
SO UH
MM-HMM
YEAH B I UH W THAT'S WHAT I WAS UH THOUGHT
THAT YOU JUST COMBINE THEM AND THEN ORDER THE TIME STAMPS ACCORDINGLY
OKAY
UM WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS THAT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF THINGS WITHOUT WITHOUT S TIME STAMPS IN THE BEGINNING
YEAH AND UH X. M. L. FILES
YEAH THAT'S JUST AN I. D. OR SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW
JUST NUMBERS
YES BUT WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS THAT'S UH SOME KIND OF NUMBER
F MAYBE THE FILE NUMBER OR SOMETHING THAT IS IN THE BEGINNING
WHAT IS THAT
DO YOU KNOW
UM I THINK THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF NUMBERS IN THE BEGINNING WHERE N THERE IS NO TIME STAMP FOR THE NUMBERS
IT'S
THINK THEY SAY UM QUITE A LOT OF NUMBERS AND BEFORE THAT UH UM THERE'S THIS NUMBER
WAS IT
YEAH THERE I ARE NUMBERS IN THE UM THE W. TAG BUT THERE ARE NO TIME STAMPS
YEAH
YEAH IN THE BEGINNING AS WELL SOMETIMES I THINK
AT LEAST I SAW SOME
YEAH
YEAH
BUT WHAT IT IS IT ACTUALLY THAT NUMBERS
OKAY SO BUT THERE ARE NO TIME STAMPS ANNOTATED TO THAT
IT'S IT'S QUITE STRANGE
AND ALSO UM THERE ARE DIFFERENT UM COMBINATIONS OF LETTERS
B. R. E. AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IS IT EVERYTHING ORDERED ARE THE TIME STAMPS GLOBAL OR UH ARE THEY LOCAL AT ANY POINT
OKAY
YEAH IT'S RAINBOW
IT'S UM I THINK IT'S JUST THE DICTIONARY IN THE FIRST PLACE
BUT
UM NO I HAVE TO BIN IT UP AND SO I WILL ONLY HAVE COUNTS FOR EACH EACH BIN OR SOMETHING
IT'S BECAUSE UM RAINBOW IS A TEXT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
AND I THINK IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE JUST ONE CLASS
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
MAYBE WE COULD
YEAH SURE YOU SURE WE COULD DO THAT BUT I DON'T THAT MAKES SENSE
IF WE NEED JUST FREQUENCIES MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CALCULATE THEM BY USING PERL OR SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH IT'S QUITE EASY TO JUST COUNT AND S OR SORT THEM BY UM FREQUENCY
JUST USING A PERL SCRIPT
IS IT TOO BIG
YEAH
HMM
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HOW MANY TERMS YOU CAN HANDLE IN PERL
MM YEAH
UH I CAN GET ALL THE RAW TEXT BUT IT HAS TO BE ORDERED STILL
SO
NO IT ISN'T
UM IT'S IN WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED IN RAINBOW IS INFORMATION GAIN AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY CALCULATE THAT
YEAH
UH THAT'S WHAT RAINBOW DOES
I THINK YOU J CAN JUST GET PROBABILITIES FOR A CERTAIN WORDS FOR EACH DOCUMENT
CERTAIN
UM WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT
MM-HMM
OH
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AS WELL THAT YOU THAT PROBABLY THE THE TOPIC SEGMENT LEVEL IS THE MOST UM INFORMATIVE FOR THE WORDS
YEAH THAT'S THE PROBLEM
I DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
SO SHALL WE SIT TOGETHER TOMORROW THEN AS WELL
UH OKAY
UM YEAH W WOULD IT BE BEST
AT THE MOMENT IT'S IT'S JUST LINES OF
MM-HMM
UM
OKAY
SO UM YOU'D DO YOU EXTRACT THE WORDS THE RAW TEXT AS WELL
UH
OKAY
MM-HMM
PRINT OUT
OKAY
OKAY THAT
OKAY
SO HAVE WE ALREADY EXTRACTED FROM ALL THE FILES
YEAH
DID YOU ALSO ORDER
MM-HMM
HMM
HMM
OKAY
UH I DON'T NEED THE TIMES I JUST NEED THE WORDS
BUT UM
YEAH IN THE RIGHT ORDER
YES
YEAH THAT DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH I THINK
HMM
MM-HMM
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO MAKE THE FREQUENCY COUNTS WITH A JAVA HASH TABLE
YEAH
NO HOW LONG YOU WOULD HAVE TO PROGRAM SOMETHING
OKAY
MM
BECAUSE IT'S QUITE EASY IN PERL AS WELL IT'S JUST A LINE OF CODE FOR COUNTING ALL THE WORDS AND YEAH IT'S IT'S BY HASHES
YEAH
YEAH
'KAY
I I DRY READ IT THE LAST TIME
NEXT WEEK
YEAH
YEAH
NO
UH MINE'S GONNA BE MOSTLY USING THE OFF LINE
BUT THE ACTUAL STUFF IT'S DOING WILL BE ON LINE
BUT IT WON'T BE VERY UM PROCESSOR INTENSIVE OR MEMORY INTENSIVE I DON'T THINK
DON'T THINK SO
YEAH
ARE WE STILL GONNA GO FOR DUMPING IT INTO A DATABASE
ARE WE STILL GONNA DUMP IT INTO A DATABASE
'CAUSE IF WE ARE I RECKON WE SHOULD ALL READ OUR CLASSES OUT OF THE DATABASE
IT'LL BE SO MUCH EASIER
WELL IF WE'RE GONNA DUMP THE PART OF IT INTO A DATABASE ANYWAY
WE MIGHT AS WELL DUMP ALL THE FIELDS WE WANT INTO THE DATABASE CALCULATE EVERYTHING FROM THERE
THEN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WORRY THAT MUCH ABOUT THE UNDERLYING X. M. L. REPRESENTATION
WE CAN JUST QUERY IT
WELL IF WE'RE GONNA DO THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND STORE EVERYTHING IN IN AN X. M. L. FORMAT AS WELL
YEAH
YEAH
WELL WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO DO THAT 'CAUSE IF WE GOT OUR INFORMATION DENSITY CALCULATED OFF LINE
SO ALL WE DO IS TREAT THE WHOLE LOT AS ONE MASSIVE DOCUMENT
I MEAN THEY'LL IT'S NOT GONNA BE SO BIG THAT WE CAN'T LOAD IN A INFORMATION DENSITY FOR EVERY UTTERANCE
AND WE CAN JUST SUMMARISE BASED ON THAT
I THINK YOU CAN DO IT ON LINE
I DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY MUCH POINT IN DOING LIKE THAT WHEN IT'S JUST GONNA FEED OFF IN THE END THE INFORMATION DENSITY MEASURE BASICALLY
AND THAT'S ALL CALCULATED OFF LINE
SO WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING IS SORTING A LIST IS THE P COMPUTATIONALLY HARD PART OF IT
WELL LIKE THE IDEAS WE'RE CALCULATING ARE INFORMATION DENSITY ALL OFF LINE FIRST FOR EVERY UTTERANCE IN THE WHOLE CORPUS RIGHT
SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SAY IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SERIES OF MEETINGS YOU JUST SAY WELL OUR WHOLE DOCUMENT COMPRISES OF ALL THESE STUCK TOGETHER
AND THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SORT THEM BY J INFORMATION DENSITY
LIKE MAYBE WEIGHTED WITH THE SEARCH TERMS AND THEN EXTRACT THEM
I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO SLOW TO DO ON LINE TO BE HONEST
IS THAT
YEAH
WELL ON THE UTTERANCE LEVEL I WAS THINKING
SO THE UTTERANCES WITH THE HIGHEST LIKE MEAN INFORMATION DENSITY
WELL THE TROUBLE WITH DOING IT ON THE WORD LEVEL IS IF YOU WANT THE AUDIO TO SYNCH UP
YOU'VE GOT NO WAY OF GETTING IN AND EXTRACTING JUST THAT WORD
I MEAN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
FOR EVERY SINGLE WORD
OH OKAY
YEAH
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL DO IT
WE'LL HAVE TO BUFFER IT
WELL THE SKIMMING'S GONNA USE THE IMPORTANCE
BUT LIKE AT FIRST IT'S JUST GONNA BE I. D. F.
WELL MOSTLY SKIMMING YEAH
YEAH
WELL THE NICE THING ABOUT THAT IS IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE IN SENTENCES
WELL MORE OR LESS
SO IT WILL MAKE MORE SENSE AND IF YOU GET JUST EXTRACT WORDS
YEAH
I SEE IT
BUT IT'LL NEED TO BE CALCULATED AT WORD LEVEL THOUGH BECAUSE OTHERWISE THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH OCCURRENCES OF THE TERMS TO MAKE ANY MEANINGFUL SENSE
YEAH
YEAH I RECKON YOU CAN JUST MEAN IT OVER THE SENTENCE
I THINK WE SHOULD FILTER THEM
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE UM A CUT OFF
SO IT A W WORD ONLY GETS A VALUE IF IT'S ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD
SO ANYTHING THAT HAS LESS THAN SAY NOUGHT POINT FIVE IMPORTANCE GETS ASSIGNED TO ZERO
YEAH THAT'S THE OTHER TH
YEAH
I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO BUFFER THE AUDIO
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE VERY HARD
I THINK IT WOULD BE LIKE AN HOUR OR TWO'S WORK
LIKE JUST BUILD AN ANOTHER F WAVE FILE ESSENTIALLY
YEAH I MEAN I BET THERE WOULD BE PACKAGES
IN MEMORY YEAH
SO JUST LIKE UNP THERE'S BOUND TO BE LIKE A MEDIA WAVE OBJECT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND JUST BUILD ONE IN MEMORY
I DON'T KNOW
I HAVE NO IDEA
BUT IT MUST HAVE LIKE CLASSES FOR DEALING WITH FILES
AND IF IT HAS CLASSES FOR CONCATENATING FILES YOU CAN DO IT IN MEMORY
SO
WELL WHAT I THINK I MIGHT TRY AND BUILD IS BASICALLY A CLASS THAT YOU JUST FEED IT A LINKED LIST OF UM DIFFERENT WAVE FORMS
AND IT WILL JUST STRING THEM ALL TOGETHER WITH MAYBE I DON'T KNOW TENTH OF A SECOND SILENCE IN BETWEEN EACH ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
NORMALISE IT YEAH
OH YEAH YEAH WE'LL NEED THAT
WE ALSO REALLY WANNA BE ABLE TO SEARCH BY WHO'S SPEAKING AS WELL
IT DOESN'T MATTER 'CAUSE ALL THE CALCULATION'S DONE OFF LINE
THAT'S EASY
YOU JUST LIKE CREATE A NEW X. M. L. DOCUMENT IN MEMORY
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE IF IT'S TOO BIG WHAT WE CAN DO IS JUST WELL ALL THE OFF LINE STUFF DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
AND ALL WE CAN DO IS JUST PROCESS A BIT AT A TIME
LIKE FOR SUMMARISATION SAY WE WANTED A HUNDRED UTTERANCES IN THE SUMMARY JUST LOOK AT THE MEETING TAKE THE TOP ONE HUNDRED UTTERANCES IN EACH OTHER MEETING
IF IT SCORES HIGHER THAN THE ONES ALREADY IN THE SUMMARY SO FAR JUST REPLACE THEM
AND THEN YOU ONLY HAVE TO PROCESS ONE MEETING AT A TIME
OKAY SO MAYBE WE SHOULD BUILD A B STORE A MEAN MEASURE FOR THE SEGMENTS AND MEETINGS AS WELL
AND SPEAKER
SPEAKER AND UM TOPIC SEGMENTING WE'LL NEED AS WELL
YEAH
WELL YEAH AND THEN IT'LL F PRESERVE THE ORDER WHEN IT'S DISPLAYED THE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO
SO WE SHOULD BASICALLY MAKE OUR OWN X. M. L. DOCUMENT IN MEMORY
THAT EVERYONE'S UM
MODULE CHANGES THAT RATHER THAN THE UNDERLYING DATA
AND THEN HAVE THAT X. M. L. UH NITE X. M. L. DOCUMENT TIED TO THE INTERFACE
WELL YOU CAN MAKE IT IN A FILE IF YOU WANT
MM-HMM
THEY ARE UTTERANCES AREN'T THEY
THE SEGMENTS ARE UTTERANCES AREN'T THEY
YEAH
ALRIGHT OKAY
WELL THAT'S EASY
WELL IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH ISN'T IT
IT MAY NOT BE EXACT EVERY TIME BUT IT'S A SO SORT OF SIZE WE'RE LOOKING FOR
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST WRITE IT AS A NEW X. M. L. FILE
CAN NITE HANDLE JUST LOADING ARBITRARY UH NEW LIKE ATTRIBUTES AND STUFF
I MEAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY'D MAKE IT ABLE TO
YEAH
SO WHY DO WE NEED TO HAVE TWO X. M. L. TREES IN MEMORY AT ONCE
THE OTHER THING IS THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D BE USING THEIR PARSER AS WELL WHICH MEANS WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PARSE ANYTHING WHICH BE QUITE NICE
'CAUSE THEIR PARSER IS PROBABLY MUCH FASTER THAN ANYTHING WE'VE COME UP WITH ANYWAY
YEAH I MEAN WE CAN PROCESS IT IN CHUNKS IF IT GETS TOO BIG BASICALLY
WE CAN JUST PROCESS IT ALL IN CHUNKS IF IT GETS TOO BIG TO LOAD IT INTO MEMORY
I THINK WE PROBABLY WANT TO STORE SORRY
I THINK WE PROBABLY WANT TO STORE UM A HIERARCHICAL INFORMATION DENSITY AS WELL
SO LIKE AN INFORMAN MATION DENSITY SCORE FOR EACH MEETING AND EACH TOPIC SEGMENT
'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE'D BE RECALCULATING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
YEAH
AND THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO DISPLAY
WELL IT MAY NOT FOR THE WHOLE MEETING BUT LIKE
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
WELL WE CAN START OFF
LIKE THAT
WELL I WAS GONNA START OFF I'VE V GOT SORT OF HALF WAY THROUGH IMPLEMENTING ONE THAT DOES JUST I. D. F.
AND THEN JUST I CAN CHANGE THAT TO WORK ON WHATEVER
YEAH
AND IT SHOULD BE WEIGHTED BY STUFF LIKE THE HOT SPOTS AND UM THE KEY WORDS IN THE SEARCH AND STUFF LIKE THAT
DID HE NOT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT NAMED ENTITIES
SO I THOUGHT HE SAID THERE WASN'T VERY MANY
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S NOT T. F. I. D. F. IT'S JUST INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY
'CAUSE IT'S REALLY EASY TO DO BASICALLY
THERE'S JUST LIKE FOR A BASELINE REALLY
WELL I'M HALF WAY THROUGH
IT'S NOT WORKING YET BUT IT WILL DO
UM YEAH
AND THEN AVERAGING IT OVER THE UTTERANCES
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE UM RELATED TO THE CORPUS AT ALL
IT'S JUST WORKING ON AN ARBITRARY TEXT FILE AT THE MOMENT
NO
IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO KNOW HOW EVERYONE'S GONNA STORE THEIR THINGS THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I'VE GOT LIKE A FEW HOURS FREE
LIKE AFTER THIS
IT'S THE MOST BORING TASK
YEAH
OR AT LEAST UM SIMPLE VERSIONS OF THEM
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY DOING SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE LIKE JUST DISPLAYING A WHOLE MEETING
AND LIKE JUST BEING ABLE TO SCROLL THROUGH IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
ARE YOU FREE AFTER THIS
HOW ABOUT FRIDAY THEN
'CAUSE I'M OFF ALL FRIDAY
UH WEDNESDAY I'VE GOT A NINE 'TIL TWELVE
YEAH NOTHING IN THE AFTERNOON
I'VE GOT NOTHING IN THE AFTERNOON
SO
OKAY
SO YOU HA YEAH
WHERE ABOUT JUST IN APPLETON TOWER
UH I'LL BE IN UM THE APPLETON TOWER ANYWAY
UM WELL I'LL BE THERE FROM TWELVE
I'VE GOT SOME OTHER STUFF THAT NEEDS DONE ON MATLAB SO IF YOU'RE NOT THERE AT TWELVE I CAN JUST WORK ON THAT
SO
YEAH
WHY W
YEAH
I'M JUST BUILDING A DICTIONARY
OH MINE'S JUST GONNA USE THE UM HASH MAP ONE IN UM JAVA
'CAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA DO IT ON SMALL DOCUMENTS
IT'S JUST LIKE BEF UNTIL THE INFORMATION DENSITY IS UP AND RUNNING
JUST SOMETHING TO GET GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WORK WITH
SO IT'S ONLY GONNA USE QUITE SMALL DOCUMENTS YOU SEE TO START WITH
WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE CLASSIFIED INTO LIKE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS
CAN WE JUST FILL A SECOND CLASS WITH JUNK THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT
LIKE I DON'T KNOW COPIES OF SHAKESPEARE OR SOMETHING
'CAUSE IF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE UM FREQUENCY STATISTICS I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD BE CHANGED BY THE CLASSIFICATION
I THE
WELL THERE MAYBE ANOTHER TOOL AVAILABLE
YEAH
UM I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO'S GOT IT
MIGHT BE WORDNET
BUT ONE OF THESE BIG CORPUSES HAS A LIST OF STOP WORDS THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD AND THEY'RE JUST BASICALLY LISTS OF REALLY UNINTERESTING BORING WORDS THAT WE COULD FILTER OUT BEFORE WE DO THAT
IT'S LIKE THAT'S ONE THE PAPERS I READ
THAT'S UM ONE THINGS THEY DID RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING IS THEY'VE GOT THIS BIG S STOP LIST AND THEY JUST IGNORE ALL OF THOSE THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT
YEAH I IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR ME AS WELL
IT UH I THINK THAT'D BE USEFUL FOR ME AS WELL
YEAH
YEAH
WELL ALL YOU REALLY WANNA DO IS LOOK INTO GETTING SOME SUB SET OF THE ICSI CORPUS OFF THE DICE MACHINES
'CAUSE I HATE WORKING ON DICE
IT'S AWFUL
LIKE SO I CAN USE MY HOME MACHINE
HA HAS A C. D. BURNER THOUGH
HAS A C. D. BURNER
YEAH
THE RIGHT HAND CORNER FAR RIGHT
YEAH
HOW BIG IS IT WITHOUT UM
THE WAV FILES AND STUFF
'CAUSE I COULD JUST SAY AT UM GOING OVER S. C. P. ONE NIGHT AND JUST LEAVE IT GOING ALL NIGHT IF I HAD TO
IT'S YEAH I MEAN THE WAVE DATA ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT GONNA GET OFF THERE COMPLETELY
REALLY
OH RIGHT
I'LL SEE IF I CAN S. C. P. IT I SUPPOSE
I'VE GOT A LINUX BOX AND A WINDOWS BOX
SO
BROAD BAND
PUT IT ON TO C. D.
I CAN IF I GET DOWN I CAN PUT TO C. D.
YEAH
I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE
IS HOW MUCH DO WE GET
REALLY
OKAY
YEAH BUT I CAN DO IT FROM THAT SESSION CAN'T I
YOU CAN COMPRESS IT FROM A REMOTE SESSION AND S. C. P. IT FROM THE SAME SESSION
DO YOU THINK
YEAH
OH NO NO I WAS THINKING OF SSHING JUST INTO SOME MACHINE AND THEN JUST SCPING IT FROM THERE
YEAH
I MEAN IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE GATEWAY
BUT
CAN YOU NOT DO THAT
MM I SEE
YEAH
SO YOU COULD JUST
BUT TH FIRST UH HOW BIG ARE THE CHUNKS
HOW BIG ARE THE CHUNKS YOU'RE LOOKING AT
SO QUITE SMALL THEN
SO YOU COULD JUST UM YOU COULD USE JUST THE SAME THING WE USED TO BUILD THE BIG DICTIONARY
YOU JUST DO THAT ON LINE 'CAUSE THAT WON'T TAKE LONG TO BUILD A LITTLE DICTIONARY THAT BIG WILL IT
I MEAN JUST USE THE SAME TOOL THAT WE USE
YEAH
YEAH
IT DOESN'T NEED ORDERED NO
UM WELL THAT'S THE T ARE YOU USING T. F. I. D. F. FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY
ALRIGHT OKAY
LIKE 'CAUSE FREQUENCY WOULD BE USEFUL I THINK
BUT UM DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT THE SIZE AND WHAT WE CONSIDER A DOCUMENT IN THE SENSE OF CALCULATING T. F. I. D. F. IS GONNA CHANGE
WHICH MIGHT NEED THINKING ABOUT
I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL YEAH
WELL YOU NEED THE RAW FREQUENCY AS WELL
BUT UM
YOU ALSO NEED HOW MANY TIMES THINGS OCCUR WITHIN EACH DOCUMENT
AND UM WHAT WE CONSIDER A DOCUMENT'S GONNA DEPEND ON OUR CONTEXT I THINK
'CAUSE IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE LOT OF MEETINGS WE'LL CONSIDER EACH MEETING A DOCUMENT IN SORT OF TERMS OF THIS ALGORITHM
AND IF WE'RE VIEWING LIKE SAY JUST A SMALL TOPIC SEGMENT YOU MIGHT LOOK AT EVEN EACH UTTERANCE AS A SMALL DOCUMENT
YEAH BUT THE THING IS UM
IT'S GONNA NEED SOME TH TH THOUGHT OF HOW WE
ACTUALLY MAYBE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER
MAYBE IF YOU JUST DO IT ONCE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT IT WILL BE FINE
BUT I WAS JUST THINKING IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE THE T. F. I. D. F. OFF LINE FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT LEVELS WE MIGHT WANT
'CAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA ALLOW DISJOINT SEGMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THEN HOW ARE WE GONNA KNOW WHAT'S GONNA BE IN CONTEXT AT ANY GIVEN TIME
BUT I SUPPOSE IF YOU JUST DID IT GLOBALLY TREATING A MEETING AS A DOCUMENT
IT'D PROBABLY STILL BE WORK OUT FINE BECAUSE YOU'D ONLY BE COMPARING TO ONES WITHIN THE CONTEXT
UH I DON'T KNOW I THOUGHT WERE YOU GONNA USE THAT IN THE END
THE INFORMATION DENSITY
OH SORRY THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
LIKE UM YEAH FOR EACH WORD OR WHATEVER BUT ACROSS THE WHOLE LOT IS WHAT I MEAN BY HIGHEST LEVEL
LIKE ACROSS THE WHOLE CORPUS
YEAH BUT YOU'D PROBABLY LOOK AT EACH MEETING AS A DOCUMENT
MM POSSIBLY
ARE THEY BIG ENOUGH TO GET ANYTHING MEANINGFUL OUT OF
WELL YEAH THAT IS NOT IT'S NOT AN ISSUE
YOU JUST CONCATENATE AN X. M. L. FILE TOGETHER
BUT WE STILL WANT TO HAVE LIKE A NOTION OF MEETINGS FOR THE USER
YEAH SURE
YEAH YOU JUST LIKE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO LOOK AT YOU JUST JAM TOGETHER INTO AN X. M. L. FILE AND THAT'S YOUR MEETING
EVEN THOUGH BITS OF IT MAY COME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE OR WHATEVER
I MEAN I DON'T SEE WHY THAT'S REALLY A BIG PROBLEM
SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU CAN TAKE AN ARBITRARY AMOUNT OF DATA AND PROCESS IT WITH THE SAME ALGORITHM
IT DOESN'T MATTER CONCEPTUALLY WHAT THAT DATA IS
IT COULD BE A MEETING
IT COULD BE TWO UTTERANCES
IT COULD BE A MEETING PLUS HALF A MEETING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THOUGH
I MEAN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST BUILD AN X. M. L. FILE AND IF YOU WANT IT TO GET DOWN TO THE UTTERANCES YOU'D GO TO THE LEAVES
AND THEN IF YOU WANTED THE NEXT LEVEL UP
YOU'D GO TO THE PARENTS OF THOSE AND LIKE JUST GO FROM LIKE THE LEAVES INWARDS TOWARDS THE BRANCH TO BUILD UP THINGS LIKE UM YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU CLICK ON A SEGMENT IT'S GONNA HAVE LIKE WORDS OR WHATEVER THAT ARE IMPORTANT
AS LONG AS LIKE THE ALGORITHMS ARE DESIGNED UM WITH IT IN MIND I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY BIG PROBLEM
WELL LIKE SAY YOU HAD UM LIKE SAY FOR A MEETING RIGHT YOU'VE GOT LIKE UH SAY A HIERARCHY THAT LOOKS QUITE BIG LIKE THIS
AND LIKE THE UTTERANCES COME OFF OF HERE MAYBE
THEN WHEN WHATEVER YOUR ALGORITHM IS DOING AS LONG AS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH UTTERANCES YOU GO FOR ALL THE LEAVES
LIKE THEN IF YOU NEED SOMETHING NEXT UP SO LIKE A TOPIC SEGMENT YOU'D GO TO HERE
BUT IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT SAY THIS ONE SO ONLY WENT LIKE THIS
RIGHT SO YOU IT'S SAME YOU'D START WITH THE LEAVES AND YOU GO OH I WANT A TOPIC SEGMENT
SO I GO ONE LAYER UP
SEE AND THEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH JUST A TOPIC SEGMENT IN THERE IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
AND LIKE EACH TIME YOU WANT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU JUST NEED TO GO UP THE TREE
AND AS LONG AS YOUR ALGORITHM RESPECTS THAT THEN WE CAN JUST
PROCESS ANY ARBITRARY X. M. L.
FILE WITH WHATEVER HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE WE WANT
A MEETING SAY AND THAT WOULD BE A TOPIC SEGMENT
SO I THINK AS LONG AS YOU BUILD AN ALGORITHM THAT RESPECTS WHATEVER STRUCTURE'S IN THE FILE RATHER THAN IMPOSING ITS OWN STRUCTURE
WELL NO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
BUT I MEAN IT COULD BE AS MANY NODES AS YOU WANT
LIKE THIS ONE COULD BE DEEPER MAYBE
SAY
SO THEN YOU'D START WITH ALL YOUR UTTERANCES HERE AND WHEN YOU GO UP TO GET TOPIC SEGMENTS YOU GO TO HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE
THAT MIGHT BE A BIT CONFUSING THOUGH 'CAUSE YOU HAVE THINGS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS
WELL WEDNESDAY
YEAH
YEAH
SO WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET LIKE A MINI BROWSER JUST DISPLAYS TWO THINGS SYNCHED TOGETHER OF SOME KIND
YEAH
YEAH
IT'D BE USEFUL
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU SEE ABOUT THAT THOUGH
I D HAVE NO IDEA
I'VE PROBABLY GOT A REASONABLE AMOUNT BECAUSE UM EVERYTHING ON MY DICE ACCOUNT CAN ACTUALLY BE DELETED 'CAUSE I STORE IT ALL AT HOME AS WELL
IS THAT GUARANTEED TO STAY THE
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEND A SUPPORT FORM
JUST SAY WE WANT SOME WEB SPACE
LISTEN TO
YEAH
'CAUSE THAT'D BE REALLY USEFUL IS IF WE HAD A BIG DIRECTORY
ESPECIALLY FOR TRANSFERRING STUFF
HAVING SAID THAT ARE WE ALLOWED TO TAKE A COPY OF THE ICSI CORPUS
SOMETHING WE SHOULD PROBABLY ASK BEFORE WE DO IT
OKAY
OKAY
NO ME NEITHER
MIGHT BE FUNNY TO SEE WHAT IS SUMMARISED THE WHOLE CORPUS AS ANYWAY
I THINK IT'D BE VERY USEFUL
BUT
WE CAN JUST CHANGE THE CODE
IS THAT IT
THAT'S QUITE GOOD
YEAH
I COULD JUST USE IT WITH THE FREQUENCY I THINK UNTIL THE INFORMATION DENSITY THING'S FINISHED
THAT WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL
IF YOU'RE DOING IT IN JAVA COULD YOU UM SERIALIZE THE OUTPUT AS WELL AS WRITING IT TO A FILE
IF YOU'RE DOING IT IN JAVA COULD YOU SERIALIZE THE UM DICTIONARY YEAH AS WELL AS WRITING IT TO A FILE
IT'S REALLY EASY
I DON'T SEE WHY IT'D BE ANY MORE MASSIVE THAN THE FILE
YEAH
IT JUST SAVES YOU PARSING THE UM
FILE REPRESENTATION OF IT
AND NOW 'CAUSE I WOULD BE USING IT IN JAVA ANYWAY
SO I'D JUST BE BUILDING THE DATA STRUCTURE AGAIN
YEAH BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A BIT SILLY TO BE PARSING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN KINDA THING
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT UM I THINK ALL THE COLLECTIONS AND THINGS IMPLEMENT SERIALIZABLE ALREADY
I THINK THEY MIGHT DO
TONIGHT I'LL TRY AND UM I'LL EITHER WORK SOME MORE ON UH THE T. F. I. D. F. SUMMARIZER OR DO THE AUDIO THING
YEAH
DO WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE SOMETHING NEXT WEEK
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW
I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE WE HAD TO SPECIFY IT OURSELVES THAT IT'S NOT AS UM LIKE FOCUS THE SPECIFICATION OF MOST UM WORK WE HAVE TO DO
YEAH
ONCE WE START DOING IT IT WILL ALL BECOME MORE OR LESS OBVIOUS I THINK ANYWAY
'KAY
GOSH
'KAY
IS THERE MUCH MORE IN IT THAN HE D
IS THERE MUCH MORE IN IT THAN HE SAID YESTERDAY
MM
HMM
HMM
YEAH NOW I'D SAY IF FOR THE PROTOTYPE IF WE JUST LIKE WHEREVER POSSIBLE P CHUNK IN THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE UM PRE ANNOTATED AND STUFF
AND FOR THE STUFF THAT WE DON'T HAVE PRE ANNOTATED WRITE LIKE A STUPID BASELINE
THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO BASICALLY THAT MEANS WE FOCUS ON ON THE INTERFACE FIRST SORT OF
SO THAT WE WE TAKE THE THE READY MADE PARTS AND JUST SEE HOW WE GET THEM WORK TOGETHER IN THE INTERFACE THE WAY WE WANT AND AND THEN WE HAVE A WORKING PROTOTYPE
AND THEN WE CAN GO BACK AND REPLACE PIECES EITHER BY OUR OWN COMPONENTS OR BY MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPO PO COMPONENTS OF OUR OWN
SO IT'S PROBABLY FEASIBLE
THE THING IS I'M AWAY THIS WEEKEND
SO THAT'S FOR ME
OH YEAH UM YEAH
NO
BUT ALSO I MIGHT LIKE THE THE SIMILARITY THING LIKE MY JUST MY MATRIX ITSELF FOR MY STUFF
I C I I THINK I CAN DO THAT FAIRLY QUICKLY BECAUSE I HAVE THE ALGORITHMS
YEAH I THINK TODAY'S MEETING IS REALLY THE ONE WHERE WE WHERE WE SORT OF SETTLE DOWN THE DATA STRUCTURE AND AS SOON AS WE HAVE THAT
UH PROBABLY LIKE AFTER TODAY'S MEETING WE THEN ACTUALLY NEED TO
WELL GO BACK FIRST OF ALL AND LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. TO SEE IN HOW FAR THAT THAT WHICH WE WANT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THAT WHICH NITE X. M. L. OFFERS US
AND THEN JUST SORT OF EVERYONE MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THE INTERFACE
SO I THINK IF TODAY WE DECIDE ON WHAT DATA WE WANNA HAVE NOW AND AND LATER MAYBE EVEN TODAY
WE GO AND LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. OR SOME OF US LOOK AT NITE X. M. L. IN A BIT MORE DETAIL
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THAT CODE AND SEE HOW DOES THE REPRESENTATION WORK IN THEIR SYSTEM
AND THEN SORT OF WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO THEN SAY OKAY THAT TYPE OF NITE X. M. L. DATA WE WANNA LOAD INTO IT
AND THIS IS HOW EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT AND THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO FROM THERE
NO
I'VE LOOKED LOOKED AT THE DOCUMENTATION AND N LIKE SEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK THAT WE WANT TO USE THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK BECAUSE UM THEY HAVE A GOOD A EVENT MODEL THAT SYNCHRONIZES SORT OF THE DATA AND AND EVERY DISPLAY ELEMENT
SO THAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK AWAY FROM US
SORT OF THAT WOULD BE A REASON FOR STAYING WITHIN THEIR FRAMEWORK AND USING THEIR GENERAL CLASSES
BUT BEYOND THAT I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT AT ALL WHICH IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY DO
WHO ACTUALLY LIKE FOR THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION I MEAN WHO OF US IS DOING STUFF THAT IS HAPPENING ON LINE AND WHO OF US IS DOING STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING OFF LINE
LIKE MY DATA IS COMING C
HMM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
'KAY
SO BASICALLY APART FROM THE DISPLAY MODULE THE I THE DISPLAY ITSELF
WE DON'T HAVE AN EXTREMELY HIGH DEGREE OF INTERACTION BETWEEN SORT OF OUR MODULES THAT CREATE THE STUFF AND AND THE INTERFACE
SO THE INTERFACE IS MAINLY WHILE IT'S RUNNING JUST WORKING ON DATA THAT'S JUST LOADED FROM A FILE I GUESS
THERE ISN'T
YEAH I KNOW
TH YEAH THE SEARCH IS I GUESS THE SEARCH IS SORT OF A STRANGE BEAST ANYWAY BECAUSE FOR THE SEARCH WE'RE LEAVING THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK
UM BUT THAT'S STILL SORT OF THAT'S GOOD
THAT MEANS THAT AT LEAST LIKE WE DON'T HAVE THE TYPE OF SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY HAS TO DO LIKE A BILLION CALCULATIONS ON ON DATA ON LINE
'CAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE LIKE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT OUR INTERFACE FOR THE DATA WOULD HAVE TO BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW IT PERFORMS AND AND EVERYTHING
AND NOBODY IS MODIFYING THAT DATA AT AT ON LINE TIME AT ALL IT SEEMS
NOBODY'S MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL DATA ON LINE
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY MAKING IT A LOT EASIER
THAT BASICALLY MEANS OUR BROWSER REALLY IS A VIEWER MOSTLY
WHICH ISN'T DOING MUCH WITH THE DATA EXCEPT FOR SORT OF SELECTING A PIECE PIECE OF IT AND AND DISPLAYING IT
HMM
WELL SOME PARTS RELEVANT FOR THE SEARCH YES
I'D SAY SO
HMM
YEAH BUT NOBODY OF US IS DOING MUCH OF SEARCHING FROM THE DATA IN THE ON LINE STAGE
AND FOR ALL TOGETHER LIKE THE DISPLAY ITSELF
I THINK WE ARE EASIER IF WE IF IT'S SITTING ON THE X. M. L. THAN IF IT'S SITTING ON THE S. Q. L. STUFF BECAUSE IF IT'S SITTING ON THE X. M. L.
WE HAVE THE THE NITE X. M. L. FRAMEWORK WITH ALL ITS FUNCTIONALITY FOR SYNCHRONIZING THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT LEVELS WHENEVER THERE'S A CHANGE WHENEVER SOMETHING'S MOVING FORWARD AND STUFF
AND WE CAN JUST MORE OR LESS LOOK AT THEIR CODE LIKE HOW THEIR PLAYER MOVES FORWARD
AND HOW THAT MOVING FORWARD IS REPRESENTED IN DIFFERENT WINDOWS AND STUFF
SO I THINK IN THE ACTUAL BROWSER ITSELF I DON'T WANNA SIT ON THE S. Q. L. IF WE CAN SIT ON THE X. M. L. BECAUSE SITTING ON THE X. M. L. WE HAVE ALL WE HAVE SO MUCH HELP
AND FOR Y FOR LIKE THE P THE CALCULATIONS THAT WE'RE DOING APART FROM THE SEARCH IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE NEEDS SOME SPECIAL REPRESENTATIONS ANYWAY
YOU MEAN OUR RESULTS
YEAH IN IN THE NITE X. M. L. X. M. L. FORMAT SO WITH THEIR TIME STAMPS AND STUFF SO THAT IT'S EASY TO TO TIE TOGETHER ST THINGS
WHAT I'M LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS IF WE GO WITH THIS MULTI LEVEL IDEA
LIKE THIS IDEA THAT SORT OF IF YOU START WITH A WHOLE MEETING SERIES AS ONE ENTITY AS ONE THING THAT YOU DISPLAY AS ONE WHOLE SORT OF
THAT THEN THE INDIVIDUAL CHUNKS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WHEREAS AND THEN YOU CAN CLICK ON A MEETING
AND THEN SORT OF THE MEETING IS THE WHOLE THING AND THE CHUNKS ARE THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS
THAT MEANS SORT OF WE HAVE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF OF REPRESENTATION WHICH WE PROBABLY
IF WE IF WE DO IT THIS WAY LIKE WE F WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT IF WE DO IT THIS WAY
THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY FIND SOME ABSTRACTION MODEL
SO THAT THE INTERFACE IN THE SENSE LIKE DEALS WITH IT AS IF IT'S SAME SO THAT THE INTERFACE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO WORRY WHETHER IT'S A MEETING IN THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES OR A SEGMENT WITHIN A MEETING
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AND THAT'S PROBABLY STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO SORT OF LIKE PROCESS TWICE THEN
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THAT LIKE THE SUMMARY OF A MEETING WITHIN THE WHOLE MEETING CORPUS OR MEETING SERIES Y IS MEETING SERIES A GOOD WORD FOR THAT
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HOW TO CALL IT
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE NOT NOT THE WHOLE CORPUS BUT EVERY MEETING THAT HAS TO DO WITH ONE TOPIC
UM SO IN IN THE MEETING SE SERIES SO THAT A SUMMARY FOR A MEETING WITHIN THE MEETING SERIES ARE SORT OF
COMPILED OFF LINE BY A SUMMARY MODULE
AND THAT IS SEPARATE FROM A SUMMARY OF A SEGMENT WITHIN A MEETING
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK WE CAN
SO ARE WE DOING THAT AT ALL LEVELS
ARE WE UM
AND JUST HAVE DIFFERENT LIKE FINE GRAINEDNESS LEVELS SORT OF
MM
'KAY
SO THE ONLY THING THAT YEAH SO THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN BASICALLY IF I DOUBLE CLICK LET'S SAY FROM THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES ON A SINGLE MEETING
IS THAT THE ZOOM LEVEL CHANGES
LIKE THE TH THE START AND THE END POSITION CHANGES AND THE ZOOM LEVEL CHANGES
I I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T DO THAT
LIKE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WE COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE COULDN'T LOAD THE DATA FOR ALL THAT
BUT I DON'T KNOW I MEAN THAT
SO I'M S NOT SURE IF I GOT IT
I WAS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO
OKAY
I WA I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE TOTAL MEMORY COMPLEXITY OF IT
BUT I I COMPLETELY ADMIT I MEAN I JUST SORT OF LIKE TH TOOK THAT FROM SOME THING THAT JONATHAN ONCE SAID ABOUT NOT LOADING EVERYTHING
BUT MAYBE I WAS JUST WRONG ABOUT IT
HOW MANY UTTERANCES W
YEAH AND I W YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHAT WE HAVE IS WE WOULD HAVE A WORD
LIKE WE WOULD HAVE WORDS WITH SOME PRIORITY LEVELS
AND THEY WOULD BASICALLY BE BECAUSE EVEN THE SELECTION WOULD WOULD THE SUMMARIES AUTOMATICALLY FEED FROM JUST HOW PRIORITIZED AN INDIVIDUAL WORD OR HOW INDIV UH PRIORITIZED AN INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCE IS
OR I ARE THE SUMMARIES SORT OF REFINED FROM IT AND MADE BY A MACHINE TO MAKE SENTENCES AND STUFF
OR ARE THEY JUST SORT OF TAKING OUT THE WORDS WITH THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AND THEN THE WORDS OF THE SECOND HIGHEST PRIORITY
AND THE U OKAY
ARE WE DOING IT ON TH THE WHOLE THING ON THE UTTERANCE LEVEL
OR ARE WE DOING IT ON WORD LEVEL LIKE THE INFORMATION DENSITY CALCULATION
WE I THINK WE HAVE START AND END TIMES FOR WORDS ACTUALLY BUT IT'S YEAH
BUT IT M IT MIGHT S BUT IT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY IN THE PLAYER
WE SHOULD REALLY MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT TOGETHER AT SOME POINT TODAY THAT WE CHECK OUT HOW THE PLAYER WORKS
BUT THERE'S MAYBE SOME MERIT IN ALTOGETHER DOING IT ON AN UTTERANCE LEVEL IN THE END
SO
YEAH
WELL BUT ALSO ABOUT THE DISPLAYS I MEAN THE DISPLAYS IN THE IN THE TEXT BODY
IN THE IN THE LATEST DRAFT THAT WE HAD SORT OF WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT IT ISN'T DISPLAYING UTTERANCE FOR UTTERANCE
BUT IT'S ALSO DISPLAYING UH A SUMMARISED VERSION IN YOU KNOW LIKE BELOW THE BELOW THE GRAPH THE PART
MAYBE
YEAH R
HMM
OH YEAH F IT'S JUST LIKE THERE THERE'S LIKE AUDIO SKIMMING AND THERE'S DISPLAYED SKIMMING
YEAH
MA MAYBE THERE'S SOME MERIT OF GOING ALTOGETHER FOR UTTERANCE LEVEL AND NOT EVEN BOTHER TO CALCULATE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT INTERNALLY
THEN YOU CAN DO IT
BUT MAYBE LIKE NOT EVEN STORE THE IMPORTANCE LEVELS FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS AND JUST SORT OF RANK UTTERANCES AS A WHOLE
HMM
YEAH
'CAUSE IT IT MIGHT BE BETTER SKIMMING AND LESS MEMORY REQUIRED AT THE SAME TIME
AND I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS THEN YOU CAN JUST IN THE WORST CASE
IF YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE JUST SORT OF MAKE THE MEAN OF THE WORDS OVER THE UTTERANCE
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
W IT'S IT'S
WELL WHAT'S THE SMALLEST CHUNK AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE THINKING OF OF ASSIGNING AN IMPORTANCE MEASURE TO IS IT A WORD OR IS IT AN UTTERANCE
SO WE'RE THINKING OF LIKE MAYBE JUST STORING IT ON A PER UTTERANCE LEVEL
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S LESS STUFF TO STORE PROBABLY FOR DAVE IN THE IN THE AUDIO PLAYING
AND FOR IN THE DISPLAY IT'S PROBABLY BETTER IF YOU HAVE WHOLE UTTERANCES THAN I DON'T KNOW
LIKE WHAT IT'S LIKE IF YOU JUST TAKE SINGLE WORDS OUT OF UTTERANCES
THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL WHEREAS IF YOU JUST UH SHOW IMPORTANT UTTERANCES BUT THE UTTERANCE AS A WHOLE IT MAKES MORE SENSE
SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR YOUR ALGORITHM 'CAUSE IT JUST MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE WORKING ON A WORD LEVEL
THEN WE JUST MEAN IT OVER THE UTTERANCE
THEY ARE ON
OH SO THAT'S GOOD ANYWAY THEN YEAH
BECAUSE THAT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER THAN TO T PUT IT ON UTTERANCE LEVEL
OH YEAH
NO BUT I MEAN LIKE HOW HOW JASMINE DOES IT INTERNALLY I DON'T KNOW
BUT IT'S PROBABLY YEAH YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK ON WORD LEVELS FOR IMPORTANCE
BUT THERE SHOULD BE WAYS OF EASILY GOING FROM A WORD LEVEL TO AN UTTERANCE LEVEL
OKAY
YEAH PROB
HMM
WELL WE DO A PRE FILTERING OF SORT OF THE WHOLE THING
SORT OF LIKE BUT THAT LIKE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IT'S EASY TO DO IN THE TEXT LEVEL
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN IT WOULD STILL PLAY THE UH IN YOUR AUDIO UNLESS WE SORT OF ALSO STORE WHAT PIECES WE CUT OUT FOR THE AUDIO
YEAH
I THINK BEFORE WE CAN LIKE ANSWER THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION HOW WE C DEAL WITH THAT
IT'S PROBABLY GOOD FOR US TO LOOK AT WHAT THE AUDIO PLAYER IS CAPABLE OF DOING
YES
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BUFFERING
LIKE YOU THINK DIRECTLY FEEDING
BUT YEAH BUT NOT BUT NOT STORED ON THE HARD DISK AND THEN LOADED IN BUT LOADED IN DIRECTLY FROM MEMORY
BUT IT'S PROBABLY A STREAM IF IT EXISTS IN JAVA IT WOULD BE PROBABLY SOME BINARY STREAM GOING IN OF SOME TYPE
OKAY YEAH
OKAY
OKAY SO I MEAN SO THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S PROBABLY EVEN IF YOU GO ON AN PER UTTERANCE LEVEL
THERE'S STILL SOME MERIT ON WITHIN UTTERANCES CUTTING OUT STUFF WHICH CLEARLY ISN'T RELEVANT AT ALL AND THAT MAYBE ALSO FOR THE AUDIO WE'D HAVE TO DO
SO LET'S SAY WE PLAY THE WHOLE AU PHRASE BUT THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT SAYS MINUS THAT PART OF SOMETHING
THAT'S OKAY THAT WE CAN DO
YEAH MAYBE EVEN I MEAN THAT'S SORT OF THAT DEPENDS ON HOW HOW ADVANCED WE GET
IF MAYBE IF WE REALISE THAT THERE'S MASSIVE DIFFERENCES IN IN GAIN OR IN SOMETHING
YOU CAN PROBABLY JUST MAKE SOME SIMPLE SIMPLE NORMALIZATION BUT THAT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE AND AND HOW MUCH IS NECESSARY
YEAH IF LIKE I D I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AUDIO AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PLAYER
SO IF YOU FIND THAT THE PLAYER ACCEPTS SOME N INPUT FROM MEMORY AND IF IT'S EASY TO DO THEN I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S FAIRLY DOABLE
SO BUT THAT MEANS IN THE GENERAL STRUCTURE WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE LUCKY
SO WE WE HAVE WE LOAD INTO MEMORY FOR THE WHOLE SERIES OF MEETINGS JUST THE UTTERANCES AND RANKINGS FOR THE UTTERANCES AND SOME INFORMATION PROBABLY THAT SAYS
WELL THE I GUESS THAT GOES WITH THE UTTERANCE WHO'S SPEAKING
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN ALSO DO THE DISPLAY ABOUT WHO'S SPEAKING
YEAH
BUT I'M I'M STILL CONFUSED 'CAUSE I THOUGHT LIKE THAT'S JUST WHAT JONATHAN SAID WE DO C THAT WE CAN'T DO LIKE LOAD A MASSIVE DOCUMENT OF THAT SIZE
ON THE OTHER HAND
THE OTHER HAND I MEAN IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE SHOULD BE LIKE FIFTY MEGA BYTE IN RAM OR SOMETHING IT SHOULDN'T BE MASSIVE SHOULD IT
ACTUALLY FIFTY HUNDRED MEGABYTE IS QUITE BIG IN RAM
JUST THINKING WHAT'S THE SIMP SO
WE DO GET AN ERROR MESSAGE WITH THE PROJECT IF WE LOAD EVERYTHING INTO THE PROJECT WITH ALL THE DATA THEY LOAD
SO WE KNOW THAT DOESN'T WORK
SO OUR HOPE IS ESSENTIALLY THAT WE LOAD LESS INTO IT
WHAT'S THIS LAZY LOADING THING SOMEBODY EXPLAIN LAZY LOADING TO ME
AH OKAY
SO THAT IS THAT ONLY BY TYPE OF FILE
LIKE IF IF IF THE SAME THING IS IN DIFFERENT FILES WOULD IT THEN MAYBE LIKE YOU KNOW
IF IF UTTERANCES ARE SPLIT OVER THREE OR TEN OR W HUNDRED DIFFERENT FILES
IS THEN A CHANCE MAYBE THAT IT DOESN'T TRY TO LOAD THEM ALL INTO MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME BUT JUST
SO WHY DOES IT FAIL THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE
THEN IT SHOULDN'T EVER FAIL BECAUSE THEN IT SHOULD NEVER
YEAH BUT YEAH BUT UM IT UH IT IT FAILED RIGHT WHEN YOU LOAD IT RIGHT THE NITE X. M. L. KIT SO THAT'S INTERESTING
HMM
LET'S CHECK THAT OUT
UM I'LL P I'LL PROBABLY ASK JONATHAN ABOUT IT
SO ALTERNATIVELY IF WE REALISE WE CAN'T DO THE WHOLE THING IN ONE GO
WE CAN PROBABLY JUST PROCESS SOME SORT OF META DATA YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE SORT OF SORT OF FOR THE WHOLE SERIES
CHUNKS REPRESENTING THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS OR SOME
LIKE SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS THE WHOLE SERIES IN IN A V IN A STRUCTURE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH WE REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL UM MEETINGS
BUT WITH DATA SORT OF ALWAYS COMBINED FROM THE WHOLE SERIES
SO INSTEAD OF HAVING AN SINGLE UTTERANCE THAT WE DISPLAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LIKE THAT WOULD BE REPRESENTING A WHOLE UM TOPIC A SEGMENT IN A MEETING
AND SORT OF SO THAT WI USING THE SAME DATA ST
WELL IN A SENSE
UH I'M I'M THINKING OF IN A SENSE OF LIKE CREATING A VIRTUAL A VIRTUAL MEETING OUT OF THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES SORT OF
YEAH SORT OF LIKE OFF LINE CREATE A VIRTUAL MEETING WHICH WHICH BASICALLY TREATS THE MEETING SERIES AS IF IT WAS A MEETING
AND TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITHIN THE SERIES AS IF THEY WERE SEGMENTS AND TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS WITHIN MEETINGS AS IF THEY WERE UM UTTERANCES
YOU KNOW SO WE JUST SORT OF WE SHIFT IT ONE LEVEL UP
AND IN THAT WAY WE COULD PROBABLY USE THE SAME ALGORITHM AND JUST LIKE MAKE VIR LIKE ONE OR TWO IFS THAT SAY OKAY
IF YOU ARE ON A WHOLE DOCUMENT UH A WHOLE SERIES LEVEL AND THAT WAS A DOUBLE CLICK
THEN DON'T JUST GO INTO THAT UM SEGMENT BUT LOAD A NEW FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT BUT IN GENERAL USE THE SAME ALGORITHM
THAT WOULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE IF WE CAN'T ACTUALLY LOAD THE WHOLE THING AND
'CAUSE ALSO LIKE EVEN IF WE MAYBE THIS WHOLE LIKE MAYBE I'M WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE WHOLE SERIES IN ONE THING DISPLAY
BECAUSE ACTUALLY I MEAN PROBABLY USERS WOULDN'T VIEW THAT ONE TOO OFTEN
YEAH BUT I'M I'M STILL WORRIED
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE DISPLAY IF YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT A DISPLAY UH LIKE FOR THE WHOLE SERIES
THE INFORMATION DENSITY LEVELS BASED ON AND AND THE F AND THE ONLY GRANULARITY YOU HAVE IS INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE UTTERANCE IN A SERIES OF SEVENTY HOURS OF MEETINGS
YEAH
YEAH AND IF YOU MAKE THAT STRUCTURALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE THE LE LIKE ONE LEVEL DOWN
LIKE THE WAY HOW WE UH STORE INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES AND STUFF
THEN MAYBE WE CAN MORE OR LESS USE THE SAME CODE AND JUST MAKE A FEW IFS AND STUFF
YEAH SO SO BUT STILL SO IN IN GENERAL WE'RE HAVING WE'RE HAVING UTTERANCES
AND THEY HAVE A SCORE
AND THAT'S AS MUCH AS WE REALLY NEED
AND OF COU AND THEY ALSO HAVE A TIME A TIME INFORMATION OF COURSE
HMM
AND A AND A S AND A SPEAKER INFORMATION YEAH
YEAH SO AN INFORMATION WHICH TOPIC THEY'RE IN YEAH
AND AND PROBABLY SEPARATE TO THAT AN INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TOPICS LIKE THAT
YEAH
SO
SO THE SKIMMING CAN WORK ON THAT BECAUSE THE SKIMMING JUST SORT OF SORTS THE UTTERANCES AND PUTS AS MANY IN AS IT NEEDS
YEAH
YEAH IT'LL IT'LL PLAY THEM IN SOME ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE SET BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S GONNA BE MORE ENTERTAINING
UM
BUT THAT THAT'S ENOUGH DATA FOR THE SKIMMING AND THE THE SEARCHING SO WHAT THE SEARCHING DOES IS THE SEARCHING LEAVES THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK
GOES TO THE S. Q. L. DATABASE AND GETS LIKE BASICALLY IN THE END GETS JUST A TIME MARKER FOR WHERE THAT IS LIKE THAT UTTERANCE THAT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH
AND THEN WE HAVE TO FIND I'M SURE THERE'S SOME WAY IN IN NITE X. M. L. TO JUST SAY SET POSITION TO THAT TIME MARK
AND THEN IT SHIFTS THE WHOLE FRAME AND IT ALERTS EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF THE DISPLAY AND THE DISPLAY UPDATES
YEAH YEAH
THAT WE CAN JU YEAH BUT SO SO IF IF SOMETHI SO YEAH
SO IF IN THAT TREE DISPLAY SOMEBODY CLICKS ON SOMETHING
YEAH AND THEN YOU SORT OF FEED THE TIME STAMP TO AND THE NITE X. M. L. CENTRAL MANAGER
AND THAT CENTRAL MANAGER ALERTS EVERYTHING THAT'S THERE LIKE ALERTS THE SKIM LIKE THE THE AUDIO DISPLAY
ALERTS THE TEXT DISPLAY
ALERTS THE VISUAL DISPLAY AND SAYS WE HAVE A NEW TIME FRAME AND THEN THEY ALL SORT OF DO THEIR UPDATE ROUTINES WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT LEVEL OF ZOOM
SO HOW MUCH DO THEY DISPLAY AND STARTING POSITION AT WHERE THE OR MAYBE THE MID POSITION OF IT
I DON'T KNOW LIKE W IF START WHERE THE THING WAS FOUND OR IF THAT THING WA WAS FOUND IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PART THAT WE DISPLAY
THAT I DON'T KNOW
BUT THAT WE CAN DECIDE ABOUT BUT A GENERAL SORT OF
IT'S THE SAME THING IF LIKE WHETHER YOU PLAY AND IT MOVES FORWARD OR WHETHER YOU JUMP TO A POSITION THROUGH SEARCH
IT'S ESSENTIALLY FOR ALL THE WINDOW HANDLING IT'S THE SAME EVENT
IT'S ONLY THAT THE EVENT GETS TRIGGERED BY THE SEARCH ROUTINE WHICH SORT OF PUSH THAT INTO NITE X. M. L. AND SAYS PLEASE GO THERE NOW
WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO IT IN MEMORY
BUT THAT STUFF'S SO
I MEAN LIKE THE INFORMATION IS COMING FROM OFF LINE
SO WE PROBABLY WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CHANGE THE UTTERANCE DOCUMENT
RIGHT BECAUSE THE WHOLE WAY LIKE THE WHOLE BEAUTY OF THE NITE X. M. L. IS THAT IT TIES TOGETHER LOTS OF DIFFERENT FILES
SO WE CAN JUST CREATE AN ADDITIONAL X. M. L. FILE WHICH FOR EVERY UTTERANCE LIKE THE UTTERANCES HAVE I. D. S I PRESUME SOME REFERENCES
SO WE JUST WE TIE UH P JUST A VERY SHORT X. M. L. FILE
WHICH IT'S THE ONLY INFORMATION IT HAS THAT HAS WHATEVER A NUMBER FOR FOR THE UM WEIGHT
FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY AND WE JUST TIE THAT TO THE EXISTING UTTERANCES AND TIE THEM TO THE EXISTING SPEAKER CHANGES
WELL OTHERWISE WE PROBABLY HAVE TO GO OVER IT AND LIKE ADD SOME INTEGER THAT WE JUST INCREMENT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SORT OF TO EVERY UTTERANCE AS AN AS AN I. D. SOME TYPE
OR UN OR TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW NITE X. M. L. I. D. S WORK AND MAYBE THERE'S SOME SPECIAL ROUTE WE HAVE TO FOLLOW WHEN WE USE THESE I. D. S
IT'S ALM HMM
YEAH THE THE GIRL SAID THE UTTERANCES THEMSELVES ARE NOT NUMBERED AT THE MOMENT
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
SO I GUESS THAT WOULD BE SOLVABLE IF NOT
MM-HMM
SORRY
OKAY
OKAY
IS THAT A BOARD MARKER PEN ACTUALLY
OH
THAT'S JUST SO LIKE TO MAKE A LIST OF ALL THIS STUFF OR WE PROBABLY CAN SOMEBODY CAN DO IT ON PAPER
ALL THESE FANCY PENS
SO WHAT SO THE STUFF WE HAVE WE HAVE UTTERANCES AND SPEAKERS AND WEIGHTS FOR UTTERANCES
SO FOR FOR EVERY UTTERANCE SORT OF LIKE THE UTTERANCE HAS A SPEAKER AND A WEIGHT WHICH IS COMING FROM OUTSIDE
OR WE JUST TIE IT TO IT
AND THERE IS SEGMENTS WHICH HMM
OH SO SORRY UM
UH TOPIC S TOPIC SEGMENTS I MEANT
LIKE THEY ARE THEY ARE A SUPER UNIT
SO SO THE UTTERANCES ARE TIED TO TOPIC SEGMENTS
AND IF THE TIME STAMPS ARE ON A WORD LEVEL THEN WE B SOMEHOW HAVE TO EXTRACT TIME STAMPS FOR UTTERANCES WHERE THEY START
W WHAT SEGMENTS NOW
OKAY
IS THE UH IS THAT THE SAME AS UTTERANCES THAT IS THAT THE SAME AS UTTERANCES THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WHAT SO THAT'S OH
BUT THAT'S ONE O ONE SEGMENT OR IS THAT TWO SEGMENTS THEN
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO BUT BUT GENERALLY UTTERANCES IS THAT WHICH WE JUST CALLED UH SORRY SEGMENTS IS THAT WHICH WE JUST CALLED UTTERANCES NOW
LIKE IT'S IT'S THE SA IT'S SORT OF LIKE ONE PERSON'S CONTRIBUTION AT A TIME SORT OF THINGY DINGY
OKAY SO YEAH SO WE HAVE THOSE AND AND THEN WE HAVE SOME F FIELD SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH HAS
TOPICS
YEAH AND AND A TOPIC'S BASICALLY THEY ARE JUST ON THE I. D. PROBABLY WITH A START TIME OR SOMETHING
AND AND THE UTTERANCES REFERENCED TO THOSE TOPICS I GUESS
SO THE TOPICS DON'T CONTAIN ANY REDUNDANT THING OF LIKE SHOWING THE WHOLE TOPIC AGAIN
BUT THEY JUST SORT OF SAY A NUMBER AND WHERE THEY START AND WHERE THEY FINISH
AND THE UTTERANCES THEN SAY WHICH TOPIC THEY BELONG TO
YEAH
NO
BUT I WAS THINKING OF THE TOPIC SEGMENTATION NOW AND AND F FOR THAT THERE WOULD ONLY BE ONE
RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF LIKE IT'S JUST A TIME WINDOW
YEAH
SO IF THIS LAZY LOADING WORKS THEN THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY FIT INTO I MEAN NOT MEMORY THEN BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T ALL BE IN MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME
SO IF WE JUST HAVE THOSE SORT OF THAT INFORMATION LIKE A LONG LIST OF ALL THE UTTERANCES SLASH SEGMENTS AND LIKE SHORT OR SMALLER LISTS WHICH GIVE WEIGHT TO THEM
AND EVEN THOUGH PROBABLY IF THERE'S A LOT OF OVER HEAD IN HAVING TWO DIFFERENT FILES WE CAN PROBABLY MERGE THE WEIGHTS INTO IT OFF LINE
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
LIKE IF IF THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRACY INVOLVED WITH HAVING TWO DIFFERENT TREES AND WHETHER ONE TIES TO THE OTHER BECAUSE THE ONE HAS THE WEIGHT FOR THE OTHER
THEN IT'S PROBABLY QUICKER TO JUST
YEAH
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WHOLE BEAUTY THAT LIKE YOU CAN JUST MAKE A NEW X. M. L. FILE AND SORT OF TIE THAT TO THE OTHER AND AND IT TRE
OH YEAH
SO NO I DIDN'T I DIDN'T MEAN TREE
NO
NO
I MEANT JUST LIKE HANDLING TWO DIFFERENT FILES INTERNALLY
SORT OF C I WAS JUST THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE IF IF THE OVERHEAD FOR HAVING THE SAME AMOUNT OF DATA COMING FROM TWO D FILES INSTEAD OF FROM ONE FILE IS MASSIVE
THEN IT WOULD PROBABLY BE FOR US EASY TO JUST LIKE OFF LINE PUT THE THE WEIGHT INTO INTO THE FILE THAT HAS THE SEGMENTS
UH YEAH SEGMENTS SLASH UTTERANCES ALREADY
BUT THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT I MEAN IF IT'S GOING HORRENDOUSLY WRONG
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH NO
WE'D WE'D BE COMPLETELY USING LIKE THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND BASICALLY JUST I MEAN THE MAIN DIFFERENCE REALLY BETWEEN OUR PROJECT AND THEIRS REALLY IS THAT WE LOAD A DIFFERENT PART OF THE DATA
BUT OTHERWISE WE'RE DOING IT THE SAME WAY THAT THEY ARE DOING IT
SO WE JUST WE'RE SORT OF RUNNING DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUERIES ON IT
WE IN A SENSE WE I THINK WE ARE RUNNING QUERIES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT UM WHAT WE LOAD AND WHAT WE DON'T LOAD
BUT WE'RE L RUNNING QUERIES IN THE SENSE THAT WE DYNAMICALLY SELECT BY BY WEIGHTS DON'T WE
THAT WE HAVE TO CHECK HOW FAST THAT IS LIKE TO SAY GIVE US ALL THE ONES THAT WHETHER THAT WORKS WITH THEIR QUERY LANGUAGE
WHETHER THAT'S TOO MANY RESULTS AND WHETHER WE SHOU
YOU KNOW
IF 'CAUSE IF IT I LET'S SAY I MEAN IF IF THEIR QUERY LANGUAGE IS STRANGE AND IF IT WOULD RETURN B TEN MILLION RESULTS AND IT CAN'T HANDLE IT
THEN WE CAN JUST WRITE OUR INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS IN THE WAY THAT THEY KNOW WHICH WHAT THE THRESHOLD IS
SO THEY STILL GET ALL THE DATA AND JUST THEY INTERNALLY SAY OH NO THIS IS LESS THAN THREE AND I'M NOT GONNA DISPLAY IT OR SOMETHING
HMM
YEAH
NO
I'M JUST THINKING FOR THIS WHOLE THING OF LIKE A DIFFERENT LEVEL SORT OF CUTTING OUT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PIECES
WHETHER WE DO THAT THROUGH A QUERY WHERE WE SAY GIVE US EVERYTHING THAT'S AB ABOVE THIS AND THIS WEIGHT OR WHETHER WE SKIP THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE
BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL MODULE LIKE THE PLAYER AND THE DISPLAY SAY LIKE THEY STILL GET SORT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT UTTERANCES
UH ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES BUT THEY SAY OH THIS PIECE I LEAVE OUT BECAUSE IT'S BELOW THE CURRENT THRESHOLD LEVEL
WHEN DO WE NEED THE ONE FOR THE MEET
OKAY
YEAH I GUESS FOR THE SO WHEN WE HAVE THE DISPLAY WILL WE DISPLAY THE WHOLE SERIES
THEN IF WE HAVE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TOPIC SEGMENTS WITHIN THE MEETINGS IF WE HAVE READY CALCULATED DISP UM MEASURES
THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO SORT OF EXTRACT THAT DATA FROM THE INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES
YEAH AND THAT'S ALSO FAIRLY EASY TO STORE ALONG WITH OUR SEGMENTS ISN'T IT
FOR THE SEGMENTS
ARE WE EXTRACTING SOME TYPE OF TITLE FOR THEM THAT WE CRAFT WITH SOME FANCY ALGORITHM OR MANUALLY OR WE'RE JUST TAKING THE SINGLE MOST HIGHLY VALUED KEY WORD UTTERANCE FOR THE SEGMENT HEADING
HMM
HMM
IT'S PROBABLY LIKE IN IN THE END PROBABLY IT WOULDN'T BE THE BEST THING IF IT'S JUST THE HIGH MOST HIGHLY RANKED PHRASE OR KEY WORD BECAUSE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR AN INTRODUCTION THAT WOULD MOST DEFINITELY NOT BE ANYTHING THAT HAS ANY TITLE ANYWHERE SIMILAR TO INTRODUCTION OR SOMETHING
YEAH
ALSO LIKE FOR THIS PART MAYBE IF WE GO OVER IT WITH NAMED ENTITY IN THE END
IF I MEAN W IF ONE OF THE PEOPLE DOING DIL HAS SOME NAMED ENTITY CODE TO SPARE
AND JUST LIKE AT LEAST FOR THE FOR SORT OF FOR FINDING TOPICS TITLES FOR FOR SEGMENTS
JUST TAKE A NAMED ENTITY WHICH HAS A REALLY HIGH WHAT'S IT CALLED D. F. I. D. F. WHATEVER
'CAUSE YOU'D PROBABLY BE QUITE LIKELY IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A CONFERENCE OR A PERSON
THAT THAT WOULD BE A NAMED ENTITY WHICH IS VERY HIGHLY FR UM FREQUENTED IN THAT PART
YEAH HE SAID THEY'RE QUITE SPARSE
SO THAT BASICALLY WAS DON'T BOTHER BASING TOO MUCH OF YOUR GENERAL CALCULATION ON IT
BUT LIKE ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE SPARSE PROBABLY INDIVIDUAL NAMED ENTITIES WHICH DESCRIBE WHAT A WHAT A SEGMENT IS ABOUT WOULD PROBABLY BE QUITE GOOD
LIKE IF THERE'S SOME NAME OF SOME CONFERENCE THEY WOULD COULD PROBABLY SAY THAT NAME OF THE CONFERENCE QUITE OFTEN
EVEN THOUGH HE'S RIGHT THAT THEY MAKE INDIRECT REFERENCES TO IT
ANYWAY SORRY
SO YOU'RE DOING THAT ON A ON A PER WORD LEVEL
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY COOL
I WAS JUST WONDERING WHERE YOU HAD THE CORPUS FROM AT THE MOMENT
SO IT IT SEEMS THAT THE DATA STRUCTURE ISN'T A BIG PROBLEM AND THAT BASICALLY WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ALL THESE MASSIVE DISCUSSIONS OF HOW WE EXACTLY INTERACT WITH THE DATA STRUCTURE BECAUSE MOST OF OUR WORK ISN'T DONE WITH THAT DATA STRUCTURE IN MEMORY IN THE BROWSER
BUT IT'S JUST DONE OFF LINE AND EVERYONE CAN HA REPRESENT IT ANYWAY THEY WANT AS LONG AS THEY SORT OF STORE IT IN A USEFUL X. M. L. REPRESENTATION IN THE END
SO LIKE
YEAH THAT WOULD MEAN UNDERSTANDING THE NITE X. M. L. X. M. L. SORT OF FORMAT IN A LOT MORE DETAIL
WE SHOULD I THINK WE SHOULD JUST HAVE A LONG SESSION IN THE COMPUTER ROOM TOGETHER AND LIKE NOW THAT WE KNOW A BIT MORE WHAT WE WANT
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT NITE X. M. L.
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
GOOD
YEAH I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THIS STUFF MUCH AT ALL
YEAH
YEAH
WHO'S WHO'S SORT OF DOING THE THE THE CENTRAL COORDINATION OF OF OF THE BROWSER APPLICATION NOW
LIKE
HMM
YEAH OR BUT ALSO LIKE ALL THESE ELEMENTS LIKE LIKE THE LOADING AND YEAH INTEGRATION AND AND LIKE HANDLING THE DATA LOADING AND STUFF
NAH
I'M SORT OF LIKE I THINK I'LL TAKE OVER THE DISPLAY JUST BECAUSE I'VE STARTED WITH A BIT AND FOUND IT FOUND IT DOABLE
SO SOMEBODY SHOULD SORT OF BE THE ONE PERSON WHO'S WHO UNDERSTANDS MOST ABOUT WHAT'S T CENTRALLY GOING ON WITH WITH THE WITH THE PROJECT
LIKE WITH THE WITH THE BROWSER AS A WHOLE AND WHERE THE DATA COMES IN AND
ANY VOLUNTEERS
IT'S ALSO A COMPLICATED ONE
YEAH
I KNOW BUT UH B I GUESS WE CAN DO IT LIKE SEVERAL PEOPLE TOGETHER
IT'S PROBABLY JUST THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER A LOT AND VERY CLOSELY AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS F UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OTHER ONE IS DOING
YEAH OR OR READY MADE VERSIONS OF THEM FOR THAT MATTER AND
YEAH BUT I THINK ACTUALLY LIKE AT THE MOMENT THE INTEGRATION COMES FIRST I MEAN IT'S SORT OF AT THE MOMENT THE BUILDING THE BROWSER COMES FIRST
AND THEN ONLY COMES THE CREATING NEW SOPHISTICATED DATA CHUNKS
BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF THE WHOLE THING ABOUT HAVING A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WHICH IS MORE OR LESS WORKING ON ON CHUNK DATA
BUT IT AT LEAST WE HAVE THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH WE CAN THEN TEST EVERYTHING AND AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING
'CAUSE BEFORE WE HAVE THAT
IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO REALLY SEE HOW MUCH THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IS MAKING SENSE BECAUSE YOU JUST WELL I GUESS YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING FROM THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL X. M. L. S FILES FILES THAT YOU CREATE
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME BASIC SYSTEM WHICH JUST DISPLAYS SOME STUFF
OR JUST ADAPT LIKE THEIR LIKE JUST SORT OF GO FROM THEIR SYSTEM AND AND ADAPT THAT PIECE FOR PIECE AND SEE HOW WE COULD
HOW WE COULD ARRAN LIKE ADAPT IT TO OUR
SYSTEM
DOES ANYONE WANT TO LIKE JUST SIT WITH ME AND LIKE PLAY FOR THREE HOURS WITH NITE X. M. L. AT SOME POINT
UH I WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE 'CAUSE I'D LIKE TO GO TO THE GYM
I'M THEORETICALLY FREE
BUT IF THERE'S ANY TIME T HMM
YOU HAVE NOTHING NO FREE TIME ON WEDNESDAY
HMM
NINE 'TIL TWELVE AND THEN NOTHI YOU HAVE OR YOU
HMM
ANYTIME WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON I'D BE COOL I THINK
YO FORREST HILL WHATEVER ONE'S EASIER TO DISCUSS STUFF I DON'T KNOW
I'M NOT BIASED
OKAY
WHAT TIME DO YOU WANNA DO
OKAY SO I'LL JUST MEET YOU IN IN EIGHTEEN A IN THE AFTERNOON
I GUESS AT THE MOMENT NOBODY CRITICALLY DEPENDS ON LIKE THE NITE X. M. L. STUFF WORKING RIGHT NOW RIGHT
LIKE AT THE MOMENT YOU CAN ALL DO YOUR STUFF AND I CAN DO MY L. S. A. STUFF
AND I CAN EVEN DO THE DISPLAY TO A VAST DEGREE WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THEIR SUPPLYING FRAMEWORK WORKING
SO IT'S NOT THAT CRUCIAL
YEAH ACTUALLY I NEED THE RAW TEXT AS WELL
YEAH BUT I WAS I WAS I WAS MORE THINKING OF THE SORT OF THE THE WHOLE BROWSER FRAMEWORK AS A RUNNING PROGRAMME NOW
YEAH I THINK WE ALL NEED THE RAW TEXT IN DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS DON'T WE
BUT NUMBER WITHIN THE X. M. L. CONTEXT
ARE THEY SPOKEN NUMBERS
LIKE DO THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE UTTERANCES NUMBERS
THERE'S THE NUMBER TASK ISN'T THERE
THAT'S PART OF THE WHOLE THING
HMM
OKAY
HMM
YEAH WE HAVE TO PROBABLY CUT THAT OUT ANYWAY FOR OUR PROJECT I DON'T KNOW
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA SCREW UP A LOT OF OUR DATA OTHERWISE
IF NOT SURE IF IT WHAT IT DOES TO DOCUMENT IT WOULD PROBABLY MAKE THE YEAH IF IF YOU HAVE SEGMENTS FOR THAT PROBABLY THE
OKAY
UH I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IT PRO IT PRO PROBABLY LIKE THE L. S. A. WOULD PERFORM QUITE WELL ON IT
IT WOULD PROBABLY FIND ANOTHER NUMBER TASK QUITE EASILY SEEING THAT IT'S A CONSTRAINED VOCABULARY WITH A HIGH CO OCCURRENCE OF THE SAME NINE WORDS
SO THAT WOU TEN WORD
HMM
YEAH
I THINK IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT THEY THEY SAID THE NUMBERS IN ORDER RIGHT
YEAH I THINK IT'S IT THE IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WANTED TO CHECK OUT HOW WELL THEY WERE DOING WITH OVERLAPPING AND STUFF
BECAUSE BASICALLY IT'S LIKE THEY'RE READING THEM AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS BUT YOU KNOW IN WHICH ORDER THEY ARE SAID
ANYWAY
ICSI HAS SOME REASONS FOR DOING IT
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN PISSED OFF SAYING LIKE NUMBERS AT THE END OF EVERY MEETING
UM DAVE IF YOU WOULD OR ACTUALLY FOR WELL IF YOU'RE DOING I. D. F. S OR YOU WHATEVER YOU CALL YOUR YOUR FREQUENCIES I ALWAYS MIX UP THE NAME
UH YOU NEED SOME DICTIONARY FOR THAT AT SOME POINT THOUGH
LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME REPRESENTATION OF A WORD AS NOT NOT THAT SPECIFIC OCCURRENCE OF THAT WORD TOKEN BUT OF OF OF A GIVEN WORD FORM
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING COUNTS FOR WORD FORMS RIGHT
YEAH SO WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THAT BECAUSE I NEED A DICTIONARY AS WELL
OKAY
'KAY
OKAY
DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE O THE ORD
YEAH BUT FOR I'M JUST WONDERING FOR THE WHOLE THING
DOES SOMEBODY WO WHO WAS IT OF YOU TWO WHO SAID THAT UM THERE'S SOME PROGRAMME WHICH SPITS OUT A DICTIONARY PROBABLY WITH FREQUENCIES
OKAY
IS ANYONE OF YOU FOR THE FOR THE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY OVER TOTAL FREQUENCY YOU GONNA HAVE TOTAL FREQUENCIES OF WORDS THEN WITH THAT RIGHT
LIKE OVER THE WHOLE CORPUS SORT OF
OR
W USING WHICH TOOL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT
LIKE MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS WAS THAT THERE'S FAR MORE WORD TYPES THAN YOU EVER THINK BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT'S SORT OF UNUSUAL GENERALLY IS A NEW WORD TYPE
LIKE ANY TYPO OR ANY STRANGE THING WHERE THEY PUT TWO WORDS TOGETHER
AND ALSO ANY NUMBER AS A WORD TYPE OF ITS OWN
SO YOU CAN EASILY END UP WITH HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF WORDS WHEN YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THEM
SO GENERALLY DICTIONARIES CAN GROW BIGGER THEN YOU THINK THEY DO
WELL YOU CAN PROBABLY ALSO YOU CAN PROBABLY PRE FILTER LIKE WITH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS EVEN JUST SAY IF IT CONSISTS OF ONLY DIG DIGITS THEN SKIP IT
OR EVEN IF IT CONSISTS ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS
THEN SKIP IT BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WITH A DOT IN BETWEEN WHICH IS USUALLY NOT SOMETHING YOU WANNA HAVE AND
WHAT I DID FOR MY PROJECT I JUST IGNORED THE HUNDRED MOST FREQUENT WORDS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY END UP ALL BEING ARTICLES AND AND EVERYTHING AND STUFF
SO WE NEED LIKE SEVERAL OF US NEED A DICTIONARY
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS IT WITH FREQUENCIES
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS IT WITH FREQUENCIES
OR
FREQUENCIES
YEAH
WELL I GUESS AS SOON AS WE HAVE THE RAW TEXT
WE CAN PROBABLY JUST START WITH THE JAVA HASH MAP AND LIKE JUST HASH MAP OVER IT AND SEE HOW FAR WE GET
I MEAN WE CAN PROBABLY ON A MACHINE WITH A FEW HUNDRED MEGABYTE RAM YOU CAN GO QUITE FAR
YOU CAN WRITE IT ON BEEFY
SO EVEN IF IT GOES WRONG AND EVEN IF IT HAS A MILLION WORDS BE
OH YEAH BURNING IT ON A LIKE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BURN THE WHOLE CORPUS JUST THE X. HMM
AH I SEE I ASKED SUPPORT ABOUT THAT TWO DAYS AGO
IN THE INFORMATICS BUILDING THERE OH SORRY IN IN APPLETON TOWER FIVE THE ONES CLOSEST T TWO MACHINES CLOSEST TO THE SUPPORT OFFICE
SO I PRESUME OH WAIT I HAVE THE EXACT EMAIL
I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT SORT OF THE ONES THAT
YEAH IF YOU IF YOU ENTER THE BIG ROOM IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER I THINK
UM THE THING IS LIKE YOU CAN ONLY BURN FROM THE LOCAL FILE SYSTEM
SO IF IT'S FROM S WELL ACTUALLY I THINK IF IT'S MOUNTED YOU CAN DIRECTLY BURN FROM THERE
BUT THE PROBLEM IS I HAVE MY DATA ON BEEFY AND SO I HAVE TO GET IT INTO THE LOCAL TEMP DIRECTORY AND BURN IT FROM THERE
BUT YOU CAN BURN IT FROM THERE
UH WE LOOKED THAT UP AND I FOR WE LOOKED THAT UP AND I FORGOT
YEAH YEAH
NO YOU YOU WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT AT I DON'T THINK IT WAS I DON'T THINK IT WAS A GIGABYTE
HMM
SEE I WOULD OFF I WOULD OFFER YOU TO TO GET IT ON THIS ONE AND THEN UM LIKE COPY IT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I FIGURED OUT I'M QUICKER DOWN LOADING OVER BROAD BAND INTO MY COMPUTER THAN USING THIS HARD DISK
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THE WAY HOW THEY ACCESS THE HARD DISK HOW THEY MOUNT IT WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE
HMM
WHAT OPERATING SYSTEM DO YOU HAVE
OKAY
WH WHAT CONNECTION DO YOU HAVE AT HOME
YEAH
SO IF ANYONE OF US GETS IT WE CAN THEN JUST USE AN EXT HMM
YEAH BURN IT TO C. D. OR YEAH PUT IT ON ON HARD DISK WHATEVER
QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE NOT QUICKER IF YOU UH BECAUSE YOU SHOULD GET MASSIVE COMPRESSION OUT OF THAT
LIKE FIFTY PERCENT OR SOMETHING WITH A GOOD ALGORITHM
SO IF YOU COULD COMPRESS IT AND JUST PUT IT INTO A TEMP DIRECTORY
LIKE
THE TEMP THE TEMPS USUALLY HAVE FOR GIGABYTE THREE OR TWO
THE TEMPS YEAH
I DO LIKE I MEAN THERE'S NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANYTHING STAYS THERE BUT OVERNIGHT IT'LL STAY
AND I THINK THE TEMPS USUALLY HAVE
AH YEAH BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE TEMP DIRECTORY OFF THE MACHINE YOU CAN S. S. H. INTO DIRECTORY OF S. S. H.
YEAH THEY WOU THEY'D THEY'D PROBABLY HATE YOU FOR DOING IT
BUT
THEY'D PROBABLY THEY'D LIKE YOU MORE IF YOU S. S. H. UH INTO ANOTHER COMPUTER COMPRESS IT THERE AND THEN SORT OF COPY IT INTO THE INTO THE GATEWAY MACHINE
THEY HAVE UM IF YOU S. S. HEY YOU KNOW
IF YOU IF YOU S. S. H. AND THEY HAVE THIS BIG WARNING ABOUT DOING NOTHING AT ALL IN THE GATEWAY MACHINE
YEAH
TO YOUR HOME MACHINE
I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO TUNNEL THROUGH THE GATEWAY INTO ANOTHER MACHINE YET
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EASY DEFINITELY
THAT'S WHY I END UP SORT OF COPYING STUFF INTO THE TEMP DIRECTORY AT THE GATEWAY MACHINE
SORRY IF THIS IS BORING EVERYBODY ELSE
THIS IS JUST DETAILS AND HOW TO GET STUFF HOME FROM WHAT WE CAN PROBABLY JUST LOOK AT THAT TOGETHER WHEN WE'RE MEETING
I'M SORRY
MM-HMM
WELL YEAH
AS SOON AS SOMEBODY GIVES ME THE RAW TEXT OF THE WHOLE THING
I CAN PROBABLY JUST IMPLEMENT LIKE A FIVE LINE JAVA HASH TABLE FREQUENCY DICTIONARY BUILDER AND SEE
OH DID YOU NOT SAY FREQUENCIES F OF WORDS IN THE WHOLE SORRY DID UH
SO YOU'D YOU
YEAH YOU'D HAVE TO COUNT IT YOURSELF YEAH
OH YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE DIFFERENT COUNTS FOR EACH CHUNK BUT JUST LIKE SORT OF FOR FOR SOMETHING FROM OLD CHUNKS
OH YEAH NO THAT'S YEAH
SO ONCE I WRITE AN AR LIKE W IF I WRITE LIKE AN ALGORITHM WHICH DOES A HASH UM TABLE DICTIONARY WITH FREQUENCY FROM A RAW TEXT
THEN THE RAW TEXT CAN BE ANYTHING
SO HOW FAR ARE WE G UH HOW F HOW FAR ARE YOU GETTING RAW TEXT OUT OF IT DO YOU THINK
OKAY WELL THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE FOR THE DICTIONARY THE ORDER DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE DOES IT
SO YEAH SO UM I'LL GET THAT FROM YOU AND I'LL WRITE THE HASH TABLE WHICH GOES OVER THAT AND CREATES A DICTIONARY FILE
SO FOR THE DICTIONARY IS IT OKAY IF I DO WHATEVER WORD BLANK FREQUENCY OR SOMETHING
JUST P COULD EVERYBODY SORT OF START FROM THAT
I MEAN I GUESS WE CAN
YEAH I I NEED FREQUENCY AS WELL
WELL I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WHAT WE CALCULATE BECAUSE I FOR MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS NEED LIKE COUNTS OF WORDS WITHIN A DOCUMENT
UH WITHIN A A SEGMENT ACTUALLY WITHIN A TOPIC SEGMENT
CAN I CONVERT THESE PROBABILITIES BACK INTO FREQUENCIES
OKAY
OH SO THAT'S WHAT F RAINBOW DOES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT L. S. A. BUILDS ON
LIKE IT BUILDS A F A DOCUMENT BY FREQUENCY MATRIX
SO I COULD PROBABLY GET THAT
EVEN THOUGH BUT I ALREADY HAVE I ALREADY HAVE MY CODE TO BUILD IT UP MYSELF
NO DON'T BOTHER
I HAVE MY CODE ALREADY
UM
YEAH SO DAVE YOU SAID YOU NEED THE FREQUENCY COUNTS ACTUALLY FOR PER DOCUMENT WOULD YOU SAY NOT FOR THE WHOLE THING
IT MORE AND MORE APPEARS TO ME THAT IF WE IF WE SCRAP THE NOTION OF THE MEETING AS AN INDIVIDUAL THING AND SORT OF JU SEE MEETINGS AS AS TOPIC SEGMENTS AND HAVE SORT OF LIKE HIERARCHICAL TOPIC SEGMENTATION INSTEAD
THEN IT'S B LIKE A MORE COHERENT FRAMEWORK
WAIT ARE WE ARE WE USING THIS UM FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE DO FOR THE WEIGHTING IN THE END NOW THIS THIS MEASURE YOU'RE CALCULATING
BECAUSE IF WE'RE DOING LIKE I THINK FOR FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY WE UH WE SHOULD CALCULATE IT ON THE LOWEST LEVEL NOT ON THE HIGHEST
BUT LIKE 'CAUSE
YEAH BUT W IT DON'T YOU HAVE TO LIKE GO SORT OF LIKE FOR IN A DOCUMENT VERSUS THE WHOLE THING
ISN'T THAT HOW IT WORKS THAT YOU C LOOK LOOK AT R
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE ISN'T IT LIKE THAT WE EXPECT TH THERE TO CHANGE OVER I B WITH THE DIFFERENT TOPIC SEGMENTS MORE
THAT THEY TALK ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN EACH DIFFERENT TOPIC SEGMENT
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT RELATIVE TERM FREQUENCY IS ABOUT THAT LIKE IN SOME CONTEXT THEY'RE TALKING MORE ABOUT A CERTAIN WORD THAN IN GENERAL
SO THAT WOULD MORE BE THE THE TOPIC SEGMENTS THEN
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S WAYS TO ABANDON THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF OF MEETINGS AND SORT OF BUT JUST NOT REALLY TREATING SEPARATE MEETINGS AS TOO MUCH OF A SEPARATE ENTITY
BUT
BUT ON ALGORITHMIC LEVEL WHETHER WE ACTUALLY WHETHER THERE'S SOME WAY TO JUST REPRESENT MEETINGS AS AS TOPICS
HMM
THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I MEANT
BUT I THINK I HAVE TO THINK MORE ABOUT WHAT I MEANT
UM G I'M CONFUSED ABOUT EVERYTHING
YEAH
I'M I'M NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE M A MEETING PLUS SOMETHING ELSE I'M MORE TALKING ABOUT LIKE YEAH
THE KEEPING KEEPING THE SAME ALGORITHM AND THE SAME WAY OF HANDLING IT AND JUST SAYING LIKE JUST THIS THIS TOPIC HERE I UH IT HAPPENS TO BE LIKE A WHOLE MEETING AND IT HAS SORT OF SUB TOPICS
SO JUST THAT SORT OF TOPICS A HIERARCHICAL CONCEPT WHERE LIKE A TOPIC WHERE THERE CAN BE SUPER TOPICS AND TOPICS
AND THE SUPER TOPICS ARE IN THE END WHAT THE MEETINGS ARE BUT IN GENERAL AT SOME LEVEL SUPER TOPICS ARE TREATED LIKE LIKE TOPICS
HMM
MM I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I WANT
SO SORRY COULD DESCRIBE THAT AGAIN THE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO THAT WOULD BE THE SERIES AS A WHOLE
THAT WOULD BE SORT OF M MEETINGS YEAH
YEAH
I'M A I'M A I'M A BIT BRAIN DAMAGED AT THE MOMENT BUT I THINK I'LL JUST SIT TOGETHER WITH YOU AGAIN AND AND GO THROUGH IT AGAIN
HMM
SO SO I'LL IS TH IT LIKE IS THIS AND THIS STRUCTURALLY THEN ALWAYS IDENTICAL
SO THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN TREAT IT WITH THE SAME ALGORITHM OR
YEAH I'M ALSO NOT SURE HOW WE CAN GO FROM FROM BOTTOM UP
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT'S LIKE MORE THAT OH WHATEVER I'M A CAN'T THINK OF IT AT THE MOMENT
PROBABLY THIS IS ALL TOO COMPLICATED WORRYING ABOUT THAT AT THAT MOMENT ANYWAY
NOW HAVE HAVE WE HAVE WE DECIDED ANYTHING ARE WE DOING ANYTHING
S WEDNESDAY WE ARE MEETING AND LOOKING AT THEIR AT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN SOME MORE DETAIL TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON
WE HAD TWO THINGS FROM THEIR STUFF JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LIKE UNDERSTAND IT WE UNDERSTAND IT ENOUGH TO TO M MODIFY IT
YEP
HOW WOULD WE DO THAT
BY JUST MAKING LIKE IT W READ WRITE FOR EVERYONE
'KAY WHO HAS MOST FREE SPACE ON THEIR
SAME HERE
WELL WE ALTERNATIVELY WE CAN PROBABLY JUST MAKE ANOTHER DIRECTORY ON THE BEEFY SCRATCH SPACE
I MEAN THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING GIGABYTES AND GIGABYTES OF STUFF AT THE MOMENT
NO
NO
YEAH
BUT I THINK IF HE SENDS TO THE I THINK IF HE SENDS TO THE PORT HE'D PROBABLY BE IN A BETTER POSITION
YEAH
HMM
I THINK HE SAID YES TO THAT
I THINK UH THAT WAS LIKE IN WHEN WE WERE STILL IN THE SEMINAR ROOM
I ASKED THAT ONCE OR LIKE ASK IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET IT OFF AND NOBODY SAID LIKE PEOPLE WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT THE TECHNICAL PRACTICALITIES
BUT NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT AL BEING ALLOWED TO OR NOT ALLOWED TO
I MEAN WE HAVE ACCESS TO IT HERE AND I GUESS IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT WE WE CAN'T GIVE IT TO ANYBODY ELSE
BUT
BUT IF THEY GIVE US ACCESS TO IT HERE O SITTING ON A DICE MACHINE
THEN THERE SHOULDN'T BE A REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE IT ON OUR LAPTOP
I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE TOO MANY FRIENDS WHO WOULD BE TOO KEEN ON GETTING IT ANYWAY
I HAVE THAT REALLY EXCITED PIRATE COPIED THING
IT ANNOTATED MEETING DATA
HUH
WAIT WAIT WAIT
UM SORRY
YEAH SORRY
WHAT I JUST REALISED WE SHOULD REALLY T KEEP DIFFERENT SERIESES COMPLETELY SEPARATE FOR VIRTUALLY ALL PURPOSES
JUST LET'S BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE
LIKE THE THE ICSI CORPUS ISN'T ISN'T ONE MEETING SERIES IT'S SEVERAL MEETING SERIES WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE MEETING FOR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS
FOR EACH MEETING
ALRIGHT
OKAY BUT LIKE LET'S JUST BE CAREFUL THAT WHATEVER WE SORT OF WE MERGE TOGETHER
THAT LIKE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MERGING IT'S NOT THE WHOLE ICSI CORPUS BUT INDIVIDUAL SERIES
I THINK WE MIGHT ACTUALLY I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BE SOMEWHERE LIKE WELL OR SOMETHING LIKE IT
UM I THINK WE MIGHT JUST GET AWAY WITH FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT JUST LIKE LOOKING AT ONLY ONE SERIES AND JUST DOING WITHIN ONE SERIES
I MEAN YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN ONE SERIES
OH YEAH LET'S TAKE THAT
IS THE IS THE DATA ALWAYS CLEARLY SPLIT UP BY DIFFERENT SERIES
UH LIKE IS IT EASY TO JUST PICK ONE
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO AT AT EVERY LEVEL EVERYONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL TO REALLY JUST TAKE EVEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL
JUST TAKE STUFF FROM ONE SERIES AND NOT MERGE STUFF FROM DIFFERENT SERIES TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE JUST MAJORLY MESSY
YEAH SO SO T SO LIKE IF EVEN IF WE MAKE ONE SINGLE TEXT FILE WHICH HAS THE WHOLE CORPUS
SORT OF OUR CORPUS THAT WOULD STILL BE FROM ONE SERIES ONLY
WOU BUT IT WHAT YOU'RE PRODUCING AT THE MOMENT IS LIKE INDIVIDUAL TEXT FILES THAT SORT OF HAVE THE RAW TEXT FOR A WHOLE A MEETING AS A WHOLE OR
MM-HMM
YEAH
'KAY
UM SO IS IS ANYBODY CREATING AN UH A REAL RAW TEXT THING AT THE MOMENT LIKE WHICH IS JUST THE WORDS
YEAH THA 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA NEED AS WELL
BUT I BUT IF THERE UH B AREN'T LIKE SO IT'S IT'S START AND END TIMES JUST FOR THE FILE
LIKE IS IT JUST THE FIRST AND THE LAST LINE
OR IS IT FOR EVERY SINGLE THING IN
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY JUST NOT PRINT OUT THAT
OKAY
IF YOU'RE INTO IT CAN YOU MAKE A TEXT FILE WHICH JUST LIKE MAKES JUST THE WORDS
'KAY
DO YOU WANT IT STRAIGHT FLOWING
'CAUSE I WOULD NEED SOMETHING THAT MARKS THE END OF UH OF UH IS IS YOURS SEGMENTED BY TOPICS THEN THAT LIKE IS THERE ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE TO THE TOPIC
TO THE AUTOMATED TOPIC TOPIC SEGMENTATION
OH THEN I NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT LATER ANYWAY
OKAY BUT FOR NOW IF YOU C
OKAY
YOU'RE GONNA PUT THAT AS AN OUTPUT OF YOURS THE SEGMENTATION
OKAY SO FOR NOW CAN YOU CREATE LIKE SORT OF JUST UH A DUMP WHICH IS PURE TEXT
JUST PURE TEXT SO THAT I CAN GET A DICTIONARY AND YOU CAN WORK ON THAT FOR YOUR TOPIC SEGMENTATION
AND
OR FOR FOR THE SERIES
BUT I CAN BUT I CAN ALSO DEAL WITH SEPARATE FILES I MEAN I CAN JUST WRITE THE ALGORITHM THAT IT LOADS ALL FILES IN A DIRECTORY OR SOMETHING
BUT I MEAN IF YOU
BUT IF YOU CAN PUT IT IN ONE SINGLE MEGA FILE THAT WOULD BE QUITE USEFUL FOR ME
EVEN THOUGH FOR YOU WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER IF YOU HAD DIFFERENT FILES BECAUSE THEN YOU SORT OF KNOW LIKE
YEAH
SO GIVE M GIVE ME DIFFERENT FILES AS LONG AS LIKE IT M IF YOU COULD NAME THEM IN A WAY THAT IS EASY TO ENUMERATE OVER THEM
LIKE WHATEVER ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE OR SOMETHING
OR JUST ANYTHING THAT I CAN
YEAH
IS IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY ENU LIKE TO ENUMERATE OVER
IS IT SOME JUST SOME ORDERED PATTERN
OKAY COOL
OKAY COOL
YEAH
IN THE RIGHT ORDER
IT'S JUST A WISH LIST
ORDERS
WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE UM LIKE A PRIMITIVE SEGMENTATION BY SOME READY MADE TOPIC SEGMENTATION BY SOME READY MADE TOOL READY
OKAY
OKAY COOL
'CAUSE I'LL NEED THAT THEN WHEN IT'S DONE
OKAY
MM-HMM
WHAT'S WHAT'S NINE MEGABYTE
THE THE
THAT SOUNDS QUITE REASONABLE
THAT'S NINE NINE CHARACTERS OVER OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
THAT IS FOR ARE WE ARE WE PICKING ONE PARTICULAR SERIES AT THE MOMENT
OR
YES
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH I GUESS WE CAN PROBABLY PROCESS THE DATA FOR ALL DIFFERENT SERIES AND THEN CHECK WHICH SERIES IS THE BEST FOR THE PRESENTATION
IT SOUNDS QUITE REASONABLE NINE MEGABYTE
I MEAN IF YOU THINK IF IT'S R ROUGHLY A MILLION WORDS AND NINE CHARACTERS PER WORD SOUNDS REALISTI
YEAH
YES I'M GONNA BUILD A DICTIONARY THEN FROM THAT
LIKE JUST A LIST OF THE WORDS THAT MAYBE A LIST OF THE WORDS WITH THE FREQUENCIES OR A LIST OF THE WORDS SORTED ALPHABETICALLY OR NUMERICALLY
WHAT WHAT DOES ANYONE WANT
DOES THIS THERE ANY WISHES FOR DICTIONARIES
SO I'LL CREATE A DICTIONARY
ADD ADD THE STRUCTURE YEAH
AND THEN THE ACTUAL FILE WE CAN PROBABLY LIKE COPY FROM YOUR HOME DIRECTORY OR SOMETHING LIKE IT
YEAH YEAH BUT I'M SA I'M SAYING FOR THE WHOLE THING IN THE END
THEN LIKE THE BIG THING WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO BY EMAIL
YEAH
OH FROM THE TIME I GET THE FILE I CAN DO THAT IN AN AFTERNOON THE NEXT SORT OF THE NEXT MORNING
OH YOU MEAN HOW LONG PROCESSING TIME IT TAKES
AH IT'S A IT'S A BOG STANDARD ALGORITHM
I'VE I'VE SORT OF I'VE WRITTEN IT FOR FOR DIL JUST IN HALF AN HOUR OR SOMETHING SIMILAR
IT'S JUST YOU PUT THEM IN A HASH TABLE AND AND SAY WELL IF IT EXISTS ALREADY IN THE HASH TABLE THEN YOU INCREASE THE COUNT BY ONE AND I'LL PROBABLY IMPLEMENT SOME FILTER FOR FILTERING OUT NUMBERS OR SOMETHING
REALLY
HOW DO YOU DO THAT
OKAY WELL I DON'T KNOW ANY PERL
I MEAN IF ANYONE WANTS TO DO A PERL SCRIPT FOR THAT THAT DOES IT DOES IT NICELY I UH
I'VE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT
I BUT I THINK I HAVE THE JAVA CODE VIRTUALLY READY BECAUSE FOR DIL I WROTE SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR
LIKE FOR DIL I WROTE SOMETHING THAT COUNTS THE THE DIFFERENT OCCURRENCES OF ALL THE TAGS UM
SORRY
THE HASH TABLE
UH I'VE NEVER SERIALIZED ANYTHING
WOULDN'T THAT BE ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE THOUGH
AND THEN SERIALI AND THEN WRITE THE SERIALIZATION TO A FILE
SO YOU WANT LIKE A SE LIKE A FILE WHICH IS THE SERIALIZATION OF A HASH TABLE
OKAY
YEAH
I I'LL I'LL CHECK IF I UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS
I MEAN OTHERWISE I CAN GIVE YOU THE CODE FOR LOADING A DICTIONARY
GIVE YOU MY MY IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S SORT OF IT'S A LINE BREAK SEPARATED FILE YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH I'LL SEE IF I UNDERSTAND HOW TO SERIALIZE
THERE'S A THERE'S A SERIALISE COMMAND SO THAT GIVES ME ONE MEGA MOTHER OF A S
YEAH BUT DO THEY AUTOMATICALLY WRITE TO THE FILE ANYWAY I'LL I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT
WE DON'T HAVE TO
YES IS THAT PRETTY MUCH
PRETTY MUCH IT
SO DAVE AND ME LOOK AT HOW NITE X. M. L. WORKS AND WE'RE
HMM
I'LL BUILD A DICTIONARY AS SOON AS I GET THE TEXT
AND YEAH SO THAT
WHEN DO WE HAVE TO MEET AGAIN THEN WITH THIS
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO A DEMONSTRATOR NEXT WEEK
MY GOD
NO NO NOT DEMONSTRATE BUT LIKE DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT UH DIDN'T WE SORT OF AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE A DEMONSTRATOR OF IT
LIKE SOME PRIMITIVE THING WORKING NEXT WEEK
THAT'S GOTTA BE VERY PROTOTYPE
MM-HMM
AH WELL LET'S GO
SORRY
I FEEL LIKE LIKE HANGING MID AIR AND NOT REALLY LIKE FINDING A POINT WHERE YOU CAN GET YOUR TEETH INTO IT AND START WORKING PROPERLY AND SO IT'S ALL SO FUZZY THE WHOLE
YEAH BUT IT AT THE MOMENT BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S ALSO AN IMPLEMENTATIONAL LEVEL
LIKE WITH THE DATA STRUCTURES I'M JUST LIKE OVER THESE VAGUE IDEAS OF SOME TREES I'M F
YEAH
IT'S JUST WE ARE HALF WAY THROUGH THE PROJECT TIME TABLE
THAT'S JUST WHAT FREAKS ME OUT
UM
HMM
IT'S WITH CAMERAS
YOU LOOK QUITE FUNNY AT THE MOMENT TIM
NICE
MM YES
YES PERHAPS YEAH BUT I MEAN THEY'RE ALL VERY VERY SIMILAR ALL THOSE X. M. L. FILES
I HAD UM A LOOK AT THE UM FOR EXAMPLE A. S.
MM
TAKE MOZILLA
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE M I MEAN UH FOR ME IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO SAY O ON
YOU KNOW W UM WHAT SCOPE ONE ANNOTATION WOULD HAVE
I THINK IT WOULD BE CERTAINLY MORE THAN ONE WORD AND
I THINK IT WOULD WORK BEST WITH UTTERANCES OR SEGMENTS
YEP
I THINK JUST THE SEGMENTS AS THEY'RE SEGMENTED IN THE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE POINT SE POINT SIX FIVE
I THINK SO
AND YOU WOULD S PROBABLY STILL NEED UM YOUR VALUES FOR THE WORDS UM PERHAPS FOR FOR UM THE KEYWORDS THAT ARE DISPLAYED
WHEN YOU CLICK ON SOMETHING
YEAH BUT THAT'S ANOTHER REPRESENTATION THEN I THINK F FOR THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE
SHOULD YEAH
UM PO
YES
NO IT'S NOT
IT'S UM FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S UH B. D. B. O. O. ONE C. POINT SIX
UH I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING VERY MUCH BUT YEAH THAT'S THAT'S IT
CAN YOU USE A BIGGER FONT
OKAY SO HERE THERE'S FOR UM EACH SEGMENT UM UH THAT'S REALLY ALL SEGMENTS I MEAN IT'S IT CAN BE WORDS OR TOPICS OR UM ANYTHING I THINK
UM THAT'S WHY TH IT'S FOR EXAMPLE TIME PROVENANCE DIALOGUE ACT OR TIME PROVENANCE SEGMENT OR TIME PROVENANCE
NO BUT IT YEAH
YEAH IT P OH WELL SOME OF THEM POINT TO THE WORDS OTHER OTHERS POINT TO THE UM DIALOGUE ACTS
SO THAT'S KIND OF THE GLOBAL THING THAT TIES TOGETHER OTHER THINGS
UM
YEAH THEY HAVE THEIR NITE I. D. THE TIME
THE SEGMENT IS WHAT IS DISPLAYED IN ONE LINE UM BY NITE
YEAH IT LOOKS UH UH THE SEGMENT THING LOOKS IN THE INTO THE WORDS X. M. L. FILE AND THE DIALOGUE ACTS
UM THING
YEAH I THINK IT'S IN A DIFFERENT
UM
NO THEIR THEIR ANNOTATION OF DIALOGUE ACTS
AND ONE UM SEGMENT CAN HAVE OR ONE UM OF THOSE WORD STRINGS THAT ARE PRESENTED IN ONE LINE CAN HAVE SEVERAL UM DIALOGUE ACTS ANNOTATED ON IT
THAT'S WHY
YEAH IT'S FROM WORDS
YES
THAT'S JUST BELOW
BUT I THINK THESE SEGMENTS ARE PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST O ONE TYING ALL THE OTHERS TOGETHER
AND THE INFORMATION OR R I MEAN WE ARE GOING TO CREATE A FILE THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE UM THE WORDS FILE
I THINK
YES
YEAH THEY ARE
UM TO DISCOURSE MARKER DIS F. MARKER FI POINT FIVE
YEAH THAT'S THERE NO NO UP UP
GO UP
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH THIS IS ALL THE SPEAKER D.
YOU AND THE SPEAKER D.
YES
UM YOU CAN SEE WHETHER THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE OR NOT
YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE W UM W. POINT UM FIRST IT'S W. POINT UM FIVE UH FIFTY FOUR AND THEN IT'S SEVENTY SIX
SO THERE ARE UM THIS NUMBER OF UTTERANCES OF OTHER SPEAKERS IN BETWEEN
YEAH I THINK WE WOULD ALSO NEED TWO OF THOSE
YEAH I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE ONE THAT POINTS TO IT WHERE WE TIE TOGETHER ALL OUR INFORMATION
SO WE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE TO MAKE ONE THAT'S SIMILAR
YES AND UH THEN ANOTHER ONE THAT WOULD PERHAPS GIVE THE ACTUAL PROBABILITY VALUE
YEAH IT COULD COULD PROBABLY BE IN THE SAME FILE I DON'T KNOW
BUT IF YOU HAVE SEVERAL LAYERS THEN
YOU CAN'T REPRESENT THEM ON THE SAME FILE
YEAH IN SEGMENT POINT ONE
UM THERE LINE BELOW
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I MEANT ACTUALLY YEAH
MM-HMM
UM
BUT I I MEAN THERE'S NOT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT IS IN IN THE C CORPUS IN THERE IN THE SEGMENTS FILE
I THINK THAT IS JUST THE UM THINGS THAT ARE LOADED EVERY TIME BUT WE HAVE LAZY LOADING SO IT CAN LOAD MORE THAN THAT
PERHAPS WE COULD JUST TRY TO COPE
UM YOU KNOW TO
MAKE OUR FILE ONE OF THOSE LAZY LOADED
BUT I MEAN I'VE NO REAL IDEA HOW THAT WORKS
YEAH BUT YES BUT IT HAS UM YOU KNOW A BASIC THING THAT IT LOADS I THINK
SO FOR EXAMPLE EVERY TIME IT LOADS THE SEGMENT THINGS IT CAN'T IT CAN'T NOT DISPLAY WORDS I THINK
AND IT ERAS
I THINK SO
THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTOOD IT
BECAUSE OTHERWISE IN THE IN THE OTHER THINGS THERE IS NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE PARTICIPANT NAME IS AND SO ON
SO
IN THE SEGMENTS FILE IT'S REALLY THE VERY BASIC THAT HAVE TO BE DISPLAYED FOR ANY THING
YEAH I THIN I MEAN IT WOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT TO UM CREATE A FILE OF THE P SH OF THAT SHAPE
I MEAN THAT WOULD BE NO PROBLEM
UM YEAH I I DON'T KNOW HOW ABOUT YOU WITH YOUR WORDS
BUT UM FOR MY SEGMENTS WERE THE UM F. ZERO MEASUREMENTS AND ALL THOSE VALUES I GET FROM THERE
UM I ALWAYS STORE THE BEG UH START AND END TIME OF EVERYTHING I CALCULATED THERE SO I WOULD JUST HAVE TO PU PUT IT UH YES
YEAH IT IS
UH ACTU BUT ACTUALLY MY SEGMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME AS THEIR SEGMENTS BECAUSE AND THEIR SEGMENTS THERE ARE UM PAUSE UM PAUSES SOMETIMES
A
UM YES BUT UH YEAH I MEAN ONE SEGMENT OF THEIRS IS SOMETIMES TWO SEGMENTS OF MINE THAT'S JUST WHAT I MEANT
YEAH BUT FOR EXAMPLE I MADE A FILE THAT CONTAINS JUST THE UM START TIMES
IT COULD CONTAIN END TIMES AND WORDS FOR ALL SPEAKERS OF ALL MEETINGS
I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE SAME THING AS I GAVE YEAH AS I GAVE TO YOU
BUT UM UH DISPLAYING ALSO A START AND END TIMES OF EVERY WORD
SO YOU COULD PERHAPS USE IT TO MATCH UM IT WITH YOUR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU GOT COULDN'T YOU
PERL A PERL SCRIPT YEAH
NO NO
MM YEAH
BUT WOULD YOU THEN NOT GET THE TYPICAL WORDS FOR EVERY SPEAKER
IF YOU
BECAUSE IT WOULD THEN SAY HOW IT FIND THAT IT'S THAT SPEAKER
YEAH
IT'S PROBABILITY YEAH
OR OR VALUE YEAH
SO COULD YOU PUT THE MORE INFORMATION BACK IN THEN
YEAH BUT THE TOPIC ISN'T IT
THAT'S A TOPIC INFORMATION
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO HOW SURE OR UNSURE YOU ARE ABOUT THE WHAT'S FOLLOWING OUR B OUR CONTEXT MEASURES YEAH
YEAH
BUT DO WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMA ENOUGH DATA FOR THAT IT GIVES US SENSIBLE THINGS
BECAUSE I MEAN THE THE WORDS WE'RE LOOK REALLY LOOKING FOR APPEAR NOT TOO OFTEN
AND IF THEY APPEAR FIVE TIMES IN THE MEETING AND THEY HAVE EACH TIME A DIFFERENT
YOU KNOW DIFFER SOME DIFFERENT SURROUNDED WORDS PERHAPS WE HAVE NOT ENOUGH DATA
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU
YEAH OKAY
MM-HMM
BUT THAT WOULD GIVE THE SAME VALUE FOR ONE WORD EVERY TIME I MEAN FOR FOR A SPECIFIC WORD
YEAH BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD BE QUITE EASY TO RE INTEGRATE IT INTO SUCH A
OKAY BUT THEN IT WOULD ALSO BE POSSIBLE TO RE INTEGRATE IT
IT WOULD BE MORE DIF I MEAN IT WOULD BE A BIT MORE WORK BUT THEN
YES
UM AND WHAT WELL WHAT SCORE WOULD A WORD GET THAT JUST OCCURS ONCE IN ALL THE CORPUS FOR EXAMPLE
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ALL THE OTHER SAME TOPICS WHERE IT DOESN'T OCCUR
MM-HMM
SO WOULD IT BE HIGHER SCORED THAN A WORD THAT UM OCCURS
IN
EVERY UM SEQUENCE OF THE SAME TOPIC
YEAH I MEAN UM WE HAVE UH S UH OUR SEVERAL TOPICS
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE TWENTY TOPICS AND UM FOR ONE OF THESE TOPICS THERE ARE FIVE OCCURRENCES AND WE HAVE ONE WORD THAT
YES BUT ACROSS MEETINGS UM THERE WILL BE THE SAME TOPIC SEVERAL TIMES
AH
IT WASN OKAY
I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE DOING
YEAH BUT
YEAH BUT YOU MAKE ALSO UM SEGMENT SIMILARITY I THINK THAT WAS I I THOUGHT THAT WOULD
AND THEY THEY ARE NOT RELATED THEN TO OTHER BLOCKS OF
OKAY
I UM
OH OKAY
I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT THEN
SO YEAH HOW WOULD IT WORK
I MEAN WHAT WOULD
UM THE HIS INFORMATION THEN BE USEFUL FOR IN R RAINBOW
UM I THOUGHT THE POINT ABOUT THAT WAS THAT WE WOULD PUT UM INTO S UM SERIAL CATEGORIES ALL THE SEGMENTS OF THE SAME TOPIC ACROSS MEETINGS
OKAY
YEAH BUT BUT THEN IT DOES OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
MM
YEP
YEAH
MM YEAH
YES
YEAH I MEAN I HAVEN'T REALLY DECIDED ON UH HOW TO REALLY GET THE INFORMATION OUT OF THIS NOW
BECAUSE UM WHEN I HAVE FOR EXAMPLE UM INCREASED SPEAKER OVERLAP THAT APPLIES TO SEVERAL TURNS OF COURSE
BUT I COULD GIVE UM THE INFORMATION ABOUT YEAH HOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS
YEAH
PROS UM BUT YOU PROPOSED UM WE WE SHOULD BREAK THAT DOWN TO HAVE UM THE SMALLEST UM SMALLEST UM UNITY UM OF TIME DURATION SHOULD BE ONE WORD
I MEAN THAT WOULD BE BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE WHAT NATURALLY CAME OUT OF HER THING
AND
YEAH SURE BUT I COULD THEN IF I IF I HAVE UM THE VALUE FOR A SEGMENT I WOULD PERHAPS JUST GIVE ALL THE
IMPORTANT WOR OR MM YEAH NO
YES
MM-HMM
YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT SOMEONE HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN AYE
I WOULD PROBABLY SOMEHOW HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN TO TO THAT LEVEL YEAH
YES SURE
YEAH PROBABLY SOMEHOW IT SHOULD WORK THAT WAY
YEAH BUT THEN OKAY BUT TH AT THAT MOMENT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO JUST MAKE IT ON A PER SEGMENT BASIS RIGHT WAY
AND LET HER ADAPT IT ALSO TO THE SEGMENT BASIS
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN MINE ARE ONLY MORE BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME START AND END POINT
SOMETIMES THEY'RE TWO SEGMENTS AND ONE WITH A GAP IN BETWEEN BUT UM THE HAVE UM TH TH THEY DON'T OVERLAP
NO NO THEY DON'T BUT UM
UM
THEY'RE I MEAN MY SEGMENTS OVERLAP IN THE SAME WAY AS THEIRS DO
BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE UM SPLIT ONE OF THE SEGMENTS INTO TWO SEGMENTS BUT IT'S EASY TO MATCH THE START AND END TIMES TO MAP IT TO THEIR SEGMENTS
I UH HOPE SO YEAH
MM-HMM YEAH
THAT WOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT BUT YEAH
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I'M ALREADY DOING WITH MY S UH SEPARATE
YEAH IT'S TELLS YOU EVEN WHICH WORDS IT IS
YEP
SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
YEP
YEAH I HOPE TO HAVE SOME VALUE QUITE SOON
BUT UM I JUST WORKED UM I MEAN I JUST CALCULATED THE VALUES VALUES FOR UM THE AVERAGE F. ZEROS AND UM THEY'RE WHAT'S C I MEAN I DIDN'T HAVE A LOOK AT THE DATA YET
BUT UM THEY VARY QUITE WIDELY EVEN FOR THE SAME SPEAKER ACROSS MEETINGS
SO ONE SPEAKER HAD UM AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT A HUN ONE HUNDRED UM IN ONE MEETING AND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY IN ANOTHER MEETING THAT'S REALLY THAT'S STRANGE
I MEAN PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE OF LAUGHTER OR SOMETHING THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
I'LL PROBABLY LOOK AT IT
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I READ IN ONE OF THOSE PAPERS UH AS WELL BUT
YEAH BUT IT COULD MESS UP THINGS QUITE CONSIDERABLY
YEAH
BUT UH AR YEAH
BUT ALL THIS IS QUITE YOU KNOW DATA INTENSIVE
I WHEN I UM LET THE UM JUST CALCULATE THE AVERAGE F. ZERO LEVELS
IT I THINK IT NEEDED MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN WHAT HAVE HALF AN HOUR F TO DELAY IT FOR OUR MEETINGS
BECAUSE UM YEAH M I MEAN WE HAVE SEVENTY FIVE HOURS PER YEAH
AV AVERAGE OF SIX SPEAKERS AND THEY'RE MEASURED EVERY O. POINT O. ONE SIX SECONDS
AND THAT GIVES US QUITE A LOT OF VALUES
YEAH WHAT I DID AT THE MOMENT IS UM I UM YEAH I GOT THE F. ZERO VALUES FROM FOR EACH SPEAKER FOR HIS HEADPHONE
AND I ONLY TAKE THOSE UM THE W UH THAT WERE RECORDED AT THE TIME WHERE HE WAS ACTUALLY SPEAKING
AND FOR THOSE I CALCULATED UM THE AVERAGE
ZERO
SO THAT GAVE ME UM NOW ONE VALUE PER SPEAKER PER MEETING
NO NO THAT'S JUST THE AVERAGE
NO THAT I YEAH
YES I MEAN I R JUST UH NEEDED TO HAVE THIS VALUE NOW TO RELATE UM M HOW YEAH
YEAH I THINK
YEAH
UM AMUSEMENT AND SO ON IS YEAH
YEAH
I I I MEAN IT I ACTUALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHAT CAUSES THESE UM
BECAUSE IT'S QUITE FUNNY TO HAVE A M MALE SPEAKING AT TWO HUN TWO HUNDRED UM
YEAH SURE BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH AND I AM AT THE MOMENT FIDDLING AROUND WITH MY DATA AND NOT QUITE SEEING HOW I GET TO A SENSIBLE ABSTRACTION LEVEL YOU KNOW
FROM MY VERY
YEAH
YEAH
SO I MEAN YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH SOME DATA EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE
TRY UH TRY YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH IF IT'S ALREADY ON SEGMENTS BASE THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH
HMM
THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE JUST
AH SOD THAT
OKAY THERE
GROUP K.
DA
YEAH
YEAH I GUESS
WHATEVER
IT'S YEAH I NEVER GET THIS SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF IF THIS IS STRAPLESS IF THIS STRAP'S SUPPOSED TO GO BEHIND M I OBVIOUSLY DOING THIS WRONG
OBVIOUSLY FAILING THIS LIKE WHATEV CALLING CENTRE AND TRA
LIKE THIS AND THEN YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT THE SHIT HAS TO DO NOW
OKAY
YES SO UM ACTUALLY I JUST REALISE I DON'T HAVE POWER LET ME JUST SWITCH ON THE OTHER WHICH IS GONNA RUN OUT
OKAY
SO THERE'S PROBABLY NOT MUCH TO TALK ABOUT AT THE MOMENT IN TERMS OF LIKE TALKING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S STUFF I MEAN BEYOND WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY
SO WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING IS MAYBE IF WE TRY TO REALLY MAKE SENSE TOGETHER OF THE X. M. L. FORMAT TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN ALL PRODUCE THE DATA THAT WE ARE PRODUCING IN A WAY OR AT LEAST I MEAN I GUESS MY DATA I'LL PROBABLY LOAD IN FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY ANYWAY BECAUSE IT'S MATRIX
BUT ALL THIS STUFF THAT GOES WITH ANNOTATION THAT WE HAVE IT IN THE RIGHT FORMAT
MAYBE IF WE JUST SORT OF POOL WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE X. M. L. FORMAT AND TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF IT
I DON'T AT ALL KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT THIS
UM WHAT I DID JUST NOW IS I DOWNLOADED
UM I DOWNLOADED SOME
FILES
SOME X. M. L. FILES AND I WAS THINKING IF WE MAYBE JUST SHOULD GO THROUGH SOME OF THEM AND LIKE TRY TO SEE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL STRUCTURE AND POOL TOGETHER WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE
WHAT WE THINK THAT THINGS MEAN
AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW THE ANNOTATION FOR INFORMATION DENSITY AND STUFF SHOULD MAYBE BE STRUCTURED IN A SIMILAR WAY
OR BUT I DON'T R I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN IDEA LIKE WHAT OTHER WORDS WHAT WE WOULD DO TODAY IN THIS MEETING
I MEAN
WHAT'S THAT PART
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES SO DOES ANYONE HAVE A GOOD IDEA WHERE TO START LIKE WHICH WHAT SO WHAT IS IT WE TALK ABOUT GETTING IN AT THE MOMENT
WE'RE BASICALLY JUST 'CAUSE THE TWO OF YOU WILL MERGE YOUR DATA TOGETHER RIGHT
IN SOME WAY LIKE I IN THE END IT'LL RESULT IN ONE ANNOTATION
SO THE ONLY THING WE'RE TRYING TO TIE IN IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL ANNOTATION WHICH IS SIMILAR TO
THE ANNOTATION ABOUT WHAT WHAT WOULD IT BE S MOST SIMILAR TO
SIMPLY TO THE SEGMENTATION INFORMATION OR
OKAY
I'M NOT SURE IT AH
SEE THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING
NOT SURE WHAT SOFTWARE I HAVE AT THE MOMENT WHICH WOULD BE HELLO
UM
YEAH
AH
DOES ANYONE KNOW ANY GOOD STANDARDS SOFTWARE DISPLAYS X. M. L. I'M NOT SURE
YEAH BUT I'M AFRAID I ONLY HAVE FIREFOX AND FIREFOX DOESN'T HAVE THE NICE X. M. L. VIEWER ANYMORE
I THINK I DON'T HAVE MOZILLA
NO
I CAN PROBABLY JUST EMACS THEM
BUT
BUT GOING FROM FROM A WORD BUSINESS WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER TO THEN GO BACK AND CALCULATE FOR EACH UTTERANCE
YOU KNOW WHA WHA EACH TURN SO IF WE
YEAH
SO D
DOES ANYONE DOES ANYONE KNOW IN WHICH FILE THE ACTUAL LIKE WHAT'S IT CALLED THE SPLITTING INTO THE UTTERANCES
IS IS CALLED IS THAT
IS IT
WHAT DOES IT END WITH
DOES IT WITH WITH SAX
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IT
OKAY
BE NICE
LET'S ACTUALLY JUST SEE IF MAYBE K. RIGHT
OH THIS IS HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND JUST GETTING THE RIGHT SOFTWARE GOING
IS THAT BETTER TO SEE
I GUESS YEAH WHITE AND BLACK IS BETTER TO SEE
SO JUST SEE IF I CAN VIEW
OKAY
SO
THIS THIS
BUT WHAT IS THIS
I MEAN THIS DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY CONTENT
LIKE ANY TEXT
OH WAIT SOMEBODY S S SOMEBODY EXPLAIN THAT SLOWLY TO ME
SO
SO WHAT DO ALL THESE THINGS IN THIS FILE HAVE IN COMMON
WHAT WHAT ARE THEY
NO BUT W LIKE UH SO THEY ARE THEY ARE SEGMENTS IN WHAT SENSE
WH WHAT'S DEFINITION OF A SEGMENT THEN
OKAY
AND
AND THAT'S USUALLY DIALOGUE WHAT WHAT'S DIFFERENCE I BETWEEN PROVENANCE DIALOGUE ACT AND BETWEEN SEGMENTER
I DON'T
A DIALOGUE ACT UH A DIALOGUE ACT ANNOTATIONS OF DIALOGUE ACT
SO IS THAT JUST ANOTHER REPRESENTATION OF TEXT
JUST SEE CAN WE HAVE THIS FILES SOMEWHERE
SO THE STUFF THAT'S
THAT'S CALLED SEGMENT HERE THAT DO WE KNOW WHICH FILE THIS IS PULLING FROM
FROM YEAH IT'S IT'S C IT FROM WORDS X. M. L. IS THAT IT'S SAYING HERE
LET ME SEE IF I HAVE THAT WORDS X. M. L. FILE
SO LET'S FOR EXAMPLE LOOK AT
OKAY LET ME JUST TRY TO GET THEM ALL TO A DIFFERENT SCREEN
UH UH IS THAT WHAT WE WERE
SORRY I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO ARRANGE THEM SO THAT WE HAVE ONE ABOVE THE OTHER SO TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THAT
SO NO
HERE WE HAD
UM I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS SEGMENTS FILE IS ABOUT
LIKE IT'S IT'S REFERENCING HERE IT'S REFERENCING TO
TO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE IN THE WORDS FILE
SO IT'S THAT NON VOCAL SOUND ONE HERE
THAT'S THE MIC NOISE OKAY
BUT WHAT'S THE DOES IT ALWAYS JUST OH NO IT'S IT'S REFERENCING TO SEVERAL WORD STRUCTURES
SO THIS WOULD BE BASICALLY BE A A SEQUENCE RIGHT
SO THAT'S FROM W. FIFTY TWO
ARE THEY NOT ORDERED OR OH YEAH FROM W. FIFTY TWO DOWN TO W. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
AND YEAH W SORRY
OKAY
SO THIS SO THIS IS SOMEBODY SAYING IT IT DOESN'T
DO WE HAVE ANY CONFIRMATION DO WE ACTUALLY SEE FROM THIS FILE WHO'S DOING IT JUST OUT OF INTEREST
OH
SORRY IN SPEAKER D. 'S FILE
SO THIS IS WHERE HE'D LIKE TIME STOPS
AND THEN IT ONLY STARTS AT A LATER TIME BECAUSE OH YOU DON'T SEE WHEN I'M POINTING AT SCREEN IT'S JUST FOR THIS
SO THEN IT STARTS HERE THIS TIME AGAINST SPEAKER D. BECAUSE IN BETWEEN THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO THE THE FILE WITH ANNOTATIONS FOR INFORMATION DENSITY WHAT WOULD THAT BE LIKE
WOULD THAT BE LIKE THE SEGMENTS FILE GIVING A START WORD AND END WORD OR OR WOULD THAT
HOW WOULD THAT BE TO BEST TIE IN WITH THE SYSTEM
SORRY
SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR LIKE WHERE YOU GIVE SORT OF A REFERENCE TO A BEGINNING AND AN END POSITION
WELL THAT WOULD BE IN THE SAME FILE WOULDN'T IT
IT WOULD JUST COULDN'T WE HAVE A LIKE UH
I GUESS WE COULD INTRODUCE A DIFFERENT UM
WE HAVE FOR NOW IF WE JUST DO SOMETHING WHICH FOR EVERY
SEGMENT IN HERE ATTACHES ACTUALLY CAN WE NOT TIE IT TO THE SEGMENTS FILE
WOULD THAT NOT BE THE WAY HOW THEY WOULD WANT IT TO HAVE TO DO AS IF WE IN THE END
IF WE WANT TO ATTACH TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS ONE NUMBER FOR NOW
AND THOSE SEGMENTS HAVE UH DO THEY HAVE AN I. D.
YEAH I GUESS THEY DO
SO THIS IS THE I. D. OF A SPECIFIC SEGMENT RIGHT
YEAH SO WOULDN'T IT I MEAN THE PROBLEM IS THEY'VE ME HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE EXACT INNER WORKINGS OF THEIR OF THEIR ENGINEERED
BUT YOU'D THINK THAT THE EASIEST WAY AND THE WAY THAT HOW IT'S INTENDED TO BE WOULD BE JUST
IF WE HAVE HERE A LINK TO THE SEGMENT A LIKE AN I. D. FOR THAT SEGMENT
THAT WE JUST CREATE ANOTHER FILE WHICH LINKS TO THE SEGMENT AND THEN HAS AN ADDITIONAL VALUE WHICH IS THE NUMBER
YEAH YEAH
YEAH OH SORRY I I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVING TWO FILES
I WAS THINK YEAH I I THINK THAT I I UNDERSTOOD WRONG
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WANTING TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT X. M. L. FILES WITH ONE THE REFERENCE AND ONE JUST TH JUST THE NUMBER
AND I WAS THINKING THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT YOU MEANT JUST UM HAVING LIKE FOR EACH SORT OF OF OUR SEGMENTS HAVING JUST THE I. D.
WHICH IS REFERENCING TO THESE SEGMENTS HERE AND ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE WHICH IS THE THE VALUE
SO THIS WHOLE INFORMATION WE WOULD THEN STORE IN THIS AH NO
THAT I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BECAUSE I DIDN'T DOWNLOAD LIKE THERE'S THIS ONE META INFORMATION FILE WHERE IT DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE OF ALL THE FILES AND DESCRIBES WHICH UM WHICH ATTRIBUTES THEY BRING IN
SO WE WOULD ADD THAT TO THAT FILE
SAYING THAT SORT OF WE BRING IN INFORMATION DENSITY
AND THEN WE WOULD CREATE THE FILE OF THAT TYPE WHICH WE PROBABLY COULDN'T CALL IT SEGMENT
I'M NOT SURE
WE PROBABLY MIGHT HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT WORD FOR IT
I'M NOT SURE IF IT THERE'S ANY TROUBLE WITH IT REPEATING
IN THE EXISTING SEGMENTS FILE
YEAH I RECKON ACTUALLY IF WE MAKE A COPY OF IT
WHAT UH WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT THE W I TH DOESN'T THE LAZY LOADING APPLY TO EVERYTHING
I MEAN THAT IT SORT OF DYNAMICALLY LOADS
YOU THINK IT I IT L IT LOADS THE WHOLE OF THE SEGMENTS FILE EVERY TIME
OKAY
THE SEGMENT AT THE MOMENT IS SPLIT UP OVER
HMM
NO BUT I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO REALLY LIKE DISCUSS THAT IN DETAIL
BECAUSE WE DON'T AT ALL UNDERSTAND AT THE MOMENT HOW THE INTERNAL DATA STRUCTURE LIKE HOW THE LOADING WORKS
SO MAYBE IF WE G IF WE GO AHEAD
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO AN LIKE SOMETHING LIKE SEGMENTS OR MAYBE JUST A COPY OF SEGMENT WHICH HAS AN ATTRIBUTE FOR FOR EACH SEGMENT
UM BUT IT IS LIKE WITH A WITH A VALUE WITH A DENSITY VALUE
WOULD IT BE EASIER THOUGH BECAUSE ALL YOUR METHODS ARE SORT OF NOT WORKING WITH THEIR WHOLE TIME FRAME STRUCTURE THERE
SO WOULD IT BE EASY FOR YOU TO TO TIE THE THINGS TOGETHER
LIKE IF YOU'RE DOING IT ON ON THE WORD BASIS HERE WITH THOSE WORDS THAT IN THE END YOU THEN TIE IT BACK IN INTO THE RIGHT SEGMENT HERE
I MEAN
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO DO A BIT OF
HMM
YOU'RE DOING IT TIME BASED AT THE MOMENT
SO THIS ISN'T DIRECTLY HAVING TIME REFERENCES BUT YOU CAN GET THE OH IT IS ACTUALLY HERE
OKAY
SO IF YOU SLICE IT UP BY TIME YOU'D PROBABLY BE ABLE TO JUST LIKE ATTACH LIKE JUST SOME ATTRIBUTE OF
INFO VAL JUST F TO EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS
MM-HMM
'KAY
UM I DON'T UNDERSTAND ENOUGH OF WHAT THEIR DATA STRUCTURE IS
THIS PROBABLY WOULD BE A LOT EASIER WOULD I REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE HANDLING THE DATA INTERNALLY 'CAUSE THEN WE C THEN I COULD SAY OH
IT'S EASY TO JUST TIE IT IN IF YOU JUST HAVE IT TIME STAMPED THAT JUST REFERENCE BY WORDS AND STUFF
BUT T AT THE MOMENT
SO YOU WOULD YOU'RE DOING I YOU'RE DOING A WORD BY WORD BASE
MM-HMM
OKAY
BUT EVERY WORD DOES DOES THE WORD PICKING LIKE DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION VALUE IN YOUR THING I DOES IT DEPEND ON ITS POSITION LIKE
IT BE D DEPENDS ON THE POSITION
HMM
AND YOU'RE DOING THIS VIA SOME SOFTWARE THAT'S LIKE EXTERNAL SOFTWARE SO YOU CAN'T
SO WHAT IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU GET THE RESULTS FROM THAT SOFTWARE AND YOU GO BACK OVER IT THEN WITH THAT FILE SORT OF
YOU WRITE AN ALGORITHM WHICH WHICH THEN GOES BACK BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT ORDER STILL AND STUFF RIGHT
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
OH BUT THIS IS BY SPEAKER HERE WHICH MAKES IT SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT
THE PROBLEM IS THAT ACTUALLY NITE X. M. L. PROBABLY PROVIDES A LOT OF THE TOOLS THAT WE'D NEED TO DO THAT
IN IN A TEMPORAL SEQUENCE
BUT BUT WOULD THE INFORMATION DENSITY ALGORITHM STILL MAKE ANY SENSE IF YOU SPLIT THEM UP
BECAUSE I MEAN THE WHOLE I THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY OF A WORD IN THAT SPECIFIC HOW OFTEN A WORD INC OCCURS IN A CERTAIN TOPIC VERSUS HOW OFTEN IT OCCURS OVER THE WHOLE CORPUS AND THAT FROM THAT IT CALCULATES
MM-HMM
YEAH I HAVE A GUT FEELING IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SPLIT IT
YEAH
NO BUT I MEAN IT CAN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT
IF YOU IF YOU ALREADY HAVE YOU HAVE IN THE RIGHT ORDER ALL THE WORDS WITH A WITH A SCORE TO THEM
AND YOU HAVE A FILE WHICH HAS EACH WORD AND A TIME STAMP
SO THOSE TWO TIED TOGETHER HAVE EACH WORD AND ITS TIME AND
AND AND AND ITS PROBA AND ITS VALUE
YEAH
SO THEY'RE THEY'RE AT THE MOMENT SO
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT RAINBOW WAS MADE FOR SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
HMM
I ACTUALLY LIKE UM UM I ARE YOU ACTUALLY SURE THAT RAINBOW IS DOING A MEASURE LIKE IS RETURNING A MEASURE OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO MEASURE
'CAUSE IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S JUST IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT IN IN D MANY ASPECTS
MM-HMM
AND W
YEAH
YEAH
BUT WHERE DO YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL CATEGORY INFORMATION FROM
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHERE DO YOU WHERE DO YOU HAVE THEM FROM AT THE MOMENT THE SPLIT UP
IN I IN THE T IN THE TOPICS IN THE IN THE HUMAN TOPIC S UM SO YOU'VE SPLIT THEM UP BY TOPIC AT THE MOMENT
YEAH BUT
OKAY OKAY OKAY
'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL BUT YEAH IF YOU IF THAT'S JUST WHILE YOU'RE WAITING
OKAY
HAVE YOU EVER LIKE LOOKED INTO DIFFERENT WAYS OF CALCULATING 'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING LIKE I MEAN THE FOR EXAMPLE THE THE INFOR UM WHAT'S IT CALLED
THE ENTROPY CALCULATION IS THAT SHE BOXED IT UNDER THE SIMPLE CALCULATION THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY WRITE THE SCRIPT IN NO TIME AT ALL AND
YEAH BUT I'M ALSO JUST LIKE I THINK THAT PROBABLY THE ENTROPY VALUE AT THE MOMENT FOR A WORD IS CLOSER TO WHAT WE'RE AT THE MOMENT LOOKING FOR
I CAN JUST LIKE K K I CAN SIT TOGETHER WITH YOU FOR TWENTY MINUTES AND JUST SHOW YOU THE ENTROPY CODE THAT I WROTE FOR MY OTHER PROJECT AND IT PROBABLY AND WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S WE USED T WE HAVE TO WE'D USE THE SAME MATRIX AS I'M USING IN MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
YOU'D USE TO CALCULATE ENTROPY SCORES
AND THEN WE'D HAVE UM A SCORE WHICH ACTUALLY WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME FOR THE WORD IN EACH POSITION
SO IN THAT SENSE IT'S DOING SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT
AND LIKE W BASICALLY THE SCORE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A CONDITIONAL ENTROPY SCORE WHICH JUST CHECKS HOW MUCH INFORMATION
THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONE WORD TELLS YOU ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT WORD
BUT THAT'S A RELATIVELY GOOD MEASURE OF WHETHER THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC WORD
IN WHICH CASE THEY ARE USUALLY WORDS WHICH TELL YOU QUITE A LOT OR A VERY GENERAL WORD WHICH USUALLY DOESN'T TELL YOU QUITE A LOT
UM IT IT'S BASICALLY THE IT'S THE STANDARD ENTROPY FORMULA
AND YOU SORT OF YOU YOU
YES YES IT HAS
I MEAN
I THINK THE OFFICIAL LE SORT OF THE OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT TELLS YOU IS UM HOW MUCH THAT LIKE THE FACT THAT A GIVEN WORD OCCURS TELLS YOU ABOUT WHAT'S THE NEXT WORD'S GONNA BE
WHICH DOESN'T SOUND TOO EXCITING
BUT IT IT JUST WORKS OUT IN THE WAY THAT WORDS WHICH ARE PROMISCUOUS AND WHICH OCCUR WITH EVERYTHING ALL OVER THE PLACE HAVE VERY LOW A SCORES ON THAT
AND ALSO USUALLY END UP BEING THE WORDS WHICH ARE P
LEAST LIKE EXPRESSIVE AND L CONTAIN LESS INFORMATION
YEAH FUNCTION WORDS OR JUST VERY GENERAL NOUNS
PR PROBABLY LIKE WHAT WHATEV FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD COMPUTER IN THAT CONTEXT
YOU COULD IMAGINE IT TO F LIKE BE IN ALL IN ALL THE CONTEXTS
YEAH SO WE WOULD WE W WOULDN'T DO IT BY WORD WE WOULD SORRY OKAY
UM I WAS I WAS GETTING THAT W ACTUALLY SORRY I WAS GETTING THAT WRONG I WAS GETTING IT FROM WHAT I DID MY PROJECT
NOW IN THIS CASE WE WOULD DO IT BY PER MEE WORDS PER MEETING
SO
HMM
YES IT IT'S PROBABLY DOING IT'S PROBABLY DOING QUITE THE SAME THING IN THE END
BUT I'M JUST SAYING LIKE WITH THAT THING YOU WOULD EASILY HAVE AN ALGORITHM WHICH AT THE MOMENT PROVIDES YOU FOR EACH WORD WITH A SCORE WHICH WE CAN USE
UM NO UM I WAS I WAS I WAS DESCRIBING THE WRONG THING
IN THIS CASE WE WOULDN'T BE DOING HOW MUCH IT TELLS YOU ABOUT ANOTHER WORD
IN THIS CASE WE WOULD BE DOING GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW A WORD HOW GOOD IS IT AT PREDICTING FROM WHICH UM SPECIFIC TOPIC THAT WAS
SO THAT WOULD YEAH IN THAT SENSE IT'S THE SAME THING HERE
YEAH YEAH FOR A SPECIFIC
YEAH
THE SAME WORD THE WORD YESTERDAY WOULD BE WOULD HAVE THE SAME SCORE ALL OVER THE PLACE
OKAY
I C
BUT BUT YOUR CATEGORY THING DEPENDS ON THAT WE NOT JUST HAVE TOPIC SEGMENTS BUT ALSO THAT THESE TOPIC SEGMENTS WE HAVE THEM IN CATEGORIES
YOU YOU DO WOULDN'T YOU NEED SEVERAL DOCUMENTS FOR EACH CATEGORY
OR SEVERAL SEGMENTS FOR EACH CATEGORY
DO BUT WILL IT WORD WITHOUT THAT AT ALL
'CAUSE
YEAH I MEAN S SO IN OUR CASE BASICALLY EVERY
EVERY S TOPIC WOULD BE ITS OWN CATEGORY
AND THE QUESTION IS DOES THE ALGORITHM STILL MAKE ANY SENSE IN THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ALGORITHM ENOUGH FOR THAT
BUT WHAT I'M REALLY LIKE BECAUSE THE ENTROPICAL UM CALCULATION IS SO SIMPLE MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK INTO MAKING THAT SCORE JUST AS A PRELIMINARY SCORE THAT WE HAVE
LIKE IT IT'S A VERY IT GIVES YOU LIKE I'VE LOOKED AT THE RESULT
IT GIVES YOU BASICALLY SOMETHING IN THE END WHICH VAGUELY TELLS YOU JUST WHETHER A WORD IS A VERY SPECIFIC WORD
OR A VERY GENERAL WORD
AND
I LIKE THERE IS SOME HOPE THAT PROBABLY HAVING JUST SENTENCES WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF VERY SPECIFIC WORDS
IF YOU MARK THEM AS BEING MORE INTERESTING THAN THE WORDS WHICH ARE ONLY VERY GENERAL WORDS THAT THEY WOULD GET US SOMEWHERE
PROBABLY ONE POINT ZERO IS VERY HIGH INFORMATION VALUE
YEAH 'CAUSE THIS WOULD
YEAH IN IN A SENSE I MEAN THIS IS A BIT LIKE THE WHAT LIKE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY OVER TOTAL FREQUENCY
MEASURE IT SORT OF JUST GOING BY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN EVERY SEQUENCE OF THE SAME
MM-HMM
WITHIN TH WITHIN THE TOPIC SO LIKE TOPIC WE HAD TO WHEN YOU SAY TOPIC
YOU MEAN LIKE JUST LIKE FROM FROM A BEGINNING TO END POINT LIKE WITHIN ONE MEETING THERE ARE SEVERAL TOPICS
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION ANYWHERE DO WE
BUT BUT YOU YOU ARE SEGMENTING
WELL I'M I'M DOING ONE ON SEGMENT SIMILARITY IN THE END YEAH
I'M DOING LIKE FINDING SIMILAR SEGMENTS BASIC LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
BUT
BUT LIKE F FOR NOW LIKE YOUR SEGMENTATION IS JUST SPLITTING A MEETING UP INTO DIFFERENT BLOCKS VER
NOT NOT FROM WHAT COLIN IS DOING FROM WHAT I NO
IT'S ONLY LIKE I'M WRITING AN ALGORITHM THAT WHICH THEN TRIES TO ALSO AGAIN BASED ON WORD P OCCURRENCE PATTERNS TRY TO LINK TOGETHER MAYBE DIFFERENT ONES OF THOSE
SO
SO THAT YEAH
YEAH I'M ALSO A BIT B LIKE I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE ABOUT RAINBOW BEING THE RIGHT THING
'CAUSE IT SEEMS THAT RAINBOW DOES IN ITS STRUCTURE QUITE RELY ON HAVING DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF THE SAME CATEGORY SORT OF IN IN A WAY
'KAY
YOU KNOW WHAT AS A BYPRODUCT OF MY L. S. A. I'LL PROVIDE UM A VOCABULARY LIKE SORT OF A DICTIONARY WHICH FOR EACH WORD GIVES AN ENTROPY SCORE ENTROPY SCORE
WHICH JUST TELLS YOU OF HOW MUCH INFORMATION THE PRESENCE OF A WORD TELLS YOU ABOUT WHICH TOPIC IT IS
NOT WHICH CATEGORY LIKE I'M NOT I'M NOT LUMPING TOGETHER SEPARATE TOPIC SEGMENTS INTO CATEGORIES
BUT JUST LIKE HOW MUCH THIS WORD TELLS YOU ABOUT WH HOW LIKELY THAT W THE OCCURRENCE OF THAT WORD MAKES IT THAT IT'S A SPECIFIC SEGMENT TOPIC SEGMENT
WHICH IS SOME MEASURE ALREADY OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS WORD IS VERSUS HOW SPECIFIC F TO A CERTAIN SEGMENT THAT IS
AND I'LL JUST PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT MUCH MORE WORK THAN JUST THE USUAL THING
AND THEN WE CAN SEE HOW WE CAN TIE THAT IN WITH THE OTHER STUFF
SO IF YOU UM KEEP ON WORKING ON RAINBOW MEANWHILE AND TRY TO FIND A WAY HOW TO TIE YOUR RAINBOW STUFF INTO
SOME WAY THAT WE CAN ATTACH IT TO A CERTAIN TIME SEGMENT
I'M JUST THINKING WH IF
IT IT USED IS EACH WORD COMPLETELY UNIQUE LIKE SORT OF DOES IT TREAT EACH WORD EACH OCCURRENCE OF WORD AS A COMPLETELY UNIQUE EVENT
OR DOES IT I MEAN NO IT IT HAS TO I MEAN BASICALLY THE THE FORM OF THE WORD IS IMPORTANT RIGHT
WE CAN'T JUST REPLACE THE WORD BY AN ARBITRARY STRING
BECAUSE IT LOOKS IF THE SAME WORD OCCURS AGAIN AND STUFF
YEAH IT IT HAS TO WORK WITH A M YEAH WELL I THINK IT'S A STUPID QUESTION
LIKE IT IT IT HAS TO WORK ON ON ON THE WORD LIKE ON
WHAT I WAS THINKING IS WHETHER IF WE REPLACE THE WORD BY SOMETHING UNIQUELY ID IDENTIFIABLE THEN IT WOULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENT WHICH ORDER IT IS
BUT THAT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT NEEDS THE WORD BECAUSE THAT'S ALL IT'S WORKING ON
IT'S THE WORD AND THAT LOOKS IF THAT WORD OCCURS AGAIN AND VERSUS HOW OFTEN THAT WORD OCCURS IN OTHER CONTEXT RIGHT
SO WE CAN'T ATTACH SOME TYPE OF INFORMATION TO THE WORD JUST TO THE WORD STRING ITSELF
LIKE MAKING AN UNDERSCORE MAKING THE TIME OR SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T WORK
BUT WOULD IT HAVE THAT IN THE UNTRUNCATED VERSION THEN LIKE WOULD IT S WOULD THE OUTPUT BE THE UNTRUNCATED VERSION
IT WILL PROBABLY UM NO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD
YEAH FOR NOW I MEAN REALLY JUST LIKE
YEAH I THINK IF WE WORK TOGETHER ON AN ON AN ENTROPY BASED SCORE
IT'S LET ME SEE IF I CAN DEMONSTRATE
T I MEAN LET'S JUST KEEP ON TALKING MEANWHILE AND I'LL TRY TO START THAT UP
IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY D IT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING BUT IT IT BASICALLY JUST
DOES SOMETHING WHICH TELLS YOU HOW SPECIFIC A WORD IS
IN A SENSE IT'S IN A IT'S IT'S BASICALLY JUST TO TO A HIGH DEGREE REALLY TELLING YOU HOW R HOW RARE A WORD IS OR HOW COMMON A WORD IS
BUT UH AS AS THE FIRST STEP THAT'S PROBABLY FOR FOR A PROTOTYPE FOR NEXT WEEK THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A BAD THING I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S JUST THAT
EVEN IF YOU JUST LIKE IF YOU HAVE SEGMENTS WHERE WHERE LOTS OF RARE WORDS OCCUR HIGHLIGHTED IN DARKER RED THAN SEGMENTS WHERE ALL THE VERY COMMON WORDS OCCUR
THAT'S JUST THAT'S SOMEWHERE TO START FROM
AND IT'S IT'S A BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT BUT THEN DE FACTO IT JUST ENDS UP DOING THAT MOSTLY FROM WHAT I FIGURED OUT
UM
ACTUALLY I THINK I'M NOT GONNA NOT GONNA START THAT NOW BECAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE TOO LONG
SO
IF WE GET IT ON A WORD BY WORD BASIS WHATEVER YOU DO IT'LL PROBABLY APPEAR IN A WORD BY WORD BASIS
AND WHAT YOU HAVE ON A SORT OF SEGMENT BUT NOT QUITE SEGMENT BASE
'KAY WHAT ABOUT THE FOLLOWING MODEL
I MEAN THIS IS A VERY UNSCIENTIFIC WAY OF DOING IT IN SOME SENSE
BUT WHAT IF WE IF WE TAKE TIME AS THE STANDARD UNIT FOR NOW AND SORT OF LIKE MAKE A MASSIVE ONE SEGMENT SPLIT SUPER ARRAY
BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING CAN IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BE TI TIED DOWN TO ACTUAL TIME
SO IF WE IF WE IF FOR IF FOR EACH ONE SEGMENT TIME SLOT WE COULD ATTACH A VALUE
AND THEN IT WOULD BE EASY TO THEN GO BACK WHEN IF WE HAVE THE TIME MARKS HERE
AND RE MAP THAT ONTO ONTO THE LENGTH OF A SEGMENT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
SO IF YOU HAVE FOR EACH WORD SAY AND WE KNOW THAT WORD STARTS AT THIS SEGMENT AND ENDS AT THAT SEGMENT
AND YOU HAVE FOR LIKE FOR SOME TIME PERIOD W THE OVERLAP AND THAT PERIOD ON THE F. ONES AND THAT PERIOD OR SOMETHING
SO YOU ALSO HAVE A VALUE WHICH CAN BE TIED DOWN TO A TIME
AND THEN WE COULD JUST IN M IN MATLAB OR IN SOMETHING JUST CREATE SOME MASSIVE SUPER ARRAY OF
OF THINGS FOR EACH FOR EACH LIKE SORT OF TIME SAMPLING SLOT AND AND CALCULATE A VALUE FOR THIS AND ONCE WE HAVE THIS ARRAY
WE CAN GO WITH THE SCRIPT AND SORT OF GO FOR EACH SEGMENT TO THE STARTING AND END TIMES AND SAY OKAY
THIS IS FROM OUR TIME SEGMENT F HERE TO THIS TIME SEGMENT THERE
SO WE TAKE THE SOME OF THOSE AND DIVIDE THEM BY BY THE NUMBER OR SOMETHING CREATE THE AVERAGE AND PUT IT IN AS THE VALUE FOR THE SEGMENT
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
OH
THA THAT'S THAT'S A FIDDLING PLAY IN THE END BUT THAT PROBLEM WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A USEFUL WAY OF AUTOMATICALLY EVALUATING UM
WE DON'T HAVE A WAY OF USEFULLY EVALUATING AUTOMATICALLY WHAT'S GOOD AND WHAT'S BAD
SO IT'S IT'S PROBABLY ALWAYS GONNA BE A QUESTION OF LOOKING AT IT AND SAYING OKAY
LIKE RUNNING IT WITH DIFFERENT DIFFERENT FACTOR LOADINGS AND SEEING OKAY THIS WAY IT WORKS THIS WELL AND THIS WAY IT WORKS THAT WELL
BUT IT PROBABLY BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR MAPPED T TO MAP FOR YOU TO MAP IT ON SO FOR YOU SORT OF I
YEAH BUT SO YOU SAY THAT INST LIKE YOU BASICALLY SAY W HAVING AN ARRAY WHERE EACH EACH CELL IS IS ONE LIKE IS O IS ONE WORD
AND THEN YOU WOULD MAP YOUR INFORMATION ONTO INDIVIDUAL WORDS
HMM
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHICH WORD THAT IS AND
'KAY
AND AND THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE SOME TYPE OF JUST POINT IN THE END WHERE THE ONE SCORES FROM THE ALL THE INDIVIDUAL WORD CELLS GET MULTIPLIED ALL WITH LIKE FOR EACH UTTERANCE OR WHATEVER
YOU HAVE GET ALL MULTIPLIED WITH THE SAME VALUE ALL THE ONES THAT ARE WITHIN THAT UTTERANCE
THAT'S SORT OF THE COMBINATION OF OF THE TWO SCORES
AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK AGAIN AND THEN PUT THAT BACK INTO THAT SEGMENT MODE HERE
SO THAT WE BECAUSE IN THE END WE DON'T WANT IT ON A PER WORD BASIS BUT PROBABLY ON A PER SEGMENT BASE
OH YEAH YEAH ACTUALLY THAT YEAH THAT'S TRUE SO THAT IT'S EASIER IF YOU
ARE ABLE TO YEAH WELL I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BACK WHERE WE STARTED AT THIS
BUT YOU SAID IT WI BUT YOU SAID IT'S MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOUR SEGMENTS AREN'T THOSE SEGMENTS EXACTLY
HMM
AND THEIR SEGMENTS DO OVERLAP
UH THE THO THOSE DO OR THOSE DON'T
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO YOU COULD ON THEIR GRANULARITY YOU COULD ON THEIR GRANULARITY CREATE A SCORE LIKE FOR EACH FOR EACH OF THEIR SEGMENTS
WELL I GUESS I MEAN FOR YOU IF YOU KNOW FOR EACH WORD IF YOU FIND THAT OUT THEN IT HAS TO BE POSSIBLE
BECAUSE IF WE KNOW SORT OF THIS IS GOING FROM WORD TO WORD OR IT THIS IS GOING FROM TIME TO TIME AND THEN THERE HAS TO BE A WAY THEN FOR YOU SAY OKAY
THIS CONCERNS THESE FOLLOWING WORDS AND THEN JUST MAKE MAKE A SIMPLE MEAN OVER THEM
I THINK AN INTERESTING THING IS IF WE DON'T COMBINE YOUR TWO SCORES IN THE
IN THE X. M. L. FILE YOU HAD BUT IF WE DO THAT IN THE SOFTWARE
THEN WE CAN PROBABLY MAKE WAYS OF PLAYING WITH IT IN THE SOFTWARE AND SORT OF L YOU KNOW LIKE ADAPTING SOME SORT OF CONTROL
LIKE PLAYING AROUND WITH LOOK LIKE IT'S PLAYING WITH DIFFERENT WEIGHTINGS FOR THAT THE UTTERANCE BASED ONE VERSUS THE WORD BASED ONE AND SORT OF LOOK AT IT DYNAMICALLY
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
LIKE PLAYING AROUND SORT OF FIGURING OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY OF COMBINING THEM BY PLAYING AROUND AND LOOKING AT THE RESULTS
YEAH
YEAH WE COULD PROBABLY LIKE MAKE A UH UM GRAPHIC DISPLAY INITIALLY AT LEAST FOR OUR EXPERIMENTING
WE'D JUST PLACE THEM IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEN SEE HOW THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER
OKAY
YEAH
SO DO YOU THINK Y LIKE BOTH OF YOU THEN CAN MAP SOMETHING ONTO THEIR SEGMENTS LIKE JUST EACH OF YOU PROVIDE ONE VALUE
LIKE DOUBLE VALUE OR WHATEVER LIKE ONE DECIMAL VALUE OR WHATEVER ONTO ONTO EXACTLY THEIR SEGMENTS
IT'S STATED BOTH IN
IT'S DONE BOTH IN TERMS OF WORDS AND IN TERMS OF SEGMENTS
IT'S A BIT SAD SORT OF THAT WE DO THIS BEFORE WE'VE TRULY FIGURED OUT HOW THE NITE X. M. L. THING WORKS
BECAUSE NOW WE'RE DOING IT ALL BY HAND AND LIKE PARSING AND UN PARSING THAT THING AND IT'S IT'S ALL PART OF THE FRAMEWORK
UH
HOW MUCH EASIER WOULD IT BE IF WE TRULY UNDERSTOOD THIS
SO
'KAY
I MIGHT JUST CHANGE MY ORDER OF IN WHICH I DO THINGS AND LIKE FORGET MY LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS STUFF UNTIL THE WEEKEND AND TRY TO REALLY MAKE SENSE OF THE
OF THE NITE DATA SYSTEM NOW SO THAT MAYBE AS SOON AS I'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE FIND WAYS OF DOING THAT IN WITHIN THE NITE FRAMEWORK ALREADY
SO THAT WE DON'T MANUALLY HAVE TO PARSE TIMES AND ENTIRE THINGS TOGETHER
WELL
AT THE MOMENT WHAT YOU WOULD DO LIKE TO TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS YOU WOULD SORT OF LIKE WRITE SOME PERL SCRIPT OR SOMETHING THAT GETS THIS TIME VALUE OUT OF HERE AND
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO PROVIDED THAT YOU GET YOUR WORDS IN THE RIGHT ORDER
DO YOU THINK IT IS AN EASY TASK FOR YOU TO IT IT'S A F RELATIVELY FEASIBLE TASK FOR YOU TO TO GET JUST A SINGLE VALUE PER SEGMENT
OKAY
AND YOU SAY YOU THINK YOU'RE ABLE AS WELL TO MAP ONTO THOSE SEGMENTS
AND IF YOU'RE BOTH ABLE TO MAP INTO THOSE SEGMENTS THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ONE FILE WHERE WE HAVE LIKE WHATEVER TWO VALUES
VALUE A. AND VALUE B. BOTH AS ATTRIBUTES FOR
FOR THIS
AND THAT WE COULD LOAD INTO A PROTOTYPE AND SEE WHAT TYPES OF DISP WHAT WAYS OF DISPLAYING THIS INFORMATION ARE THERE
HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
THERE'S PROBABLY ALSO SOCIAL INTERACTION FACTORS IN THAT THERE'S SOMETIMES JUST A MEETING LIKE IF PEOPLE ADAPT THEIR F. ZERO TO EACH OTHER THEN THEY'RE SOMETIMES P
YEAH
CAN YOU NOT DO SOMETHING LIKE JUST LIKE NOT MEASURING THE F. ZERO OR THE AMPLITUDE AT ALL
BUT JUST LIKE THE VARIANCE OF F. ZERO WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME AND LIKE SORT OF LIKE JUST HAVE SOME PART FOR ITS VERY LOW VARIANCE WITH MORE THE SAME F. ZERO AND ONE WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF MORE VARIANCE
I DON'T WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT AT ALL
YEAH
SORRY
MM
HMM
OKAY
SO AT THE MOMENT YOU YOU JUST YOU MEASURING THE F. ZEROS RELATIVE TO THE AVERAGE FOR THE SPEAKER OR
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RI SO THE AVERAGE
OKAY
UM SO WHAT YOU WOULD BE FEEDING IN WOULD BE JUST LIKE ONE VALUE PER SPEAKER PER MEETING
SO THAT OKA THAT THAT'S THAT'S YOUR AVERAGE BASELINE OKAY OKAY
NO YEAH THAT THAT MAKES M YEAH THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE YEAH
SO THAT WOULD SHOW YOU HOW MUCH RELATIVE TO HOW HE SORT OF HOW HE'S PERFORMING GENERALLY IN THAT MEETING RELATIVE TO THAT HOW HE'S IN A SPECIFIC SEGMENT
HE OR SHE
YEAH
YEAH
AND FOR YOU THAT WOULD BE QUITE EASY TO TRANSLATE INTO THOSE SEGMENTS
YEAH GUESS I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION FIFTEEN TIMES NOW
SORRY
UH
HMM
OH THEY W THEY DO EXIST
THE CASTRATI CORPS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTITUTE
OH WELL
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO GO SOON
BUT NOT QUITE SURE I MEAN IS THERE ANYTHING MORE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ANYWAY
YEAH
SEE AS SOON AS AS SOON AS I'M HALFWAY THROUGH MY L. S. A. LIKE BASICALLY AS SOON AS I HAVE THE THE MATRIX BUILT
IF OF THE DOCUMENT BY WORD STUFF IT'S VERY EASY TO THEN CALCULATE FOR EACH WORD A SCORE
AND I CAN JUST GIVE YOU THOSE SCORES AND YOU CAN DO WITH THEM WHATEVER YOU WANT
YEAH I THINK COLIN DAVE AND ME WILL ACTUALLY WORK ON ON THE JAVA STUFF
AND IT AND WE'LL JUST SEE WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU SUPPLY US WE'LL TRY TO TIE IN AND VISUALISE IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER
UM I'LL ASK JONATHAN IF WE CAN POSTPONE THE MEETING TO ONE O'CLOCK
SO THAT WOULD GIVE US A CHANCE OF MEETING IN FOR AN HOUR BEFORE THAT TO DISCUSS THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD
YEAH I HAVEN'T GOTTEN LIKE SORT OF MY CONFIRMATION THAT W WEDNESDAY IS FINE
I'M NOT SURE IF I'M SUPPOSED TO EXPECT A CONFIRMATION FOR MY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM NOW OR BUT I'LL JUST EMAIL HIM AGAIN AND S ASK HIM IF WE CAN MAYBE MAKE IT ONE SORRY
WE SAID TWELVE AND I'M ASKING IF HE CAN MAKE ONE
THIS IS A BIT FRUSTRATING AT THE MOMENT THIS PROJECT ISN'T IT
IT'S SO LIKE DIFFICULT TO TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU UNDERSTAND ENOUGH TO REALLY FEEL THAT
I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT FEELING THAT I'M REALLY WORKING AT THE MOMENT I'M MORE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF EVERYTHING
AND IT'S A BIT TOO FAR INTO THE MEETING FOR THAT AND INTO THE PROJECT FOR THAT
HMM
I GUESS AS SOON AS WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK IN THE W IN THE TYPE OF THE PROTOTYPE WHERE LIKE SORT OF EACH OF US CAN TIE IN THEIR STUFF AND SEE WHAT IT L HOW HOW IT LOOKS LIKE AND HOW IT PERFORMS
YOU KNOW
THAT PROBABLY MAKES IT A LOT EASIER THEN BUT IT'S SORT OF IT'S A BOOT STRAPPING PROBLEM LIKE FOR THE PROTOTYPE WE NEED SOME TYPE OF DATA
BUT TO DEVELOP THE DATA IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO TO HAVE THE PROTOTYPE
ANYWAY I GOTTA GO
HMM
YES BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S IN A FORM WHICH IS EASY TO READ IN AT THE MOMENT THAT WOULD BE FINE
SORT OF LIKE IF BASICALLY IF WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS SEGMENTS FILE BUT FOR EACH OF YOU LIKE JUST HAVE ONE ATTRIBUTE
I THINK IT'S REALLY EASY IF WE DON'T MERGE THEM BEFORE HAND BUT IF WE LET THEM IF WE COMBINE THEM IN THE PROTOTYPE OR DON'T AT THE MOMENT
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN EASILY D DISPLAY THEM INDIVIDUALLY C CONTRAST THEM TO EACH OTHER AND PLAY AROUND WITH HOW Y TO COMBINE THEM
EXACTLY YEAH
YEAH
AND I MEAN COMPUTATIONALLY MULTIPLYING TWO INTEGERS OR DOUBLES OR WHATEVER SHOULDN'T BE THE THING THAT SLOWS US DOWN
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH
YOU YOU HAVE THIS GOING BEHIND YOUR EARS THE YEAH
YEAH
HMM
NO
JUST MAYBE TALK ABOUT UM HOW YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR DATA FILE
YEAH
THAT'S UM THE INTERFACE BETWEEN HAVING THE TOPIC SEGMENTS AND CALCULATING THE UH INFORMATION IMPORTANCE OF WORDS
YEAH
SO I I WOULD NEED SEPARATE FILES FOR EACH SEGMENT OR JUST MAYBE HAVE DELIMITERS INBETWEEN EACH SEGMENT
OKAY YEAH AND Y THEN I CAN MAKE FILES OF THAT
ALRIGHT
NO I DON'T KNO KNOW IT NO
YEAH THAT'S FINE
I JUST I JUST NEED A A TITLE FOR THE FILE BUT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS
MM
SO UH WE HAVE THEN WHEN WE ARE MIXING OUR UM VALUES TOGETHER IS IT UM A VALUE FOR EACH UM EXPRESSION FOR EACH SENTENCE OR SOMETHING
YEAH
MM MM
YEAH
YEAH I WOULD JUST END UP WITH UH VALUES FOR EACH WORD SO I WOULDN'T HAVE UM
ANY BOUNDARIES FOR SEGMENTS AT ALL
I JUST I JUST WOULD HAVE THE WORDS AND THEN HOW WE UM HOW LONG EACH EXPRESSION WOULD BE I DON'T KNOW
YEAH BUT WHAT IS AN UTTERANCE
UH YEAH
OKAY
SO WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD FIT IN INTO THE XML FILES WOULD IT BE UH UM A VALUE FOR EACH UTTERANCE
OR WHAT YOU
OKAY
MM-HMM
SO THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO FIT IN MORE THAN JUST ONE WHERE VALUES UM
YEAH
BUT UM
MM UH-HUH
YEAH IT'S BETTER
SO WE N WOULD NEED A VALUE LABEL FOR EACH OF THOSE SEGMENTS THAT ARE NOT DIALOGUE ACTS
FOR ALL THOSE THAT POINT TO THE ACTUAL WORDS
YEAH THAT'S THERE
NO ABOVE
YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU MEAN AN A AN ATTRIBUTE
YEAH
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIEST TO JUST INCORPORATE A NEW ATTRIBUTE IN IN THIS FILE
YEAH I DON'T KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY NOT VERY UH NICE BUT WOULD QUITE EASY WOULDN'T IT
YEAH
BUT THEY DISPLAY THE SEGMENTS IN OR THAT THE UTTERANCES I IN THEIR UM
USER INTERFACE AS WELL WHERE THE WORDS ARE Y UM DISPLAYED
SO SO THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR UTTERANCES DISPLAYED IN THEIR INTERFACE
SO THAT'S THEY UM ACCESS PROBABLY THIS FILE AND THEN THEY DISPLAY THE WORDS
SO WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE ABLE TO DO THAT
UH
YEAH THE PROBLEM IS PROBABLY THAT UM I EXTRACT ALL THE WORDS AND THEN UH I DON'T UM USE AN I. D. OR SOMETHING FOR IT
SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO WRITE IT BACK TO THE RIGHT POSITION
IT DEPENDS ON THE POSITION I THINK
YEAH
YEAH I I COULD USE ANOTHER A DIFFERENT APPROACH THOUGH
IT
MM YEAH
MM-HMM
UM WOULD YOU THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO JUST TAKE UM FILE FILES BY SPEAKER
IT'S IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT INPUT I GIVE TO UM TO RAINBOW
SO I JUST COULD G USE THE FILES AS THEY ARE
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THAT WOULD GIVE AN OUTPUT
I DON'T KNOW
NO IT UM I THINK IT'S NOT UH VERSUS THE WHOLE CORPUS
IT'S UM YOU HAVE CERTAIN CATEGORIES AND YOU MEASURE WHICH WORDS UM HAVE THE HIGHEST INFORMATION FOR ONE CATEGORY
SO IT'S THE CATEGORIES ACROSS EACH OTHER I THINK
UM PROBABLY YEAH
BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S S STRANGE
YEAH
YEAH BUT WHAT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
I THINK THE INFORMATION GAIN IN RAINBOW IS ORDERED BY THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION GAIN
NOT I AM NOT SURE IF I CAN GET THE RIGHT ORDER AND THE VALUES
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
BUT I UM IF THE ORDER STAYS THE SAME IT'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL TO I JUST WRITE BACK AGAIN
BUT IF UH IT'S ORDERED BY INFORMATION GAIN I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WORDS COME FROM BECAUSE IT'S IT HAS A BAG OF WORDS REPRESENTATION
UH YES
IS IT IS
IT WAS MADE FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION
YEAH THAT'S THE PROBLEM
YEAH UM WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IS THAT YOU YOU PUT IN SOME DOCUMENTS AND YOU HAVE SEVERAL DOCUMENTS PER CATEGORY
UM AND YOU HAVE SEVERAL CATEGORIES
AND THEN IT MEASURES UM WHICH WORDS ARE TYPICAL FOR A CERTAIN T CATEGORY
AND IF YOU GET A NEW DOCUMENT IT WILL UM COMPARE WHICH WORDS ARE IN THAT NEW DOCUMENT
AND IF THERE ARE A LOT OF WORDS THAT UM ARE TYPICAL FOR ONE CATEGORY
IT WILL ASSIGN IT TO THAT CATEGORY AND IF IT'S TYPICAL FOR ANOTHER ONE IT WILL ASSIGN IT TO THAT ONE
YEAH IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE UM Y UM YOU HAVE UM OTH DIFFERENT FILES
IF IF THIS IS YOUR DIRECTORY YOU HAVE UM UM A DIAGRA UM A DIRECTORY ONE TWO AND THREE
AND THIS REPRESENTS THE CATEGORY
EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THERE IS IN CATEGORY ONE
A
YEAH JUST SPLIT IT UP SOMEHOW YEAH
YEAH
NO I'VE JUST UM SPLIT THEM UP UH SOMEHOW UM BY UM THERE ARE SEVERAL DOCUMENTS FOR
UM EACH MEETING AND I JUST PUT ONE IN EACH CATEGORY
SO UH IT'S IT'S NOT VERY SENSIBLE AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE I'M WAITING FOR THE UM TOPIC SEGMENTS OR I'M JUST YEAH
YEAH YEAH PROBABLY
YEAH MAYBE IT'S IT'S BETTER IF I WRITE IT MYSELF BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S TOO EASY TO JUST SPLIT THINGS UP INTO BINS
AND IT IT WOULDN'T BE ANY WORK AT ALL IN TERMS OF PROGRAMMING OR SOMETHING
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HOW DOES IT CALCULATE THAT ACTUALLY
OKAY
YEAH BUT THAT'S THE SA UH ALMOST I THINK SIMILAR TO WHAT I'M DOING BECAUSE WORDS THAT ARE IN EVERY CLASS
THAT ARE NOT VERY INFORMATIVE BUT WORDS THAT ARE ONLY IN ONE CLASS ARE ARE VERY INFORMATIVE FOR THAT CLASS
OH OKAY
ALRIGHT
YEAH THAT'S TH YEAH
FOR A SPECIFIC WORD PER
PER
ALL OVER THE PLACE
AND IN MY CASE IT WOULD HAVE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT UH VALUES FOR EACH CATEGORY
BUT IN THAT CATEGORY IT WOULD HAVE THE SAME VALUE AT EACH PLACE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
UM THAT WOULD BE BEST BUT I I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK IF THAT
UM AT LEAST IT WORKS IF THERE ARE SEVERAL CATEGORIES WITH EACH WITH ONE DOCUMENT EACH BUT IT UM YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THE QUESTIO YEAH I DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
MM OKAY
OH NO I LI I TH I THOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE D UM WE JUST SPLIT I NEED SOMEWHERE TO SPLIT
AND THAT UM SPLITTING AT CATEGORY BOUNDARIES UM SPLITTING AT TOPIC BOUNDARIES WOULD A NICE THING TO DO RATHER THAN JUST SPLITTING SOMEWHERE
SO YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT IT I THINK IT SHOULD WORK FOR JUST ONE DOCUMENT BECAUSE IT IT COMPARES BETWEEN THE CATEGORIES
AND IF YOU JUST HAVE ONE DOCUMENT UM IT STILL CAN FIND OUT WHICH WORDS ARE INFORMATIVE FOR THAT CATEGORY AND WHICH ARE NOT
SO IF YOU HAVE JUST ONE DOCUMENT IN EACH CATEGORY AND THERE ARE A LOT OF UM OCCURRENCES OF THE WORD THE IN EACH ONE
SO THIS WORD WILL BE NOT VERY INFORMATIVE ACROSS THE CATEGORIES
SO IT SHOULD WORK FOR ONE BUT I'M NOT SURE IF HOW EXACTLY IT IT UM CALCULATES EVERYTHING
UH I THINK IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO LOOK THAT UP
YEAH MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE A LIST THAT IT'S O THAT IS ORDERED BY
YEAH DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
IT'S UH
MM-HMM
OH RIGHT
MM
ALRIGHT
YEAH YOU YOU CAN USE UM
SOME KIND OF UM TRUNCATION MAYBE IF YOU ATTACH A NUMBER TO EACH WORD AND SAY THAT IT SHOULD OMIT THE LAST PART
UH PROBABLY NOT
NO NO
YEAH MAYBE I SHOULD TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND JUST PROGRAMME IT FOR MYSELF
BECAUSE UM
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT HOW CAN WE GET TO KNOW WHAT MAKES SENSE AS A A FUNCTION FOR JOINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO FIND THAT OUT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU YOU COULD ALWAYS FIND OUT HOW MANY WORDS THERE ARE IN AN UTTERANCE COULDN'T YOU
YEAH
SO
FOR EXAMPLE
MM
SO BUT
MM
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH THEN WE SH YEAH
WE COULD EVEN YEAH WE COULD EVEN HAVE A LOOK AT OUR DIFFERENT MEASURES IF THEY UM
COME UP WITH THE SAME SAME KINDS OF YEAH
UH I THINK IF I CAN PROVIDE SOMETHING FOR THE WORDS AS THEY ARE
IT'S STATED FROM WHERE TO WHERE THE SEGMENTS GO
IT SHOULD BE UH SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
YEAH SO IT MUST SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU MEAN BY MATCHING STRINGS
OR WHAT
YEAH BUT WHAT I'VE DONE IS UM A PARSER AN X. M. L. PARSER WHERE YOU CAN GET THE START TIMES
SO YEAH THAT'S QUITE EASY BECAUSE IT'S IT'S AN ATTRIBUTE AND YOU JUST S SAY THAT YOU WANT THE VALUES OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES ME
BUT
MM
IS LAUGHTER ANNOTATED AT ALL
BECAUSE YOU COULD TAKE THAT ON OURS OUT MAYBE
IF YOU TAKE THE LAUGHTER OUT AND THEN CALCULATE IT
MM
YEAH
NOT THE MOMENT
MAYBE IF WE MEET AT THE WEEKEND
OH I DON'T KNOW
YEP
SO UH NO HOW ABOUT THE THE PROTOTYPE
IF WE WANT TO SHOW HIM SOMETHING ON MONDAY WE DEFINITE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER
SOME OF US AT LEAST HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET IT RUNNING PROBABLY
ALRIGHT
YEAH ME TOO
YEAH AND ALSO WE DON'T HAVE TO RECALCULATE IF JUST ONE
OKAY
LOOK'S GOOD
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S TRUE I THINK
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH TO TALK ABOUT I DON'T THINK
YEAH
YES WE CAN DO THAT
ALRIGHT
YEAH WELL THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS
IT'S GOT DELIMITERS IN BETWEEN THE MAR THE BOUNDARIES
BUT
YEAH IF YOU'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT YEAH
AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEED A A LABEL FOR EACH SEGMENT
BUT I MEAN THE MOST I CA YOU DON'T NEED A ONE
WELL I COULD GIVE YOU AN I. D. BUT IT'D BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY GIVE A TOPIC A TITLE
RIGHT
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S NO PROBLEM
HMM
MM
UM IS IT NOT SEGMENTS
OR IS IT DIALOGUE ACT DIALOGUE ACTS
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S IT YEAH
YEAH THEY'VE ALL GOT AN I. D. FOR EACH UTTERANCE
YEAH AND IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT UH FILE FOR EACH SPEAKER
N NO IT JUST POINTS TO THE TO THE WORDS
YEAH YEAH
THE I SUPPOSE SO THE UTTERANCES
BUT ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE LIKE
YEAH THINK SO
MM
YEAH CAN YOU NOT JUST LEAVES THOSE LINES BLANK
OH ALRIGHT
OKAY
HMM
YEAH WHAT DID YOU USE TO MAKE THAT FILE
JUST IN PERL
YOU DIDN'T USE AN X. M. L. PARSER
OKAY
HMM
HMM
HMM
WELL LIKE FUNCTION WORDS AND STUFF
MM
HMM
WELL UM WHEN IT SPLITS THE TOPICS UP IT DOES DO IT ON REGULAR WORDS THAT UM THAT OCCUR
BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE NO
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN'T REALLY GET ANY OTHER OUTPUT
NO
NO
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S SUPPOSED TO SPLIT IT INTO CU COHERENT TOPICS WITH THE SIMILAR INFORMATION
HMM
HMM
YEAH
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
YEAH
OH I'M SURE IT'D BE QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD SOME OF THE TASKS WE HAVE TO DO
BUT YET NO ONE REALLY UNDERSTANDS THEM THE ACTUAL X. M. L. PARSING
HMM
YEAH THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN IDEA
YEAH
YEAH JUST SEND US AN EMAIL AND TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING
RIGHT
AH YEAH
MM-HMM
SO UH WHICH VERSION OF MY DATA WAS THAT THE VERY FIRST ONE
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH V I MEAN REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF I'M JUST
YEAH
YEAH PROBABLY
PROBABLY ALL THESE UH-HUHS AND UH HMMS ARE SPELLED DIFFERENTLY IN THE THING OR WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
YOU SHOULD GENERALISE
AH HA
THAT'S A VERY OLD ONE RATHER
I THINK THOSE S. S AND E. S AND SO ON THE SINGLE LETTERS ARE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WITH MY UM FIRST VERSION OF THE TEXT THING
'CAUSE I THINK THE
HMM
YEAH BUT BUT PERHAPS MORE THAN HALF
OTHERWISE YOU GO IN TOO SLOWLY YEAH
UM UH SORRY THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE FIRST MEETING IS FOR EX THAT THERE'S NO UM A HOT SPOT ANNOTATION FOR THAT
BUT I MEAN THAT'S NOT NOT A REAL PROBLEM
M
I UH THINK IT MIGHT
WHY BECAUSE UM I UM STEVE LAY QUITE A LOT OF UM WEIGHT ON UM YOU KNOW UH SURFING THROUGH MEETINGS
SO WE SHOULD AT LEAST PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF DIFFERENT MEETINGS OF ONE GROUP
AT THE BEGINNING HE UM TALKED QUITE A LOT ABOUT THAT
UM AND WHAT ABOUT THE SIMILARITY MEASURE FOR SEGMENTS
DO WE UM ALSO PRESENT THAT IN THIS WINDOW AND DO WE DO IT ACROSS MEETINGS
UH I THINK THAT WAS PLANNED AT THE BEGINNING WASN'T IT
YEAH
UH OKAY
SO IT WOULDN'T BE DISPLAYED IN IN THE UH GRAPHICAL DISPLAY
OH
UM NO
I I'M JUST COMING BACK TO OUR INITIAL IDEA OF PRESENTING SOME YOU KNOW
ALL THE SIMILAR SEGMENTS IN UH ACROSS MEETINGS AND SEPARATING BY UH SOME THINGS LIKE
MM-HMM
OH I I HAVE THAT FILE
SO JUST
DID YOU OVERTAKE THAT CODE FROM THE ORIGINAL THING
YEAH BUT ALSO SPEEDING UP THE AUDIOS AND S
UM WHERE WE HAVE A MOVING BAND THE GRAPHICAL DISPLAY THAT ALSO MOVES ACCORDING TO THE
YEAH
UH F I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I CAN UH ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO IMPROVE THERE
SO I MEAN IF YOU NEED ME TO WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE UM I CAN TRY TO FINISH MY STUFF UM EARLY
BUT UM OTHERWISE I CAN STILL KEEP WORKING ON IT IMPROVING IT I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH TEN PERCENT
SO SO YOU WANT UM THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBERS TO BE UM CONTINUOUS THROUGHOUT THE CORPUS SO THAT SECOND MEETINGS BEGINS WITH THREE HUNDRED UM SOMETHING
COULDN'T WE COULDN'T WE JUST UM TAKE THE UM A NAME EACH UM EACH DIALOGUE ACT UM MEETING DOT UM DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER
IT WOULD BE A LA LONGER NAME BUT
A PROBLEM UM YEAH
FOR EXAMPLE AS THERE ARE NOT UM F. ZERO VALUES FOR EVERY SPEAKER OR ON SOMETIMES NOT FOR EVERY MEETING UM HOW WILL I COUNT THAT UP
I MEAN
AH OKAY
AT THE MOMENT I DON'T EVEN GENERATE ANY DOCUMENT UH DOCUMENT FOR THOSE
BUT BECAUSE I MEAN IT'S NOT ZERO IT'S JUST A NOUN
HMM
BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE IF THAT JUST WOULDN'T BE PART OF IT THEN
THE
HMM
YEAH
YEAH BUT DO WE REALLY WANT DO DISPLAY THEM SEPARATELY BECAUSE THE USER WON'T OKAY FOR NOW FOR OUR S OKAY
YEAH BUT THEN THE USER WOULD HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT S W WAS WHAT AND WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE BLUE STRIPES AND WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE RED ONES
UH I THINK THAT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD IDEA
MM-HMM
OKAY
COULDN'T WE COULDN'T WE WRITE ONE PROGRAMME THAT CALCULATES ALL THE UM F FOR ALL OUR DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE THE UM A ABSOLUTE UM DIALOGUE ACT NUMBERS FOR THE MEETING
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT WE ALL PRODUCE THE NUMBERS FOR EACH MEETING SEPARATELY
YEAH BUT WE SHOULD ALL USE THE SAME PROGRAMME I THINK
WOULD PREVENT US FROM HAVING TOO MUCH MISTAKES IN IT
OR AT LEAST UH THE MISTAKES WOULD BE CONSISTENT
NO IT'S NOT REALLY DIFFICULT
IT'S JUST
YEAH I MEAN I CAN DO IT
I CAN READ IN THE DIFFERENT UM IMPORTANCE MEASURES AND THEN RE RE CALCULATE THE NUMBERS
MM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
NO I'M JUST LIKE SORT OF LIKE PREPARING PEOPLE FOR UM IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE REALLY NOTHING
IT LOOKS LIKE BASICALLY LESS THAN N TH THEIR STUFF
BUT ACTUALLY DAVE HAS WRITTEN A WHOLE UNDERLYING DIFFERENT STRUCTURE NOW AND IF WE HOOKED IT UP WITH MY DISPLAY
THEN WE SHOULD FAIRLY EASILY FROM NOW GET TO A STAGE WHERE WE CAN LIKE SELECT INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS AND CLICK ON THEM
THEN PLAY THAT PART IN A COMPRESSED WAY AND DISPLAY DENSITY INFORMATION
NOW AT THE MOMENT THE APPLICATION IS
YES SURE BUT SO AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE A DIALOGUE ACT WINDOW AND A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY W I'M NOT SURE
NO THE INTERESTING THING IS THE SOUND CAME WHEN I TRIED IT LAST TIME AFTER I I TRIGGERED OFF SOMETHING BY CLICKING ON SOMETHING
YEAH THERE SUDDENLY THEY COME
PROBABLY THEY'RE JUST SLOW AT LOADING
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE BUTTONS YET
SO AT THE MOMENT THE DISPLAY IS STILL DIS COUPLED FROM IT
IT'S LOADING YOUR DATA I'M NOT QUITE SURE IS THIS IT PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE VERA'S DATA FROM FROM THE LOOKS OF IT
YEAH THE SEGMENTS ARE MADE UP AT THE MOMENT BUT THE CODE'S THERE FOR INTEGRATING REAL SEGMENTS
AND THIS IS SUMMARISED BASED ON JUST VERA'S DATA AT THE MOMENT FROM SOME PART OF THE MEETING
SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT LOADING THE WHOLE THING AT THE MOMENT YET PROPERLY
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS IS SUMMARISED BASED ON I I REALISE I'M ALWAYS POINTING AT MY SCREEN AND YOU DON'T SEE
SO THIS STUFF IS SUMMARISED BASED ON ON THESE INTENSITY MEASURES
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE EXACT AUDIO RECORD FOR THIS
USUALLY SAY WE SHOULD HAVE JUST COPIED IT
SO JUST TO SHOW DAVE HAS PUT A UH MUSIC FILE IN THERE AND THE MUSIC FILE IS PLAYING WITHOUT GAPS
THAT'S BECAUSE THE WAY HOW WE HANDLE IT AT THE MOMENT IS THAT DAVE PREPARES AN AUDIO FILE
CREATES AN AUDIO FILE DYNAMICALLY FROM JUST THE CHUNKS THAT WE WANNA HAVE AND THAT RUNS IN SYNCH WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN THE
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHY I'M MAKING LOUD
IT'S JUST
SO WE SEE THAT RUNNING ALONG WITH PLAYING
OF THE MUSIC WE SEE THE THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE DIALOGUE ACTS
OKAY S
SO AND AND THAT ALREADY THIS PART HERE ALREADY IS DYNAMICALLY CREATED
UM SHALL I JUST LOAD IT WITH JASMINE'S DATA JUST TO SEE A DIFFERENT WHERE'S THE
QUITE OLD
YEAH WE WERE B LIKE DOING THIS WE WERE JUST CONCERNED WITH THE WHOLE STUFF
AND DAVE WHERE WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR
AM I LOOKING FOR IN DATA MANAGER
WHERE AM I LOOKING
OR IS IT F IS IT WHERE THE IS IT WHERE THE FILE NAMES ARE
IS IT HERE
IS IT UH SH IS IT HERE WHERE UM WORDS IMPORTANCE FILE
IN MY DISPLAY
UH LET ME T
I D
JUST
OKAY SO WH WHERE DID YOU SAY IN PROG
W YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS JUST ABOUT
ABOVE THAT
LIKE IN
IN THIS MAIN IN THIS ROUTINE
THERE IS SOMETHING READ IMPORTANCE WITH A ZERO AND THERE IS READ WORD IMPORTANCE WITH A ONE
SHALL I SWAP THOSE AROUND
HMM
WELL WHA WHA WHAT WHAT'S THE DIFFERE SO TH THIS IS REALL
YEAH
SHALL I JUST SWAP THE FILE NUMBERS AROUND FROM NOW
OR WOULD THAT CRASH ANYTHING
OH YEAH AND AND WE REALLY LEAVE A
MAYBE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHERE
MM
MM
SO YOU HAVE TIME THIS AFTERNOON
YEAH
SO HERE
SO THIS SHOWS IF WE SEE ANYTHING AT ALL THEN WE SEE AT THE MOMENT AT LEAST THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY BE UM HAVING A DIFFERENT SUMMARY
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING A DIFFERENT IM UM IMPORTANT MEASURE
SO YOU SEE THAT UM I IT DOES SOMETHING
LIKE AT THE MOMENT I THINK THIS WAS YEAH YEAH THAT'S AN OLD OLD OLD VERSION
SO IT SHOWS UM AND SO IF YOU IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE OLD VERSION HAPPENED
THEN YOU SEE IT MAKES SENSE THAT WORDS LIKE PROSODY JUST LIKE A SING IF THAT WAS THE ONLY UTTERANCE THEN THAT PROBABLY SCORED QUITE WELL AND STUFF
UM
WE HAVE TO GET THESE BUTTONS DAVE
YEAH
UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T GET THE THE BAR ON THE DISPLAY WORKING JUST YET
BUT THAT SHOULD BE A SMALL ISSUE
YEAH I KNOW THIS IS VERY OLD
WE JUST NEVER BOTHERED TO UPDATE THE STUFF BECAUSE WE WERE WORKING ON SO WE SEE THAT WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT DENSITY CURVE AS WELL FOR THIS ONE
AND
YEAH SO FROM HERE WE GO AND IT HOPEFULLY WON'T BE TOO DIFFICULT TO NOW FIRST OF ALL PUT THE RIGHT SEGMENTS IN
PUT A SLIDING BAR INTO THIS SO THAT PEOPLE SEE WHERE THEY ARE
SO I'M UH I'M I'M CONSTANTLY TOUCHING STUFF ON MY SCREEN I REALISE
AND AND THEN MAKE SELECTIONS BASED ON A SEGMENT
NOW WHAT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE IS WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR LIKE HOW THE SUMMARISER WORKS
SHOULD IT ALWAYS COMPRESS A SEGMENT TO A CONSTANT LENGTH THOUGH BY A CONSTANT FACTOR OF TIME
OR
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK SORT OF IF YOU KNOW IF IF THERE'S A CERTAIN DEGREE OF OF SUMMARISATION WHAT SHOULD BE THE CONSTANT
SO ALWAYS LIKE A
SO IT SHOULD ALWAYS WHATEVER REDUCE IT TO HALF THE ORIGINAL
'CAUSE AN AL LIKE AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW WOULD BE THAT
YEAH
YEAH WELL I GUESS THAT COULD BE UH ADAPTABLE
'CAUSE AN AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW WOULD BE THAT YOU COULD SORT OF MAKE IT THAT IT ALWAYS IS THE SAME LENGTH
SO IF YOU LIKE IF THE WHOLE MEETING IS SELECTED IT COMPRESSES THE WHOLE MEETING TO FIVE MINUTES
THEN IF ONE UM SEGMENT UH W ONE TOPIC IS SELECTED THEN IT PLAYS THIS WHOLE TOPIC IN FIVE MINUTES
BUT THAT'S SORT OF THAT GIVES PEOPLE A BIT LESS CONTROL OVER SO MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT INSTEAD THAT IT YEAH IT C IT YOU CAN SPEC
YEAH
WHAT'S THAT YOU DISCUSSED FOR TODAY THOUGH
WHAT'S THERE TO TALK ABOUT FOR TODAY
SHALL WE ABANDON THE WHOLE NOTION OF SEEING THE WHOLE M ONE WHOLE GROUP AS ONE SINGLE THING AND JUST WORK ON A P CERTAINLY FROM NOW ON PROBABLY FOR GOOD THAT MEANS
I MEAN
NO
DO WE HAVE EVERYTHING FOR THE SAME MEETING AT THE MOMENT
LIKE IS IT ARE YOU Y ARE YOU ALL WORKING ON THE SAME MEETING
OKAY
DID ANYONE EVER CHECK IF THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD MEETING LIKE OR F COMPARABLY TO OTHERS
'KAY
YEAH
'KAY
YEAH
NO
YEAH ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S ONLY DONE LIKE ONCE EVERY TIME THE SELECTION CHANGES RIGHT
SO EVEN IF YOU SORT OF EVEN IF YOU DO AN HOURGLASS AT THAT MOMENT AND YOU KNOW
EVEN IF IT PAUSES FOR TEN SECONDS WELL THAT'S TOUGH LUCK THEN
UH
THINK WE SHOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT IF IT TAKES QUITE SOME TIME THAT THAT THE CLOCK DOESN'T START BEFORE OR THAT THE AUDIO AND THE CLOCK ARE IN SYNCH SORT OF
SO TH
YEAH
YEAH
THERE'S A WAIT FOR COMMAND FOR AN EXTERNAL CA LIKE FOR AN EXTERNAL CALL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EXTERNAL THING IS FINISHED BECAUSE IN GENERAL LIKE THAT'S SORT OF RUNNING PARALLEL
I THINK
YEAH
I HAVE SOME CODE FOR SYSTEM CALLS LIKE THAT HANDLES THE IN AND THE OUTPUT IF YOU NEED SOME OF THAT
OKAY
OKAY COOL
UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO TALK ABOUT
WE HAVE
SEE THERE'S THERE'S ONE WEEK AFTER MY DISSERTATION
SO WE'RE F UH BEFORE THE PRESENTATION OF THE PROTOTYPE
WHICH I CAN WORK A LOT LOT LOT ON THIS
SO THAT'S GOOD
UM
YEAH WELL THE GRAPHIC DISPLAY WILL DEFINITELY HAVE MORE INFORMATION
UM IF WE'RE AT THE MOMENT ABANDONING ABANDONING THE CONCEPT OF DISPLAYING THE WHOLE SERIES OF MEETINGS JUST BECAUSE IT'S FOR US LIKE MORE BUREAUCRACY
MORE COMPLEXITY AND IT PROBABLY JUST WON'T GIVE US ANY BROWNIE POINTS IN THE PRESENTATION
OR DO YOU THINK IT WILL I MEAN DO YOU THI LIKE
I C
WE'RE
AS ONE MEETING YEAH
YEAH AND THEN MAYBE HAVE SOME BASIC INFORMATION
LIKE IF
YEAH
SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE DISPLAY THAT KNOWS WHERE MEETINGS PICKING IT OVER
AND OTHERWISE INTERNALLY WE TREAT IT LIKE SO WE HAVE CONTINUOUS I. D. S FOR THE SEGMENTS
YEAH THAT WORKS
YES BUT APART FROM THAT WE DON'T REALLY DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT AS IF IT WAS JUST ONE MEETING
YEAH I COMPLETELY AGREE
SO THE ONLY THING IT WOULD BE THAT THE DISPLAY GETS INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE AND DISPLAYS THEM AS HARD BOUNDARIES
UM
YEAH SO THE INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF MORE A SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY UM THAT SIMPLY THERE'S ONE BUTTON THAT SAYS FIND SIMILAR SEGMENTS
AND THEN IN THE SAME DISPLAY WHERE WE DISPLAY THE SEARCH RESULTS FROM THE SEARCH
WHA
WELL I'M NOT SO YOU THINK DISPLAYING UH LIKE AN INFORMATION ABOUT SIMILARITY TO THE SELECT UH LIKE TO A SELECTED MEETING IN TO A SELECTED SEGMENT IN THE OTHER SEGMENTS
NO NO I THINK THAT'S I REALLY DON'T WANNA DO THAT TO BE HONEST
UM IT WOULD BE NICE BUT LIKE JUST
YEAH BUT I IT IT SHOULD APPEAR AS A CONTINUOUS THING F FOR THE YEAH
BUT I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S WORTH MUCH BOTHER THOUGH
LIKE IF WE DO A S LIKE A SIMILARITY SEARCH
AND JUST LIKE YOU SAY FIND ME SIMILAR SEGMENTS AND THEN SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE A LIST AND YOU CLICK ON ONE OF THEM AND THEN YOU GO TO THAT SEGMENT
I THINK THAT'S QUITE USEFUL UM EVEN WITHOUT DISPLAYING THEM SORT OF DIS CONTINUOUSLY
WELL I WAS THINKING OF JUST LIKE REALLY JUST A M MORE OR LESS JUST IMAGINE THOSE ARE SEARCH RESULTS EACH LIKE EACH OF THEM SORT OF THEM SORT OF GIVING WHATEVER
WE SHOULD AIM TO GET SOME NAMES FOR SEGMENTS LIKE JUST SOME EXTRACTION OF SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CALL
AND IF IT'S JUST THE SINGLE HIGHEST UM IMPORTANCE MEASURE O PHRASE OF A SEGMENT SO THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DISPLAY FOR THEM
LIKE BASICALLY JUST A SUMMARISATION DOWN TO ONE SEGMENT
AND IT WOULD JUST BE A LIST LIKE THIS AND YOU CLICK ON ONE AND THEN W YOU THO YOU KNOW
THEN THE WHOLE BUREAUCRACY KICKS IN LIKE THIS GETS THE NOTA NOTIFICATION THIS GETS THE NOTIFICATION
AND THEN WE COULD LIKE WE COULD SORT OF USE THE SAME THING FOR UM YOURS AND MINE
BECAUSE YOURS WOULD SORT OF GIVE JUST THE SEGMENT I. D. S AND MINE WOULD GIVE THE START SEGMENT I. D. S
SO BASICALLY THIS DISPLAY WOULD HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT A SEGMENT WHERE SOMETHING STARTS
MAYBE SE WELL MAYBE ALSO SOMETHING WHERE SOMETHING ENDS LIKE FOR MINE AND SOME STRING THAT WE PASS TO DESCRIBE WHAT LIKE WHAT IT IS
YOU WAIT YOUR SEARCH WHAT WOULD IT RETURN
WOULD IT RETURN JUST THE SPECIFIC LIKE IT WOULD GO RIGHT TO THE UTTERANCE RIGHT
YEAH SURE SURE SURE
UM YEAH
SO IN IN YOUR CASE LIKE IT WOULD BASICALLY WOULD PROBABLY SAY THE UTTERANCE HERE OR AT LEAST SOME PART OF THE U YEAH
AND IN MY CASE IT WOULD SAY SOME NAME FOR THE SEGMENT AND THEN YOU WOULD JUST CLICK ON IT AND THEN LIKE THE WHOLE THING WOULD KICK IN
LIKE YOU C YOU CLICK ON IT AND AND THE SELECTION MOVES AND THE DISPLAY GOES TO THAT PART
YEAH
DO WE HAVE THEM WITH A SPEAKER AT THE MOMENT
OKAY COOL
JUST RANDOM SP
SO WHAT ABOUT
SO WHAT ABOUT A GENERAL LAYOUT LIKE THIS THAT WE HAVE HERE
THE DIALOGUE ACTS AND THERE THE PLAYER B AND HERE WE'D HAVE A SEARCH BUTTON AND THE SIMILARITY THING BUTTON
I MEAN WE CAN
AH GOOD QUESTION
UM
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK WE PROBABLY LIKE WE CAN LEAVE THOSE LIKE I. FRAMES AND JUST ARRANGE THEM SORT OF
YEAH
ALTERNATIVELY WE'LL HAVE LIKE THE WHOLE THING RUNNING ALREADY WHEN WE DO THE PRESENTATION AND WE JUST ARRANGE IT MANUALLY
MY C
UH APPARENTLY MICROSOFT SOMETIMES OR LIKE AT LEAST IN THE PAST THE DEMONSTRATIONS WHERE THEY JUST EXACTLY KNEW WHICH FIVE PERCENT OF THE SYSTEM WERE WORKING
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AS WELL
HAS ANYONE EVER SEEN ANYTHING FROM THE OTHER GROUP
THEY HAVE ALL AH
THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF SC SCARILY GOOD
IF ANYTHING WE BUILD IN A TIME BOMB THAT ONLY FAILS IF THE DATE IS THE DATE OF THE PRESENTATION
YES BECAUSE WE ARE NICE PEOPLE
DAVE THIS RATE THING DO WE HAVE ANY DIRECT CONTROL TO THAT
OR IS THAT JUST DIRECTLY CONTROLLING HOW FAST IT PLAYS AND SORT OF WE CAN ONLY
THAT'S A PITY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DOING SOMETHING
'KAY
UM DO YOU THINK IF WE OVERRIDE THEIR COMPONENT AND JUST OVERRIDE WHATEVER THE THE ACTION TO THAT SLIDE BAR IS
SO IF SO SOMETHING LIKE THEIR SKIPPING WOULD IT ACTUALLY CORPORATE WITH OUR SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT
WOULD OURS SKIP AUTOMATICALLY FORWARD
YEAH I REALISE
UH
YEAH WHATEVER
I THINK THIS SIMPLE THIS SIMPLE ST VIEW THAT WE GET THAT YOU CAN JUST LIKE PASS THINGS INTO AND THEN CHECK WHEN THEY GOT CLICKED REALLY
WELL COULDN'T THE SUMMAR OH NO THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO OVERRIDE THOUGH
HMM
BUT I IN A SENSE I MEAN IF WE SEE UH YEAH BUT LIKE PROBABLY THAT WOULD BE THE SAME THING THAT WE ALSO DISPLAY UP HERE
BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT HAVING LIKE SOME BUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY EVEN BE SHORTER THAN FIVE LINES
LIKE REALLY JUST GETTING I THINK GETTING ONE OR TWO BEST UTTERANCES FOR EACH SEGMENT WOULD BE REALLY WORTHWHILE
FOR THE SEARCH RESULTS I PROBABLY THINK THAT INSTEAD OF A P A SIMPLE SUMMARY
SOMETHING THAT DISPLAYS THE UTTERANCE WHERE THE WHERE THE WORD WAS LIKE DISPLAYS IN A HIGHLIGHTED FORM WHERE IT WAS FOUND
TO TO APPLY WHAT
WELL ALTERNATIVELY WE COULD ALWAYS HAVE SORT OF A THIRD SMALL COMPONENT WHATEVER
LIKE IF THIS WAS THE SEARCH RESULTS
AND THEN THEY ARE JUST LIKE SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S PART UNWRITTEN WHEN MILES GOES OVER THIS ONE IT TRIGGERS THAT ONE TO DISPLAY IT OR SOMETHING
AND A TOOL TIP IS I THINK A VERY STRAIGHTF YEAH
IT ESPECIALLY WITH A PREVIEW WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET TOOL TIP FAIRLY SIMPLE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A PROPERTY OF IT
UH I'VE NEVER SEEN TOOL TIPS DISPLAYING SEVERAL LINES AND STUFF THOUGH SO I WONDER HOW GOOD THAT'LL LOOK
BUT WE'LL WE CAN TRY THAT
REALLY
WELL SO FAR ONLY SEEN TOOL TIPS OF FEW WORDS LENGTH
BUT YEAH UH THAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY EASY
YEAH YEAH WE WILL HAVE
THAT'S ACTUALLY JUST GONNA HAPPEN TODAY AND WE WILL HAVE PROPER SEGMENTS AS WELL
UM THE THING I REMEMBER LIKE I HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW TO DO IT WITHOUT REDRAWING THE DISPLAY EACH TIME
BECAUSE THE DISPLAY AT THE MOMENT DOES TAKE
YOU SEE LIKE IT TAKES A FRACTION OF A SEGMENT TO DISPLAY BUT PROBABLY TOO MUCH TO UPDATE IT TO COMPLETELY REPAINT THE WHOLE THING EVERY SECOND
SO UM AT THE MOMENT I'M JUST WHENEVER IT NEEDS TO BE REPAINTED
I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT TO DO AND JUST REPAINTING THE THING AS A WHOLE WITH A MOVING BAR THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA
BUT UNTIL I THINK OF SOMETHING BETTER
WHAT I'LL JUST DO IS I'LL JUST I'LL PROBABLY NOT HAVE A MOVING BAR THE WHOLE LENGTH BUT JUST SOME INDICATOR SOMEWHERE
LIKE WHATEVER JUST UH A TRIANGLE MOVING AT THE BOTTOM FOR NOW OR SOMETHING
AND THEN I CAN JUST LIKE REPAINT A SMALL AREA OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH I HAVE TO FIND I HAVE TO FIND OUT THE THE COMMANDS FOR LIKE REALLY JUST REDRAWING A SMALL SMALL PIECE
SO I HAVE TO JUST THERE'S EXAMPLES T UM FOR FOR DOING STUFF LIKE THAT
I JUST HAVE TO READ UP ON IT
BUT YEAH DISPLAYING THE THE CURRENT POSITION BAR WILL BE EASY PROVIDED THAT MY WHOLE CALCULATIONS OF LIKE WHERE WE ARE IN TIME HERE ARE ALL CORRECT
I MEAN THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT ISN'T TESTED SO FAR
BUT IT SHOULD BE
I MEAN
SO THE THE GENERAL CONCEPT
WILL WILL YOU TWO JUST UH KEEP ON WORKING ON IMPROVING THE INFORMATION DENSITY MEASURES OR DO YOU THINK THERE'LL BE A POINT WHEN YOU SAY WELL THAT'S THAT'S IT
WE HAVE WE HAVE AN INFORMATION DENSITY SCORE AND AND WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO DO
OR
OKAY
'KAY
WELL I'M ACTUALLY AT THE MOMENT I DON'T SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN WORK ON ON THE PROGRAMMING ANYWAY
HMM
NO
DID WE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I GUESS I MEAN
UH I WAS A BIT PISSED OFF YESTERDAY ABOUT THAT PART BECAUSE IT WAS SORT OF JUST LIKE A DECISION WE HAD TAKEN
SO OKAY WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EVALUATION L IN THE FIRST REPORT AND THERE'S NOTHING NEW WE CAN SAY ABOUT IT THIS TIME
AND I THOUGHT WE SAID THAT IN THE MEETING BEFORE WE WROTE THE REPORT
AND THEN HE CAME BACK WITH THIS WHOLE CRITICISM SAYING LIKE OH
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT UM EVALUATION AND THEN YEAH BUT WE DID THAT IN THE LAST REPORT
WE SAID WE'RE NOT GONNA GO OH BUT NOW I EXPECTED IT IN MORE DETAIL AND OH
IF THAT TRANSLATES TO EIGHTY PERCENT LIKE IF IF THOSE ACTUALLY TRANSLATE TO TO REALLY LIKE THEIR PERCENTAGE SCORES THEN THAT WOULD BE GOOD
HMM
SIXTEEN
WHAT
THERE WERE FORTY PERCENT EACH AND THIS IS HOW THEY BECAME SIXTY PERCENT NOW WHAT OKAY
UM HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THERE WERE
TEN EACH
NOT BAD
WE ALSO IT IT JUST MEANS THAT HE'S RELATIVELY LENIENT BECAUSE I MEAN THE REPORTS WERE I THINK THEY WERE OK GOOD REPORTS
BUT LIKE PROBABLY SOMEBODY ELSE WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THEY WERE EXCELLENT
SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN 'CAUSE IT SHOWS THAT HE'S NOT HELL BENT ON
UH AND THEN HE'LL SEE THE FINAL DISPLAY AND HE'LL REALISE THAT IT WAS ALL FAKE THAT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO ANY OF THE WORK
SEE THE THING IS
LIKE FOR ME PERSONALLY I THINK A LOT OF WORK WILL BE DONE IN IN THE LAST MINUTE IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE
THAT'S NOT A NEW STATEMENT AT GENERAL
BUT
LIKE THE WEEK JUST BEFORE THE PRESENTATION I HAVE MOST OF THE STUFF THAT I I'M DOING NOW I'M RID OF IT INCLUDING THE DISSERTATION AND DIL
SO
HMM
SO JASMINE IF IF YOU GOT SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND LIKE THIS FOR FOR YOUR CURRENT DATA WOULD THAT HELP IN
I SORT OF HAVE BEEN PROMISING THIS FOR A WEEK NOW I REALISE
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
UH 'CAUSE IT'S EMPTY AT THE MOMENT
I MEAN DAVE I IT'S A PRETTY MUCH R IT SH SHOULD BE A QUESTION OF COPYING IT OVER IT R OVER RIGHT
SO I JUST DIDN'T
YEAH
CAN PROBABLY ADD A OPEN FILE DIALOGUE BOX WITH MINIMUM EFFORT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A READY MADE COMPONENT THAT RETURNS A STRING FOR A FILE NAME
OR THAT W YEAH
SO WE CAN DO THAT TODAY
YEAH
YEAH BUT WHY DON'T WE
YEAH I KNOW SURE IT J LIKE IT IT WOULD NOT NECESSARY NEED TO BE A PART OF THE FINAL THING
BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST PROVIDE SOME MEANS
EVEN IF IT DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY IN THE BEGINNING AS A START UP OPTION JUST TO ASK FOR A FILE NAME
'CAUSE THEN WE CAN JUST PUBLISH A SCRIPT THAT YOU JUST RUN AND THEN THIS WHOLE THING STARTS
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME TODAY LIKE I FORGOT ABOUT THE WHE I'M NOT SURE IF WE HAD THAT PROBLEM BEFORE
FINDING THE JAVA MEDIA THE JAVA X. MEDIA STUFF ON ALL THE JARS FOR THAT
YEAH I WAS LIKE SUDDENLY PANICKING AT ELEVEN WHEN I REALISED GOD I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD TO GET IT GOING HERE
AND THEN I GOT THAT THING
YES SO UM IF WE DO A VERSION WHICH AUTOMATICALLY OPENS UP A FILE OPEN BOX
YOU'RE YEAH F SO YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCING THE RIGHT FORMAT WITH THIS NO UM WITH JUST PER UTTERANCE
OKAY
MM-HMM
SO WOULD IT BE EASY SLASH DISSU DIFFICULT SLASH IMPOSSIBLE LIKE AT THE MOMENT IF WE SKIP TO A S TREATING A WHOLE SERIES AS ONE THING
SO LIKE CREATING ONE FILE FOR THE WHOLE SERIES THAT GIVES THE UTTERA THE IDEAS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND
BUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS
IT
HMM
YEAH
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN UH PRODUCE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
LIKE I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR LIKE FOR ONE GROUP NOT FOR THE WHOLE CORPUS
NO NO N
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH NO BUT DAVE UM YEAH SO THA THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING THAT LIKE THE SECOND MEETING SHOULD CONTINUE TILL THE FIRST ONE'S STOPPED
A AND FOR ONE GROUP THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF LIKE THEIR MEETING'S YOU KNOW LIKE THAT ONE MEETING AND THEN
HMM
THE UTTERANCES
OKAY AND AND THAT'S THE
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN THE LOGIC WISE
SORT OF LIKE UNTIL HERE IT'S THE MEETING ABOUT THIS THING AND THEN IT'S THAT THING AND THEN IT'S IT'S THIS LIKE
WHEREAS
WHEREAS UH S MAYB MAYBE WE'RE TALKING K LIKE SO SO YOUR DATA MANAGER WOULD THAT THEN HANDLE THE WHOLE THING
WOULD THAT HANDLE IT THAT THIS WOULD ONLY LIKE THE DISPLAY WOULD ONLY DISPLAY ONE GROUP
YEAH SO IF I MEAN I DON'T MIND WHERE IT'S DONE
SO IF THE DATA MANAGER FILTERS IT OUT AND LIKE I JUST THINK THAT IN IN THE LOGIC OF THE PROGRAMME IT'S IT'S MUCH EASIER TO JUSTIFY WHY WE SAY WE TREAT A SERIES OF MEETINGS AS ONE SINGLE THING RATHER THAN W
BUT A
I B LIKE WOULD JUST I WOULD FIND LOGICAL REASONS FOR WHY YOU CAN SUGG SAY PEOP
UH BUT I SEE THIS TWO COMPLETELY G DEF LIKE I SEE EACH SER EACH GROUP IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT SHOULDN'T
OKAY
BUT WOULD IT STILL LIKE WOULD WE STILL IN THE LOGIC OF IT STILL HAVE CONTINUOUS I. D. S IF WE SAY WE TAKE JUST JUST ONE MEETING
LIKE WOULD WOULD THE DISPLAY FOR EXAMPLE STILL BE ABLE TO JUST SAY I WANT FROM WHATEVER FROM THE FIRST UNTIL THE LAST AND AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN SORT OF AND AND THE DATA MANAGER WOULD THEN DISPLAY THAT JUST FOR THAT MEETING
OKAY WELL IF THAT'S POSSIBLE YEAH
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S WHAT VERA SAID
NO
SO YOU YOU'D YOU'D ALSO SAY THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE PART OF THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE IF THERE'S NO F. ZERO
YEAH
WELL I I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THE FUSING OF THE DIFFERENT IF INF IMPORTANCE MEASURES ANYWAY
BU IF THAT'S DONE IN THE PROGRAMME OR IF THAT'S DONE OFF LINE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
DOES ANYONE HAVE A GOOD IDEA LIKE AT THE MOMENT TO PLAY AROUND WITH IT
WHAT'S A GOOD WAY OF DISPLAYING TWO TYPES OF INFORMATION IN THE IN THE COLOUR DISPLAY
I MEAN UH THERE'S PROBABLY LOGICAL WAYS LIKE IF ONE IS WHATEVER IF ONE IS THE DARKNESS AND THE OTHER IS THE REDNESS OR SOMETHING
HAS ANYONE EVER EXPERIMENTED WITH SORT OF DISPLAYING TWO DIMENSIONAL INFORMATION IN IN COLOUR
BECAUSE THEN WE COULD DO JASMINE'S AND AND VERA'S PROBABLY IN THE SAME SCALE
YEAH
F FOR NOW
NO FOR NOW
LIKE YEAH FOR US
HMM
S
YEAH
YEAH I THINK WE SH WE SHOULDN'T
T
WE SHOULD ASSUME A N ASSUME A NON LINGUISTIC USER
BUT I THINK PROBABLY FOR US LIKE IN DEVELOPING IT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING
YEAH SO UM I'LL TRY THE RED GREEN BLUE
WHA WHAT'S DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THIS HUE AND SATURATION THING LIKE WHAT THAT NO NOBODY'S DONE MUCH COLOUR WORK
OH ACTUALLY IT'S NOT A PROBLEM OF DOING IT
LIKE I THINK IT'S
OKAY
OKAY WELL I GUESS I'LL JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE PHOTOSHOP COLOUR CUBE OR WHATEVER IT IS GIMP COLOUR CUBE AND LOOK AT
YEAH
YEAH
'KAY SO WE'LL PRODUCE A VERSION OF THIS WHICH OPENS UP WITH A DIALOGUE BOX UM WHERE YOU CAN SELECT A FILE
IS THAT RIGHT DAVE
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO DO THAT
AND AND THEN YOU'LL GET THIS TYPE OF DISPLAY WITH THAT FILE
AND THAT'S UH AT THE MOMENT ARE W SO ARE WE ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT USING THAT ONE MEETING THAT EVERYONE IS USING NOW
ARE TALK ABOUT SWAT SWI SWAPPING NOW
SWITCHING
YEAH
SO EVERYONE SHOULD PRODUCE STUFF FOR THE WHOLE CORPUS NOW
OR
OKAY
OKAY
WE NEED THE EXPLICIT INFORMATION ABOUT EACH MEETING THEN
LIKE SORTA WHI FROM WHICH UTTERANCE WHICH UTTERANCE IT GOES AND STUFF
IS ANYONE IS ANYONE PROVIDING THAT AT THE MOMENT
I DIDN'T DOES ANY
OKAY
OKAY
WELL IF YOU
YEAH I'M NOT SURE ABOUT
THAT
AS IN I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND MUCH ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DO TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS
WELL AS L AS LONG AS YEAH
AS LONG AS EVERYTHING'S IN THE RIGHT ORDER IT SHOULDN'T LIKE WE SHOULD EVEN BE ABLE TO JUST I. D. IT WHEN WE'RE READING IT IN
HMM
'KAY
YEAH SO IF WE EMAIL OUT A SCRIPT ON HOW TO LIKE F LOAD IT
UM SO YOURS WOULD ALWAYS LIKE YOURS WOULD ALWAYS BE LOADED IN I GUESS
LIKE YOU Y THERE WOULD ONLY BE ONE VERSION OF YOUR DATA AND YOU CAN JUST OVERRIDE THAT VERSION IF YOU WANT
BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A FILE OPEN DIALOGUE BOX FOR THAT THEN
WELL WHAT WOULD THE OPTION BE
OKAY
BUT LIKE SO MAKE IT AN OPTION WHICH ONE IT DISPLAYS OR WHICH ONE IT USES FOR THE SUMMARISATION OR 'CAUSE IT 'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING SORT OF SO THAT BOTH JASMINE AND VERA COULD UM SEE THEIR DATA WORKING AND
MM IS THAT NOT GETTING TOO MUCH
SO WE WOULD HAVE LIKE EACH OF THOSE COMPONENTS FOR
FOR JASMINE AND VERA
YEAH I KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT WOULD THAT NOT REQUIRE THREE CLOCKS AND I BUT THAT BUT BUT THAT ALSO MEANS
OKAY
'CAUSE THE DIALOGUE UH THE DISPLAY ALSO GETS THE INFORMATION ABOUT LIKE THE RELATIVE AND THE ABSOLUTE TIMES
SO THAT WOULD BE CONVENIENT IF THAT JUST IF THERE'S JUST ONE OF THAT 'CAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S GETTING MESSY
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST MAKE A SWAP INS WHY DON'T WE MAKE A SWITCH INSTEAD LIKE
I DON'T WANNA DO LIKE THREE LIKE THREE INTERNAL TIME SCALES SO THAT'S JUST GETTING MESSY
WELL I GUESS REALLY I MEAN LIKE ALTERNATIVELY WHY DON'T WE GO FOR THE SIMPLEST THING AND JUST CREATE THREE SCRIPTS OR TWO SCRIPTS WHICH LOAD A PARAMETER UH F COMMON LINE PARAMETER
WHICH IS WHICH FILE TO LOAD AND AND THEN IT'S JUST THERE
OKAY
YEP
OKAY
WOULD THE OTHERS
OH YOU OH YOU JUST HAVE THREE SUMMARISERS AND THEN THEY'RE ALL SYNCHED UP WITH ONE CLOCK
OKAY THE OTHER ONE IS JUST A STATIC DIALOGUE ACTS BOX
OKAY
OKAY
YEP
SO WE HAVE THREE COLOUR DISPLAYS
LIKE THREE OR
NO NO SURE
OR MAYBE JUST START WITH JUST TWO LIKE WITHOUT EVEN COMBINING THEM IN ANY SOPHISTICATED WAY
JUST JUST TWO
YEP
'KAY SHALL WE WRAP THAT UP
SOR SORRY I'M IMPOSING
YOU MEAN DISCONTINUOUS
IF I HAVE TO DO IT F LIKE FLEXIBLY THEN I PROBABLY THEN IT WILL NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT
BUT IS IT WORTH ANY EFFORT THOUGH I MEAN
'CAUSE WE'LL NEVER HAVE MORE THAN TWO AND WE'LL NEVER HA WELL WE'LL EITHER HAVE ONE OR TWO
SO IN THE END 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF WELL I GUESS YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
BUT THEN ALSO WE'D HAVE TO FIND MORE SOPHISTICATED WAYS OF LOADING IT SPECIFYING THE PARAMETERS
SO THAT MIGHT
YEAH BUT THAT WE WOULDN'T SO WE'D HAVE TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE BOX FOR OPENING STUFF
IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT TAKE HALF AN HOUR IN THE DISPLAY AND NOT MORE THAN THAT
HMM
BUT IT MIGHT ACTU I THINK IT MIGHT NOT REALLY BE WORTH IT TO BE HONEST
LET'S WORK ON THE OTHER STUFF FIRST LIKE THE OTHER STUFF
AND JUST PROVIDE LIKE SOMETHING WHERE EACH OF THEM JUST IF IF THERE'S UH A JASMINE SCRIPT AND A VERA SCRIPT AND THEY EACH CAN LOAD THEIR STUFF AND SEE THEIR DATA IN IN THE THING
THEY CA THEY EACH CAN SEE IT SUMMARISED BY THEIR DATA AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE STATIC ONE
THAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY EASY TO DO RIGHT
IF I JUST DOUBLE THE DISPLAY AND YOU MAKE A UH LIKE A NON SYNCHED UP SECOND DIALOGUE ACTS
AND YEAH AND THEN THEY CAN TUNE FINE TUNE THEIR MEASURES
I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL IF WE COULD CHECK THE NITE CLOCK F CODE OR WHATEVER CODE IT IS FOR THIS COMPONENT AND SEE IF WE CAN ACCESS THOSE RATE THINGS AND AND DO SOMETHING USEFUL WITH THEM AND GET NOTIFIED WHEN THEY CHANGE AND STUFF
YEAH I THINK
YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO
SO THE THE THING IS IT'S PROBABLY AN EASY TASK TO READ THAT RATE BUT IT'S PROBABLY MORE DIFFICULT TO GET AN EVENT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN IT'S CHANGED
SO THAT'S WHY WE MIGHT HAVE TO EXTEND NITE CLOCK AND LIKE OVERRIDE THE FUNCTION THAT REACT TO THAT
OR LIKE THE RATE IS PROBABLY A PROPERTY WHICH IN THE WORST CASE WE'D HAVE TO SET PUBLIC
BUT IF WE WANNA REACT TO IT BEING CHANGED AUTOMATICALLY WE MIGHT HAVE TO
OKAY
SO THEY HAVEN'T SP OKAY
YEAH SO IT SHOULDN'T LIKE EVEN IF TO EVEN IF UH IF WE HAVE TO EXTEND NITE CLOCK
I MEAN IT SHOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF CHANGING ONE SINGLE METHOD IN IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
YEP
YEAH
YEP
AND WE COULD JUSTIFY ALL SORTS OF STUFF LIKE THAT BY R IN THE PRESENTATION BY SAYING WE DELIBERATELY TRIED TO KEEP ANY COMPLEXITY AND NUMBERS AND STUFF AWAY FROM PEOPLE
I THINK THAT'S SORT OF A LINE WE SHOULD GO BY IN GENERAL SORT OF SAYING YEAH WE COULD'VE DONE OH SO MANY TH
WE DON'T WANNA CONFUSE PEOPLE
WE GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING SIMPLE AND COLOURFUL WHERE SOMETHING IS MOVING AND WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO L DEAL WITH ANY NUMBERS OR TEXT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR THAT MATTER
IN FACT THAT'S WHY WE'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF A DOG SITTING IN A FIELD INSTEAD OF A MEETING BROWSER
IT IS NICE AND IT CALMS PEOPLE DOWN
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
SHALL WE MEET IN AN HOUR OR SO DAVE
I'M PROBABLY GONNA EAT SOMETHING QUICK
AH OKAY I WAS ACTUALLY I WAS PLANNING THE SAME BUT WE WON'T GET SO MUCH DONE BEFORE THREE THAT'S THE THING
'KAY LISTEN SO WHY DON'T WE MEET AFTER THREE THEN BECAUSE THEN I CAN LIKE UNTIL THREE MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE ALL THE DISPLAY C
YEAH SURE YEAH
S OH SO WE COULD MEET AT FIVE AND I HAVE THE DISPLAY CODE READY BY THEN
WHICH DOES THE STUFF LIKE LIKE HAVING A BAR WHERE THE POSITION IS AND STUFF
AND
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
SO WE CAN MEET IN FIVE IN APPLE AT FIVE IN APPLETON TOWER AND JUST WORK ON SO I'LL I'LL HAVE MY DISPL I'LL MAKE SURE THAT MY DISPLAY DOES ALL THE STUFF WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT UN UNTIL THEN
AND THEN WE'LL PUT THOSE THINGS TOGETHER
YEAH
BUT I MEAN LIKE WE WE SHOULD DISCUSS TOGETHER WHICH W LIKE HOW THE THE SEARCH INTERACTS WITH THE REST
SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT COLIN SHOULD JUST DO IN HIS OWN
HOW Y HOW DO YOU DO THE SUMMARY
IS IT
SO ARE YOU BASING IT ON CERTAIN THRESHOLDS UH OVER A SPECIAL D UH S OKAY
OH THAT'S THE OLD OLD ONE
OKAY
OKAY
UM
SO YOU WANT TO SEND STEVE THE PROTOTYPE AND WE SHOULD CHANGE DATA
WHERE'S THE BEST BEST PLACE TO PUT IT
OH
DO YOU UM TAKE IT FROM FROM MY DIRECTORY
OR DO I HAVE TO PUT IN IN THE SH
YEAH BUT WOULD YOU TAKE IT FROM FROM MY DIRECTORY
OR OKAY
MAYBE THAT'S THE PROBLEM
MAYBE THEY HAVE GOT UM THE MINUS IN THE CODE AS WELL AND THEN SOMETHING IN IS MESSED UP
UH-HUH
AND THE AREA COULD BE SMALLER
YEAH AS SOON AS I'VE FINISHED ALL THE MEETINGS I THINK THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TO DO UNLESS I GET SOME EVALUATION METHOD
BUT THAT COULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT
I WOULD HAVE TO TAG UH SOME PART OF IT OR SOMETHING
BECAUSE IF I D IF I CAN'T EVALUATE I CAN'T DO ANY BETTER
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO BETTER IF I DON'T EVALUATE ANYTHING
YEAH
YEAH HE'S REALLY KEEN ON THAT ISN'T HE
MM
I DON'T KNOW
TEN PERCENT EACH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO BUT IT'S
UM
YEAH
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT N YEAH IT MIGHT BE OF HELP
YEAH
IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL THOUGH I THINK
HMM
UH YEAH F PER UTTERAN UH I PRINT THE UTTERANCES IN THE I. D.
UH NO THE THE I. D. OF THE UTTERANCE AND UH THE MEASURE I THINK
THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE
IF I JUST TAKE WELL M A FILE OR WHERE ONE MEETING IS IN OR
CONCATENATE ALL THOSE SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD
HAVE YOU CURRENTLY GOT CONTINUOUS I. D. S FOR YOUR TOPIC SEGMENTS
OH OKAY I THOUGHT YOU HAD DONE ALL OF THEM AND
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
IS THAT WHAT V WHAT YOU'VE GOT BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT MEETING SERIES OVERLAP
I THINK
I DON'T KNOW
MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO THE USER THOUGH JUST THE WORD IMPORTANCE MAYBE
BUT WE HAVE GOT THE INDEX UM FOR CONVERTING FROM VERA'S I. D. S TO TO YOURS
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM SHOULD IT
YEAH I'VE DONE THAT FOR THE CORRELATION AS WELL
SO THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS QUITE EASY TO DO
HAVE YOU GOT THAT FOR NO IT'S JUST FOR ONE MEETING AT THE MOMENT
OH OKAY SURE
SO WHAT KIND OF CHANGE WILL YOU IMPOSE ON THE SUMMARISATION
BECAUSE IF WE FINE TUNE UH UM ACCORDING TO THAT AND IT'S NOT FINISHED IT'S N DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
OKAY
RIGHT
UH-HUH
OKAY
SO YOU AT THE MOMENT YOU HAVE GOT A THRESHOLD AND EVERYTHING THAT'S ABOVE IT IS DISPLAYED
OR HOW DO YOU D
YEAH SO IT'S SOME KIND OF THRESHOLD THAT IS SET OKAY
OKAY
DID I TELL YOU THAT WE'VE GOT KIND OF TWO WAY INTERACTION
IF YOU CONTROL CLICK AN UTTERANCE IT WILL PLAY WHERE IT SHOULD BE IN THE FILE
WE SHOULD PROBABLY SET THOSE SIZES 'CAUSE THAT'S SUCH AN EASY THING TO DO
ARE YOU MISSING THE SOUND
OH THERE IT IS
YEAH
THAT'S VERA'S DATA ON THE DISPLAY
BUT THE SEGMENTS ARE JUST MADE UP AREN'T THEY
YOU CAN ALSO CONTROL CLICK ON THE DIALOGUE ACTS AND IT WILL PLAY THAT SECTION OF THE FILE AS WELL
YEAH IF YOU WANT
OH THAT ONE LOOKS ALMOST COM JUST YOU NEED TO
THE ORIGINAL THE VERY FIRST ONE
YEAH
UM IT WILL BE IN PROGRAM
WHERE DO I CALL YOUR DISPLAY
NO IT IS ON YOUR DISPLAY
UM WHERE IT CALLS WHICH ONE TO GET YOU JUST NEED TO CHANGE THE FLAG
UM I THINK IT MUST BE UNLESS I IT
OH NO ACTUALLY YEAH YOU CAN CHANGE IT FOR IN THE SUMMARY WHEN THE SUMMARY GETS CALLED IN PROGRAM MANAGER YOU CAN DO IT
NO NOT YET
IT'S JUST PICKS THE TOP RANKED ONES AT THE MOMENT
YEAH THE EASIEST THING IS IN PROGRAMME MANAGER WHERE IT MAKES THE SUMMARY
IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST PLACE TO DO IT
IT'LL BE ABOVE THAT
IT'LL BE DOWN
IT'S GONNA BE AFTER THE DATA MANAGER'S MADE
YEAH THAT
A NEW SUMMARY
YEAH TH CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE I PUT IT
MAYBE IT WILL BE IN S THE SUMMARY CONSTRUCTOR THEN
YEAH TRY THE SUMMARIES CONSTRUCTOR
WELL IT READS THEM INTO SEPARATE ARRAYS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST CHANGE A FLAG TO SELECT ONE I WHICH ONE IT GIVES BACK
YEAH IF YOU WANT
UH THAT SHOULD BE FINE
YEAH I SHOULD MAKE A NEW CONSTRUCTOR THAT LETS YOU SET THE FLAG
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S WEIRD
ON MINE IT COMPLAINS ABOUT
OKAY
I THINK THAT TO BE HONEST IS SOMETHING WE CAN WORRY ABOUT AT THE END
I MEAN THAT'S QUITE TRIVIAL TO CHANGE AND WE GOT A LOT OF OTHER WORK TO DO
YEAH WE NEED TO GET ON THAT PRETTY SHORTLY I THINK
OKAY SO I'LL NEED TO DO SOME CHANGES TO PROGRAM MANAGER TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE UM CHANGING RESULTS
WHAT KIND OF INDEX
TAKE AND MAKE THEM IN A HASH MAP OR SOMETHING
CERTAINLY FOR NOW YEAH
YEAH
UM WELL FROM THE POINT OF US DEVELOPING IT IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE
UM WELL AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST A AN OLD FILE
IT'D PROBABLY BE YEAH BEST TO MAKE A COPY OF IT
I'D HAVE THOUGHT
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO UM THE SPEECH TOOLS THROUGH JAVA NATIVE INTERFACE 'CAUSE THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THEM IS HORRIFIC
IT'S REALLY BAD
SO I THINK I'M THINKING I'LL JUST WRITE OUT A SCRIPT AND DO IT WITH A SYSTEM CALL
NOT YET
YEAH THE I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH WASTING TOO MUCH TIME ON IT
YEAH
HMM
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE THAT LONG ANYWAY
YEAH YEAH
SO YEAH IT WE JUST START EVERYTHING AFTER THE SUMMARY'S BEEN CREATED
IT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM
YEAH
UM I DON'T THINK I'LL NEED THAT REALLY 'CAUSE I'LL JUST DUMP OUT A TEMPORARY FILE
I THINK WE SHOULD DECIDE WHAT WE WANT IT TO ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE IN THE END
'CAUSE ARE WE GONNA HAVE SOME KIND OF TREE VIEW TO REPRESENT THE MEETINGS AND STUFF
BECAUSE IF IF WE'RE NOT THEN WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE THE GRAPHICAL DISPLAY DISPLAY A BIT MORE INFORMATION
MM
IT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO DO AND IT'S SORT OF A HACK KIND OF WAY 'CAUSE WE CAN JUST TREAT IT ALL AS ONE MEETING
BUT WE'LL JUST CREATE LIKE HARD SEGMENTS AT THE START AND END OF EACH MEETING
LIKE ONES THAT ARE RED INSTEAD OF BLACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
SO OTHER THAN YEAH OTHER THAN WELL WE'LL JUST CREATE A HARD BOUNDARY IN BETWEEN EACH ONE SO YOU CAN SEE THE THING
YEAH
I MEAN THAT'S QUITE A CHEAP WAY TO DO IT
IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO DO IT IN THE SUMMARISER
YEAH IT WILL STILL APPEAR CONTINUOUS ON THE DISPLAY
SO HOW ARE WE GONNA DISPLAY THE SEARCH FOR THIS CORPUS
OKAY
OKAY
HOW ADVANCED ARE WE GONNA HAVE OUR SEARCH
BECAUSE I DEFINITELY THINK WE SHOULD RESTRICT IT TO I THINK WE SHOULD UM BE ABLE TO RESTRICT IT TO SPECIFIC SPEAKERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
BUT NOTHING TOO FANCY
OH I UH WELL WITH A SPEAKER I. D.
YEAH IN FACT IF SOMEONE COULD CREATE A FILE WITH THE SPEAKER I. D. S AND SPEAKER NAMES
THAT DONE
OKAY
WHERE IS IT
IS IT IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY
OKAY
YEAH IT'S UM THE DATA MANAGER SHOULD BE QUITE WELL DOCUMENTED
SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THAT FOR THE SEARCH QUITE EASILY
UH FROM YEAH ON THE DIALOGUE ACT LEVEL
I'VE NOT GOT IT READING IN THE TOPIC SEGMENTS YET
JUST 'CAUSE THAT WAS LOWER PRIORITY
BUT YEAH ALL THE YOU CAN GET ALL THE UTTERANCES
SO WHERE ARE GONNA PUT THE SEARCH RESULTS
IF WE MOVE EVERYTHING TO THE RIGHT A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE A LITTLE BAR ON THE LEFT
YEAH LIKE THE SEARCH RESULTS IN THERE
YEAH YEAH
LIKE WE'LL BASI YEAH
WE'LL GET SOMETHING TO PRINT OUT THEIR LOCATIONS
SO WE'LL ARRANGE IT IN A NICE LITTLE ORDER
WE
YEAH
IT'S QUITE EASY TO DO THOUGH
SO I THINK WE PROBABLY SHOULD
UH WE SHOULD TRY RUNNING THAT THING AGAIN SEE WHAT IT DOES NOW
OR JUST DELETE OR BACK UP IT
OH J SO I CAN PRINT OBSCENE MESSAGES IN THE BACKGROUND TO UM STANDARD OUTPUT
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK VERY WELL
IT'S CAPABLE OF SLOWING DOWN THE AUDIO BUT SPEEDING UP DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK AT ALL
YOU HAVE TO PAUSE IT AND PLAY IT FOR THE
YEAH THAT'S UH THEIR CLOCK COMPONENT
OH IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME COMPONENT THAT DOES THAT
UH NO WE'D HAVE TO LOOK IN THEIR CODE AND SEE WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES
THIS THING IS REALLY BIZARRE
IT SLOWS IT DOWN A BIT
THE SPEED UP DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK
YEAH
ALSO THEIR GRASP OF ALGEBRA IS TERRIBLE
WELL YEAH IT SHOULDN'T BE MINUS TWO TIMES IT SHOULD BE HALF
'CAUSE THAT'D BE PLAYING IT BACKWARDS TWICE AS QUICKLY
UH IT SHOULD DO BUT YOU'VE PROBABLY GONE PAST THE END OF THE FILE
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK IT'S JUST UM IT DID DO IT
IT'S THAT BRIGHT SELECTION
BE YEAH UH
EITHER THAT OR ANOTHER
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE QUITE COOL IS IF YOU COULD UM YOU KNOW LIKE SOME APPLICATIONS WHEN YOU OPEN A FILE YOU GET LIKE A LITTLE PREVIEW
IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT DISPLAYS LIKE A FIVE LINE SUMMARY WHEN YOU YOU'RE ABOUT TO OPEN THE FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HMM
YEAH
THE SUMMARISER IS QUITE QUICK
IT COULD PROBABLY DO IT DYNAMICALLY
YEAH IT'D LOOK PRETTY AND I'M NOT CONVINCED YOU'D GET ANY KIND OF GOOD QUALITY SUMMARY OUT OF IT IN ONLY FIVE LINES
BUT
ANOTHER QUITE GOOD THING MIGHT BE UM HOW ARE YOU DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT IS TO APPLY TWO TIPS TO THINGS IN JAVA
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE
'CAUSE WHAT WOULD BE QUITE COOL IS IF ON THIS SEARCH RESULT YOU COULD GIVE IT EACH ONE A TOOL TIP THAT HAD THE CONTEXT
LIKE THE UTTERANCE BEFORE THE UTTERANCE ITSELF AND THE UTTERANCE AFTER
SO THAT WHEN YOU HOVERED OVER IT
BUT YEAH IF WE CAN GET THE TOOL TIP WE SHOULD USE IT THOUGH
'CAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE QUITE EASY
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
UM IT'S QUITE COMMON IN LIKE SOME APPLICATIONS
YEAH
UM ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS JUST ONE VALUE
UM THE HEIGHT IT DOESN'T CHANGE IN VALUE DOES IT
SO IF YOU JUST REMEMBER THE COLOUR THAT IT WAS LAST AT AND YOU RE DRAW A LINE BEHIND IT OF THAT COLOUR AND THEN THE NEXT ONE
NO RIGHT NOW IT PROBABLY WON'T BE THAT MUCH BENEFIT
RIGHT NOW IT PROBABLY WON'T BE MUCH BENEFIT
SO THIS IS THE COMPONENT BASED EVALUATION HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY ISN'T IT
YEAH
OH SO THAT'S A BIT ANNOYING 'CAUSE LIKE IT'S MY HOPE WE COULD JUST GO COBBLE SOMETHING TOGETHER AND JUST SAY LOOK IT'S GREAT
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THEY DO 'CAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST UM SIXTY PERCENT OR ISN'T IT
'CAUSE IT'S I THOUGHT THEY WERE THIRTY PERCENT EACH
ONLY TEN PERCENT
I THOUGHT THEY'RE THIRTY
YEAH
'CAUSE I THINK WE'D RAMPANTLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW LONG IT'D TAKE TO DO THE ACTUAL UH SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BIT
SEE I'LL PROBABLY JUST BE STARTING STUFF THEN 'CAUSE I'LL BE STARTING THE UH S. N. L. P. THING AND THE D. M. PROJECT
WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR YOUR D. M. PROJECT
OH
IS YEAH I KIND OF NICKED THE IDEA
HE WENT ABOUT CODE M. L.
I'M GONNA MAKE ONE FOR GUITAR TABLATURE
YEAH
BUT I I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BIT OFF MORE THAN I COULD CHEW
SO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE QUITE HARD
MM WELL TAB DOESN'T USUALLY HAVE MUSIC NOTATIONS JUST UM PITCH INFORMATION
UH
SEE HOW FAR I GET ANYWAY
MM YEAH
WELL YOU CAN EASY ADD A COMMAND LINE PARAMETER
MM
IT MAY EVEN RETURN A FILE DIRECTLY
POSSIBLE
PROBABLY
UM THE THING IS IT I DON'T KNOW
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO CALL IT FILE OPEN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S IT'S MORE LIKE AN OPTION
TO SET THE PAR
BECAUSE IT READS EVERYTHING JUST FROM ONE FILE
MM-HMM
OH YEAH THAT DID HAPPEN ONCE BEFORE
OR EVEN JUST THE ENTIRE CORPUS
THAT'S WHAT UM COLIN'S FILE HAS GOT
DOES HIS
IT'S IT'S EASY TO LOAD THAT MUCH JUST TEXT
UH I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO GO FOR THE WHOLE CORPUS BECAUSE THE MEET THE UM THE I. D. S GONNA HAVE GAPS AND STUFF IN THEM OTHERWISE
AND IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO READ THROUGH THE LIST OF UTTERANCES WHEN YOU'RE COMPILING ALL THE DATA OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
YEAH
YEAH
WELL A AT THE MOMENT THE MAIN DATA I THAT'S JUST UH UNIQUELY NUMBERED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS
WELL AT THE MOMENT FROM THE DUMP FILE IT'S JUST GOT THEM UNIQUELY NUMBERED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CORPUS
HMM
AND IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO DO THAT ANYWAY BECAUSE UM THAT MEANS YOU GOT MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH HOW YOU WANT TO GROUP THEM
AND ONE THING YOU REALLY DON'T WANT IS EVER TO HAVE TWO UTTERANCES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE THE SAME I. D.
YEAH BUT THAT'S THE POINT OF THE DATA MANAGER IS TO MANAGE ALL THAT
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY MUCH POINT
'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S GOT QUITE NICE PROPERTY THAT THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER ALSO COINCIDES WITH THE ARRAY INDEX NUMBER IN THE ARRAY OF DIALOGUE ACTS
WHICH IS QUITE NICE
WELL YOU COULD YOU COULD CHOOSE WHATEVER YOU WANTED
BUT YOU MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN THE SAME SERIES EACH TIME
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DISPLAY ALL MEETINGS THAT HAD A PARTICULAR PHRASE MENTION SAY
AND THOSE MIGHT NOT BE THE ONES THAT WE ENUMERATED AS ONE MEETING IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE CONFLICTING I. D. S AND THINGS LIKE THAT
WHEREAS THE DA IF YOU DO IT IN THE DATA MANAGER
YOU CAN CONTROL ANY LOGIC LIKE THAT PROGRAMMATICALLY RATHER THAN DOING IT BY HAND AND SETTING IT IN STONE FOR ALL TIME
WELL IT'S JUST GOOD PRACTICE
LIKE IT SEPARATES THE DATA FROM THE PROGRAMME LOGIC
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING IS EMBEDDING SOME OF THE PROGRAMME LOGIC IN THE DATA
YEAH BUT THAT'S A DECISION WE'RE FORCING ON THE USER WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO
YEAH I DON'T SEE WHY NOT
YEAH
I THINK IT SH EVERYTHING SHOULD BE LIKE THAT CONTINUOUS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
I'M NOT SURE I HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT THE DATA
IF THERE'S NO VALUE I GUESS YOU HAVE TO PUT A ZERO IN
YEAH
WELL IT MIGHT BE MORE SENSIBLE TO ASSIGN IT AN AVERAGE VALUE
WELL WE'D W ONLY USE F. ZERO WHEN IT WAS PRESENT THOUGH WOULDN'T WE
WE WELL WE'D WANT TO USE F. ZERO WHEN IT'S PRESENT
YEAH
YEAH IN THE SUMMARISER IT'D BE THE UH IDEAL PLACE TO DO THAT
YOU COULD USE UM RED GREEN AND BLUE TO DISPLAY UP TO THREE
WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT IN JAVA
BUT
THE TROUBLE IS THAT HUE ISN'T A VERY SENSIBLE SCALE
LIKE IT COMES UP TO LIKE RED TWO OR THREE TIMES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
OR YOU COULD JUST SPLIT IT INTO TWO BLOCKS I SUPPOSE FOR NOW
YEAH
WELL THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT CAN'T SWAP MEETINGS AT THE MOMENT IF THE DATA'S THERE FOR IT
YEAH THAT'S MOST SENSIBLE WAY TO DO IT I THINK
YEAH THAT'S WELL IT'S NOT READING THAT IN YET BUT THAT WILL BE PART OF THE DATA MANAGER AS WELL
LIKE THERE'S ACCESS CLASSES ALL DEFINED FOR THAT
YEAH IT'S IN YOUR FILE ISN'T IT
'CAUSE EACH UTTERANCE HAS GOT AN I. D. ASSOCIATED WITH IT
I DON'T KNOW
SO JUST KEEP YEAH JUST ENUMERATE UP FOR THE NEXT NUMBER
THREE
WELL THAT'S WHAT I MEANT IS IT'S A BIT POINTLESS HAVING IT AS FILE OPEN 'CAUSE IT WILL BE OPENING THOSE FILES ALL THE TIME
IT'S MORE SENSIBLE TO HAVE IT AS AN OPTION AND THE LOCATION OF THEM
OR JUST SO YOU CAN CONFIGURE THE THE LOCATION OF ALL THE FILES AS AN OPTION
BUT WHEN IT STARTS UP IT SHOULD JUST READ THEM FROM THE DEFAULT PLACE
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
OH OF COURSE T THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T MAKE A DEVELOPMENT VERSION THAT DISPLAYS BOTH HAS TWO WIN UTTERANCE WINDOWS AND UH TWO GRAPHICAL DISPLAYS
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU IT'D HAVE TO PICK WHICH ONE TO SYNCH THE CLOCK TO
TO ADD ANOTHER DIALOGUE ACT WINDOW IS REALLY EASY
OH LIKE SAY IF YOU COULD MAKE A UM CHANGE TO YOUR THING SO IT COULD DISPLAY UH LIKE IT IN TWO HALVES
SO LIKE THE TOP HALF ONE THE BOTTOM HALF THE OTHER
OR MAYBE THREE ACTUALLY
MAYBE TOP HALF ONE BOTTOM HALF THE OTHER AND THE THIRD ONE AN AVERAGE THAT WE CAN CHANGE THE PARAMETERS FOR
AND THEN YEAH I COULD EASILY MAKE IT THROW OUT THREE DIFFERENT DIALOGUE ACTS
NO I'D JUST HAVE TWO OF THEM NOT SYNCHED UP BECAUSE IT'S JUST FOR EVALUATING THE DATA
OH RIGHT YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
OH NO NO IT'S STILL GOOD BECAUSE UM
OH NO IT ISN'T
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
YEAH
YEAH I SUPPOSE
NO HOLD ON YOU IT WOULDN'T NEED THREE INTERNAL TIME SCALES
'CAUSE ONLY ONE'S SYNCHED TO THE CLOCK OR IT C AND THE OTHERS ARE ALL ABSOLUTE REAL TIME AREN'T THEY
THAT'S WHAT'S DISPLAYED ON THAT THE BAR IS REAL TIME ISN'T IT
SO THEY WOULD ALL BE IN THE SAME TIME SCALE
NO NO ONLY ONE OF THEM SYNCHS AND TWO OF THEM ARE JUST YEAH
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
THEY SYNCH UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF EVALUATING THE DATA
YEAH
I MEAN NOT IN THE FINAL VERSION JUST FOR NOW
YEAH
HOW EASY WOULD IT BE TO MAKE IT SO YOU CAN ADD ARBITRARY NUMBERS OF THEM DO YOU THINK
NO LIKE UH DIFFERENT MEASURES TO THE DISPLAY
WELL THAT'S THE THING IF IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN LIKE AN HOUR OR SOMETHING IT'S NOT WORTH IT
YEAH
MM
BUT THAT'S EASY 'CAUSE MINE CAN TAKE UH ANY NUMBER OF PARAMETERS
MINE I'LL NEED TO MAKE A MINOR ADDITION TO THE DATA MANAGER AND THE SUMMARISER
BUT IT'S MORE OR LESS READY TO GO WITH THAT
OKAY
YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH SHOULD BE EASY
WE COULD JUST MAKE THAT RATE BE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
JUST DISCONNECT IT FROM WHATEVER IT'S DOING AND THEN HAVE THAT SET THE LENGTH OF THE SUMMARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MM
WELL IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T REACT TO IT BEING CHANGED AUTOMATICALLY
IT ONLY REACTS WHEN YOU PRESS PLAY AT THE MOMENT
SO YOU HAVE TO STOP IT AND START IT TO MAKE ANY EFFECT
MM
YEAH I MEAN JUST DISCONNECT IT FROM WHATEVER IT SENDS THE MEDIA PLAYER AND CONNECT IT UP TO OUR SUMMARISERS
THAT MAKES DIFFERENT LENGTH SUMMARIES
'CAUSE LIKE WE COULD MAKE THAT NOT EVEN HAVE LIKE A A REAL SORT OF MEANING JUST PUT LIKE MAX AND MIN
AND THE USER CAN JUST LIKE SET IT IN BETWEEN WHEREVER THEY WANT THE UH WITHOUT ACTUALLY TELLING THEM WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
WE SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE AWAY THE LABELS THAT SAY MINUS FOUR TIMES AS WELL
'CAUSE THAT'S INCREDIBLY UNINTUITIVE
WELL
BUT IT WON'T MAKE ANY HUGE CHANGES LIKE IT'LL ALWAYS HAVE THE EF THE ABILITY TO READ THE ORIGINAL ONES
BUT IT MIGHT BE QUITE COOL TO HAVE A COMBINED MEASURE
LIKE JUST A WEIGHTED AVERAGE IS PROBABLY THE MOST SENSIBLE WAY TO ABOUT IT AND POSSIBLY THRESHOLDING IT
NO IT JUST TAKES THE TOP LIKE TWENTY OR FIFTY OR HOWEVER MANY
YEAH
UM WELL I WAS GONNA GO TO THE GYM AT ABOUT THREE
SO
OR TO BE HONEST LIKE IT'S MUCH QUICKER FOR ME TO GET STUFF DONE ON MY OWN
IT'D MAKE MORE SENSE FOR US TO DIVIDE UP SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS DIVIDING UP TASKS AND THEN DO THEM SEPARATELY
WELL IT'LL BE AFTER FOUR THEN
'CAUSE I'M GONNA GO AT THREE
THE GYM
OKAY
SO MEET SAY FIVE TILL SEVEN THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TIME
BECAUSE YEAH IT'S MUCH QUICKER IF WE'RE BOTH WORKING SEPARATELY I THINK
'CAUSE WHEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER LIKE I'VE JUST NOT GOT A LOT DONE
AND LIKE WHEN I GO HOME I'LL SPEND LIKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AND GET LOADS DONE IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE UP THERE AS WELL THEN
YEP
RIGHT
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
MM
MM I SUPPOSE IT SHOULD DEPEND ON THE LENGTH OF THE SEGMENT
MM I GUESS THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE YEAH
HMM
HMM
YEAH I WAS WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THE SEARCH
YEAH
YEAH I'M QUITE KEEN TO DO LIKE MOST OF THAT
LIKE MAKE AN INDEX SEARCH AND STUFF
YEAH I THINK WHAT BASICALLY WHAT I NEED AT IS UM JUST A LIST OF WORDS WITH AN INDEX TO START WITH FOR EACH MEETING
UM I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AS LONG AS THEY'RE UNIQUE AND IT CAN I CAN PASS 'EM BACK TO YOU AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO THE DISPLAY
UM YEAH PROBABLY
YEAH
OH YEAH DO YOU WANT YOU KNOW HOW YOU'VE JUST GOT DATA FOR ONE MEETING ARE YOU NEEDING MORE AT THE MOMENT
MM I GUESS NOT
YEAH I THINK WE'RE ALL USING THE FIRST ONE
HMM
UM I THINK IT SEGMENTS QUITE WELL THOUGH FIRST ONE
YES IT'S NOT REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT LIKE NICE AND C CLEAN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
MM
HMM
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH I SUPPOSE MY SEARCH WILL R IT RETURNED THE UTTERANCE
BUT IF YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR A WORD YOU NEED AN INDEX FOR THE WORD AND THE UTTERANCE AS WELL
UM IT P IT'D PROBABLY SELECT IT YEAH
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO DO THAT
YEAH
VERY VERY BASIC YEAH
YEAH YEAH
IF YEAH IF IF YOU CAN PASS ME LIKE THE DIALOGUE ACT WITH
YEAH WAS IT THE SPEAKER
AND THEN
IT
YEAH THAT THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH SHOULDN'T IT
'CAUSE YOU CAN
OH YEAH I D I DID THAT YEAH
YEAH I D I DID THAT AS WELL ACTUALLY
UM YES IN THE DATA
YEAH GROUP DATA SPEAKER DATA OR SOMETHING
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
IS IT SORRY COULD I D USE THAT
AT THE MOMENT IT'S READY TO LIKE GET DIALOGUE ACTS OUT WITH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH I SHOULD MAYBE JUST GET STARTED WITH 'EM
MAKING A SEARCH WITH THAT
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
NO
YEAH
YEAH OF COURSE WE'VE GOT HERE
THAT WOULD BE EVIL
YEAH
OH DEAR
OH
YEAH MAYBE IT HAS A DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTOR WHEN YOU CREATE IT
IS IT
OH YEAH
I SUPPOSE
YEAH
SO DO YOU THINK A TREE VIEW FOR LIKE AN OVERVIEW OF THE WHOLE SET OF MEETINGS WOULD BE GOOD
YEAH IT W IT WOULD LOOK GOOD
HMM
YEAH I SUPPOSE YOU COULD CALCULATE THEM OFF LINE AND JUST YEAH HAVE A LIKE LIKE A L LITTLE THUMBNAIL OR SOMETHING
YEAH
I MEAN IT WOULD BE A BIT POINTLESS BUT IT WOULD LOOK GOOD FOR THE PRESENTATION
YEAH
I SUPPOSE
YEAH
HMM
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BUT I'D IMAGINE IT MUST BE QUITE EASY
YEAH IT'D BE NICE FOR A PRESENTATION YEAH YEAH
HMM
HMM
IS THAT QUITE EASY TO DO TO GET UM A MOVING CURSOR
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I WAS JUST GONNA DO SOME SORT OF INFORMAL EVALUATION
YEAH I DID SAY THAT
YEAH
YEAH HE DID GIVE US EIGHT OUT OF TEN THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH
NO I THINK THEY WERE TEN PERCENT EACH
YEAH
I THINK THEY'RE WORTH TEN PERCENT
HMM
YEAH I SUPPOSE HE CAN SEE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE WORK IN
I
YEAH THAT YEAH THAT INTERFACE AND INTEGRATION YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH SAME FOR ME
OH YEAH
OH NO I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
UM I'M GONNA DO LIKE AN ON LINE MUSEUM ARCHIVE
YOU GET LIKE A DOCUMENT FOR EACH EXHIBIT
OH YEAH
OH THAT'D BE QUITE A GOOD ONE ACTUALLY
YEAH WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO LIKE MUSIC NOTATION AND STUFF
RIGHT
OKAY THAT'S N NOT SO
HMM
HMM
WELL I HAVE I'VE ONLY DONE THE FIRST MEETING
BUT YEAH TH THAT'S THE PLAN
UM FOR THE TOPIC SEGMENTS
YEAH SORRY FOR TOPIC SEGMENTS I HAVE
BUT FOR THE UTTERANCES I'VE JUST GOT ONE MEETING SO FAR
BUT THE IDEA WAS THAT IT WOULD BE CONTINUOUS
YEAH
REMEMBER HOW DID I DO IT
HMM
I TH THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE PROGRAM 'CAUSE WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA WANT TO CHANGE IT
MM
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
YEAH WE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT YEAH
HMM
YEAH IT SHOULD BE EASY TO DO YEAH
YEAH I'VE GOT THE INDEXES FOR ALL THE MEETINGS I THINK
YEAH
NO I DON'T THINK SO
YEAH I'LL BE WORKING ON THE SEARCH I THINK
IT'S READY TO GET STARTED
YEAH I MAY AS WELL COME AND YOU CAN SHOW ME HOW IT THE MANAGER WORKS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH UH SO LET'S PERHAPS UH IN THE MEANTIME TALK ABOUT THE UM UM NUMBERS WE ASSIGN TO THE DIALOGUE ACTS BECAUSE UM YEAH
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU LEFT OUT THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE WORDS
SO I JUST EXTRACTED THE ACTUAL DIALOGUE NUMBERS
AND THE PROBLEM IS UM IT'S PERHAPS MORE UM DANGEROUS TO GET MISTAKEN WITH ALL THOSE NUMBERS AND NOT KNOWING WHY THINGS HAPPEN IF WE JUST DEVOTE NUMBERS AND N MAKE NEW UH N N
YEAH SURE BUT I MEAN FOR ALL THOSE MEASURES THAT ARE BASED ON WORDS UM I CAN AUTOMATICALLY JUST THROW THOSE WHERE IT'S NOTHING
BUT UM THOSE DIALOGUES ACTS UM LIKE THIRTY THREE IN IN THE FIRST MEETING UM THEY HAVE A DURATION EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE A WORD
UM SO FOR MY EARL OTHER MEASURES I I GET THEM AND I DON'T I MEAN I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK FOR EVERY SINGLE WRITE A PROGRAMME THAT LOOKS FOR EVERYTHING A NUMBER AND DOES THE MAPPING FOR THAT
YES
WHY IS THAT
MM-HMM
YEAH I JUST WANTED TO UH UM WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S NECESSARY AT ALL TO DO THAT
YEAH AND IT'S A PROBLEM IF THERE'S NO
BUT ACTUALLY I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE AUDIO SHOULDN'T THERE
IF THERE'S UM EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT A WORD I THINK IN THE AUDIO THERE WILL BE SOMETHING AT THAT POINT BECAUSE IT HAS A DURATION
HMM
SO D YOU CUT IT OUT
YEAH I MEAN BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL FOR THOSE
IT'S JUST
YEAH
YEAH UH I MEAN IT'S JUST A QUESTION I WANTED TO RAISE
OH OKAY S
SO UM BY HOW DID YOU ASSIGN THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER
DID YOU TAKE THE ONE YOU FOUND IN THE IN THE UM X. M. L. FILE AND JUST KNOW PUT IT THERE
OR DID YOU
OKAY
OKAY YOU END UP WITH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO
WHO HAS THAT GOING
YEAH
MM
PRESENTATION IS EXACTLY IN TWO WEEKS
UM UH AND RE I THINK WE SHOULD START TO THINK ABOUT EVALUATION BY NOW
I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME PEOPLE
YEAH BUT IT'S JUST UH THREE DAYS BETWEEN THE PRESENTATION AND THE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD HA TAKE THE TIME BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL BE
BUT WE'LL ALSO HAVE TO WRITE THE THE THING IN THAT TIME
I DON'T KNOW
BUT IT'S FIFTY PERCENT OF THE MARK
NO
YEAH
YEAH IT WOULD BUY US SOMETHING
NO
MM-HMM
UH THAT REALLY YEAH THAT MAKES IT REALLY QUITE DIFFICULT FOR US IF WE WANT TO TEST OUR STUFF THE FIRST HAVE TO FIGHT FOR OUR COMPUTERS WITHOUT CARDS
YEAH SURE
I MEAN I YEAH YEAH I I JUST CARE FOR THE WRITTEN ONE
DOES THAT WORK WITHOUT THE SOUND CARDS
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
HMM
OKAY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT DATA THAT I WORKED ON LAST WEEK
OR DO WE HAVE ANYTHING MORE ON THIS
YEAH
M PERHAPS MY LIST OF AGREEMENTS
PERHAPS MY LIST OF AGREEMENTS SOMEWHERE
YEAH IF WE FIND THEM GOOD ENOUGH
WE WANTED TO PROVIDE UM THAT IN AN EXTRA LIST SAYING PROBABLY AGREEMENT
YEAH FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
IT'S A BIT SMALL BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS
HMM
STRANGE
YEAH PERHAPS P BECAUSE IT'S WIDE SCREEN OR SOMETHING
YEAH
BUT UM OKAY WHAT YOU SEE HERE UM IN THIS PART IS UH
NO MOUSE YEAH
THERE IT IS YEAH
HERE IS UM A LIST OF THE UH UM MOST IMPORTANT OR YEAH MOST PROBABLE WORDS THAT OCCUR IN AGREEMENT
UM SO THE NUMBER IN THE FIRST BRACKETS IS UM SO I RUN IT ON ALL THE B. E. D. B. M. R. AND B. R. O. MEETINGS TO LEARN IT
UM SO UH THE NUMBER IN THE FIRST BRACKETS IS HOW OFTEN IT OCCURRED IN THE UM UTTERANCES THAT WERE ANNOTATED AS AGREEMENTS BY THE UH DIALOGUE ACT AGREEMENT
UM AND THE NUMBER IN THE SECOND BRACKETS IS HOW MUCH IT OCCURRED IN THE REST
AND UM THE FIRST NUMBER IN EVERY LINE IS UM HOW MUCH MORE OFTEN THAT IS PER SAME UM SAME TEXT LENGTH
SO UM THE NUM UH THE WORDS THAT UH IT GIVES IT ARE LOOK QUITE GOOD I THINK
IT'S UM YEAH EXCITING PERFECT TRUE INTERESTING EXACTLY CORRECT SUPER AND SO ON
UM AND THEN I RAN IT ON THE FIRST MEETING GETTING UM THE SO WHAT'S IN THE IN THE BRACKETS IN THIS WINDOW HERE IS THE UTTERANCES
UM AND THE MOMENT IT CAN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCES BETWE I MEAN YOU GET THE SAME VALUE FOR EVERY UTTERANCE THAT IS EXACTLY OR EVERY UTTERANCE THAT IS SURE
AND UM FOR THE LONGER UTTERANCES I JUST UM LOOK HOW OFTEN UM ONE OF THESE WORDS IS IN THERE AND SIMPLY ADD IT UP
SO THAT SHOULD IN PRINCIPLE FAVOUR LONGER UTTERANCES
UM AND YEAH AND SO THESE NUMBERS HERE UM ONE OR ZERO THESE HERE UM THAT'S UM
UM THE DIALOGUE ACT LABELS WHETHER IT'S UM UM IF THEY'RE ANNOTATED AS AGREEMENT THEY'RE NOT ZERO HERE
SO HERE UM FOR THOSE WHO GET A V THAT GET A VERY HIGH SCORE
UM THEY'RE MOSTLY NO NOT ZERO AND SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE ZERO ARE O ARE STILL VERY GOOD
LIKE I I DEFINITELY AGREE UM IT'S A NICE KIND OF AGREEMENT THAT WE PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE
UM AND WHEN YOU GET FURTHER DOWN YEAH YOU SEE THOSE WITH VERY LOW PROB UM SCORE ALSO HAVE UM NO AGREEMENTS
HERE THEY ARE
A LOT OF ZEROS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
SO IT LOOKS QUITE GOOD I THINK
UM SO THAT'S WHAT I GOT FOR AGREEMENT
THEN FOR DISAGREEMENT I DID ALSO BUT UM IT'S A BIT MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE'S SO LITTLE DISAGREEMENT
YEAH SO THERE YOU S AGAIN SEE THE LIST
BUT IT'S MUCH SHORTER AND IT'S MU MUCH WORSE
SMILIES
UM THAT IS UM HERE AT THE LIST OF UTTERANCES IT UM GETS US FOR THE FIRST MEETING
YEAH I MEAN I THINK PERHAPS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BUT UH RATED SO HIGH HERE
OR THINK
I THINK
UH YEAH
THINK IS ALSO RATED HIGHER IN THE NON AGREEMENT THAN IN THE AGREEMENT
I MEAN THERE IS SOME FUNNY THINGS
UM YES
YEAH THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT I'M GETTING HERE
YEAH IT'S JUST I MEAN IT'S IT'S EXACTLY THIS THING BUT JUST I WOULD I WOULD JUST HAVE TO RE SCALE THIS FACTOR HERE
AND I MEAN THIS IS THE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER
SO
YEAH I CAN JUST GIVE IT TO YOU IN THE FORMAT YOU WANT
SO IT W IT WILL JUST K
AND THEN SCORE YEAH IT THIS WAS JUST FOR SHOWING IT
HUH
YEAH
OKAY
UM ONE PROBLEM I USED TO HAVE IS WITH ALL THE YEAHS
BECAUSE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THEY ALL WRITE IT THE SAME
SO UM I WAS THINKING PERHAPS AT LOOKING UM AT THE UM ACOUSTIC MEASURES I HAVE
SO FOR EXAMPLE AT MY F. ZERO UM DEVIATION
BUT UM YEAH
BY NOW I JUST HAD A LOOK AT THE YEAH DATA UM AND ACTUALLY THE AVERAGE F. ZERO DEVIATION IS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER FOR THE POSITIVE ONES THAN FOR THE NEGATIVE ONES
I MEAN THERE IS A P DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO REALLY MAKE USE OF IT
BUT I PERHAPS INVESTIGATE SOME TIME STILL TO
YEAH
SO AND I TH MY MY HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT IF IT'S REALLY YEAH UH LIKE AGREEMENT
IT WILL SOUND DIFFERENT THAN IF IT THAN INTO IF IT IS JUST A BACK CHANNEL
MM
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE THRESHOLD
BECAUSE YOU HAVE UH YOU HAVE UM YOU DON'T HAVE IT ONLY WITH YEAHS
YOU HAVE IT ALSO WITH WORDS THAT ARE MUCH HIGHER RANKED
YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WITH YEP IS MUCH HIGHER RANKED BECAUSE IT OCCURS LESS OFTEN UM IN THE TRAINING THING
NO
UM IT'S ONLY IF THEY'RE USED IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
YES I B YEAH I KNOW THAT NOT EVERY YEP IS AN AGREEMENT
BECAUSE Y UM THIS RIGHT YEP AND OKAY THINGS ARE TYPICALLY ALSO BACK CHANNELS
YEAH BUT WE WOULD THROW A LOT AWAY THAT ARE QUITE GOOD
IF YOU IF YOU WOULD SET IT OFF
YES
MM-HMM
YEAH
I THINK FOR THIS MEETING UM THERE WERE UM WHAT WAS IT LIKE AR AROUND SI OR NINETY ANNOTATED AGREEMENTS OR YEAH AG AGREEMENT DIALOGUE ACTS
SO
I MEAN THE B THE BEST ONES ARE DEFINITELY THOSE ON THE FIRST SCREEN HERE
SO IT COULD JUST
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
PROBABLY HAVE TO PLOT THEM 'CAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE ALSO I MEAN THIS IS JUST ADDED BY DIFFERENT SPEAKERS FOR EXAMPLE
THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER
BUT IT'S JUST TWO SPEAKERS AGREEING I THINK
SAME FOR THIS ONE HERE FOR THESE TWO HERE
I MEAN THEY THEY WILL BE OPTICALLY MERGED ANYWAY
YEAH OKAY
THAT WAS JUST WHAT I
I ONL ONLY KEEP UH THE STUFF I ACTUALLY NEED ON IT AND THEN I CLEAN IT UP EVERY YOU KNOW EVERY
BUT ACTUALLY THIS ALL HERE IS N. L. S. S. D. BECAUSE IT WAS DATA A. THAT DIDN'T FIT ON MY UM QUOTA ANYMORE
OKAY
YEAH SAME THING UH UM WITH THE YOOHOOS AND SO ON
THAT DO NOT INCLUDE MM
OKAY THEN YOU YOU WILL PROVIDE A FILE WITH ALL THE MAPPINGS FROM THE OLD ONES TO THE
UNIQUE ONES
MM-HMM YES
YEAH BUT NOT TOO DETAILED
SO
UM BY THE WAY HOW LONG UM HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE FOR THE PRESENTATION
YEAH BUT MORE LIKE TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE LIKE AN HOUR
YEAH I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU PRESENT THE COMPONENTS OF WHAT IT IT'S BASED ON
THEN YOU WILL NEED MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES TO PRESENT IT I GUESS
IT'S QUESTION
YEAH THEN
MY COMPUTER
UH IT DOESN'T HAVE LINU LINUX
SO
MM
YEAH
YES
AND YOU WOULD OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE TOO COMPLICATED TO COPE WITH THE THI UH SYSTEM IF YOU HAVE TO RE ADJUST IT UH TO A DIFFERENT ZOOM LEVEL TO GET BETTER RESULTS
I MEAN IT WOULD BEHAVE STRANGELY IN THE EYES OF THE USER
I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE BUT I'M NOT HAVING CRASHES AT THE MOMENT
SO WHAT I'M HAVING IS SO WE WE HAD A WE HAD A LONG PROBLEM ABOUT NOT FINDING OUT WHY THE TIME SYNCHING UP BETWEEN THE RELATIVE TIME IN IN A IN A SORT OF IN A IN A SUMMARISED SECTION AND THE ABSOLUTE TIME DIDN'T CORRESPOND AND STUFF
AND WE FOUND IT WAS SOME STUPID WELL
AT THE MOMENT OUR BEST GUESS IS THAT IT WAS SOME STUPID JAVA THING ABOUT IF YOU IF YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE TWO OBJECTS AND YOU SAY OBJECT IF YOU SAY A. EQUALS B.
THEY ACTUALLY REFERENCE TO THE SAME THING
SO ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO ONE ARE MADE TO THE OTHER AND IF YOU DO THAT AROUND FIVE CORNERS
YOU LOSE TRACK OF IT AND YOU SUDDENLY WONDER WHY THAT VALUE IS ZERO
AND IT TURNS OUT IT IS ZERO BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME THING THAT YOU ANYWAY UH SO WE FIGURED OUT IT'S INTERESTING
WHY DON'T I HAVE A SCREEN HERE NOW ACTUALLY THAT'S NEW BUT THAT'S OKAY
IT'S DOING DIFFERENT THINGS ALL THE TIME
LIKE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ACTUALLY THE BUT UH UH THAT SHOULD BE OKAY THAT SHOULD BE OKAY
I'LL I'LL BE ABLE TO
YEAH BUT LAST TIME I PRESSED THAT KEY COMBINATION EVERYTHING WENT WRONG AND I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT JUST FINE ON THE SCREEN
SO THAT'LL PROBABLY KEEP ME FROM POINTING ON MY SCREEN WHICH I USUALLY IT MIGHT JUST BE AT THIS POINT
LIKE THERE'S SOMETIMES A POINT TO LOADING NOT USUALLY THAT LONG
WELL LET'S SEE
ANYWAY SO N UH LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS
IN THE END WE DID GET IT WORKING BEFORE
OH SEE I GET YEAH
YEAH
AH SO NOW I'M HAVING A COMPLETE MESS OF LIKE SPLIT
SPLIT SCREENS AND STUFF
I THINK LAST TIME YES BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT IS IT
SO BUT I THINK IF I THIS IS A LOG OUT COMMAND AND USUALLY IT RESETS THIS AMAZING STRANGE COLOUR COMBINATIONS I SEE IN FRONT OF ME AT THE MOMENT
YEAH WE SOMEHOW ALWAYS GET IT WORKING BUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS EVERY TIME
UM
SO THAT KEPT US LIKE BASICALLY FROM DOING ANYTHING ELSE PRODUCT QU FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN THE LAST DAYS BECAUSE WE WERE UM HUNTING DOWN THAT STUPID ERROR
I GOT IT FIXED IN THE LAST WHATEVER ONE HOUR OR SOMETHING
BUT SO AT THE MOMENT THE PROGRAM IS SORT OF IN BETWEEN WORKING AND NOT WORKING BECAUSE WE'VE DONE LOTS OF CHANGES TO WHAT THE ERROR WAS
DAVE I THINK ACTUALLY THAT THE SUMMARY AT THE CURRENT MOMENT ISN'T WORKING A HUNDRED PERCENT CORRECT
BUT THAT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE INPUT DATA
IT SEEMS TO JUST TAKE THE FIRST UTTERANCES MORE OR LESS
LIKE IF YOU IF YOU FIRST IF YOU READ THROUGH THE SUMMARIES THEY READ SUSPICIOUSLY FLUENT LIKE AS IN PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
AND THEN IF YOU PLOT THEM ON THE SCREEN WHERE WHERE THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT THEY SEEM TO O
YES
SO MAYBE THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS COMING FROM
YEAH
UM
SO THIS IS WHEN YOU START SHIFTING AROUND YOUR LAPTOP TO THINK THAT IT GETS SOMEHOW LESS SLOPED ON THE SCREEN
UM
SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THIS MEETING IS ABOUT TO BE HONEST
UM I'M I'M GONNA SHOW THIS JUST WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT BUT IT NOT GONNA LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAD LAST TIME
DON'T ASK HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PROMISE THAT YOU'LL GET YOUR SCRIPT WHERE YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN STUFF BECAUSE ACTUALLY THAT WAS SORT OF READY BUT THEN WE SORT STARTED TRYING TO GET SOMETHING MORE WORKING AND THEN WE GOT INTO BIG PROBLEMS
SO AT THE MOMENT I MEAN AGAIN WE SHOULD BE AT A STATE WHERE PEOPLE CAN LOAD THEIR OWN SC OKAY
YEAH
THING IS A AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST REALLY BAD FOR ME
BUT FROM MONDAY ON I CAN JUST DO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR THIS ONE UNTIL IT UNTIL IT'S DUE
BUT UNTIL MONDAY IT'S GONNA BE REALLY BAD
LIKE I CAN PROBABLY HELP PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH GETTING GETTING WHAT WE HAVE RUNNING NOW
BUT
OKAY
SO I'LL JUST START IT UP WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE AND STUFF
HUH
EEK
YEAH IT DOESN'T
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE WHATEVER YOU GET AND THEN JUST SEE HOW FAR THAT GETS YOU
BUT WOULD THAT NOT HAPPEN AT SOME SORRY I'M JUM JUMPING IN
WOULD THAT NOT HAPPEN AT SUMMARISATION ANYWAY EVEN IF THEY'RE IN THE W LIKE WITH THE ONES THAT HAVE NO WORDS AND THEN NOT HAVE REALLY LOW INFORMATION DENSITY OR SOMETHING
HMM
'CAUSE YOU'D RECKON THAT YOU COULD LEAVE THEM IN AND THEY WOULD NEVER SHOW UP IN A SUMMARY ANYWAY
WE WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT IF WE JUST WRITE THE PROGRAMME THE WAY THAT EVEN IN THE P WAY THAT IT DISPLAYS EVERYTHING IT STILL LEAVES THOSE OUT
LIKE IF WE THOSE A SPECIAL INFORMATION DENSITY I. D. OR IF YOU JUST PUT A SPE YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THEN JUST MAKE SURE THAT SUMMARY EVEN IN THE IN THE MOST SUMMARISED MODE JUST NEVER PUTS THEM IN
HMM
'KAY SHALL WE TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE CURRENT SYS
SORRY
YEAH IT IS ACTUALLY
IT IS IT IS JUMPING NOW
SORRY
YEAH IT DID S IT DID SUMMARISE JUST NOW
IT'S JUST IT'S SUMMARISING STUPIDLY BUT AT LEAST IT'S JUMPING
SHALL
YES AND IN FACT AT THE MOMENT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH OF THE TWO I'M SUMMARISING OVER
DO YOU KNOW Y ARE W ARE WE UM SO AT THE MOMENT THE CONFIGURATION IS THAT WORD IMPORTANCE FILE IS TEST THREE AND T. D. I. D. F. FILE IS TEST TWO
I'VE JUST I'VE JUST SWITCHED THEM AROUND
SO I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING AT THE MOMENT
YEAH ESPECIALLY SINCE I'VE JUST ESPECIALLY S SINCE I'VE JUST SWITCHED THEM AROUND ANYWAY
BUT THAT'S OKAY
I BY THE WAY I READ A PAPER WHICH MAKES AN IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT COMBINING TWO THINGS OF THAT TYPE
UM THAT'S BASICALLY IT'S IT'S T GOING ON ABOUT THIS FANCY CALLED GEOMETRIC MEAN WHICH EFFECTIVELY JUST MEANS MULTIPLYING THEM
BUT I I HAVE SOME GOOD F INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS HOW YOU CAN SORT OF WEIGHT TWO DIFFERENT FACTORS
BECAUSE IT'S UH LIKE IT IT'S FOR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR
SOMEBODY WOULD TRY TO SOLVE A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM WHERE THEY ALSO HAD TWO FACTORS SORT OF AND THEY WANT TO WEIGH THEM TOGETHER
AND THERE IS LIKE A GOOD JUSTIFIABLE REASON UM WHY WE SHOULD DO IN A CERTAIN WAY AND HOW WE CAN THEN WITH A SIMPLE PARAMETER ADJUST HOW MUCH ONE WEIGHS AND HOW MUCH THE OTHER WEIGHS
SO THERE IS SOMETHING FOR JUST FOR PUTTING THEM TOGETHER IN A RELATIVELY SIMPLE WAY BUT STILL A WAY THAT WE CAN SORT OF JUSTIFY
UM AND WE CAN QUOTE STUFF ON THAT
YEAH SURE WE HMM
NO IT'S MULTIPLYING THEM AND AND LIKE PUTTING THEM ONE OVER THE POWER OF SOMETHING AND THE OTHER OVER MINUS ONE ONE MINUS THE POWER OF SOMETHING
AND THAT'S SORT OF AND THEY THEY'VE PLOTTED SOME GRAPHS ABOUT LIKE WHERE THEY SHOW F LIKE ONE GOING FROM ZERO TO THE ONE AND THE OTHER GOING ZERO TO ONE AND LIKE HOW THE HOW THE LANDSCAPE CHANGES AND HOW I THE PARAMETER CHANGES
HOW IT WORKS
SO IT'S QUITE GOOD
UM SO THAT'S PROBABLY SEEING THAT WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA GO INTO ANY WHATEVER BASE BLAH BLAH BLAH MARKOV MODEL BLAH BLAH BLAH ABOUT F COMBINING THEM
UM THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE GO AT
NOW THIS IS STILL NOT IDEAL AT THE MOMENT DAVE
IT'S IT'S SORT OF IT'S OVERRUNNING THE F LIKE IT SO OKAY SO AT THE MOMENT WE'RE THAT FAR THAT IF I NOW CLICK ONTO A SEGMENT HITS
YEAH IT'S JUST WAIT SORRY I JUST RE SIZED IT A BIT
YEAH SO IT'S J LIKE THE VALUES ARE SORT OF HARD CODED FOR THE SCREEN SIZES IN DICE AND MY SCREEN'S SMALLER
SO LET'S SEE I WAS A STUPID USER AND WAS CLICKING ON THIS SEGMENT
WE PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SEGMENT LINES A LOT BIGGER
SO THEN I H I DID I GET A NEW SUMMARISATION
YEAH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE
SO LET ME CHECK A DIFFERENT ONE
YEAH SO YOU SEE IT'S A DIFFERENT TEXT
AND YOU SEE IT IT'S RUNNING THROUGH IT
AND ALSO YOU SEE THE INDICATOR IN WHERE WE ARE IS JUMPING
SO IT'S IT'S SKIPPING STUFF
NOW I DON'T THINK THE SUMMARY AT THE MOMENT IS WHAT WE WANTED TO BE SEEING THE WORDS LIKE OH AND MM AND EXACTLY EXACTLY RIGHT SURE
THIS SEEMS PROBABLY SH THIS IS AGAIN PROBABLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE WANT
SO IT'S PROBABLY SOME VALUE THAT YOU HAVE TO LIKE DIVIDE BY ONE UH ONE DIVIDE BY THE VALUE OF SOMETHING
BUT
YES BUT ALSO EVERY OTHER WORD IN THAT SENTENCE WE SHOULD LOOK AT ARE PROBABLY IN YOUR LIST OF FIFTY LIKE LIST OF ALL IMPORTANT WORDS IN THE UNIVERSE
SO YES BUT IT'S PROBABLY JUST BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE
LIKE THIS IS JUST THEIR BEST SENTENCE FOR LIKE HAVING FUNCTION WORDS IN A ROW SORT OF AND EVERY O OTHER I MEAN THIS ONE IS SORT OF THE DEVELOPING A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE
SO MAYBE IT'S JUST DOING IT RANDOMLY AT THE MOMENT
I DON'T KNOW
BUT WE HAVE SOME SUMMARY WORKING AND THAT'S A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM
IF I PROMISE NOW THAT YOU'LL GET SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN PUT YOUR OWN DATA AND THAT'S SORT OF RINGING A BIT HOLLOW
YEAH
YEAH UH STILL IT'S UH IT IT'S MIGHT BE HAVING SOME PROBLEM
I THINK THIS ONE OVER RAN JUST BEFORE
SO WE MIGHT STILL HAVE SOME PROBLEM HERE THAT IT'S NOT STOPPING AT THE END BUT SO DAVE
CAN YOU MAKE THE PROMISE EVEN I'M NOT MAKING THE PROMISE REALISTICALLY THAT THE GIRLS WILL VERY SOON GET
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
S
S SO AT THE MOMENT I'VE HARD CODED IT TO JUST UM TAKING ONE TENTH OF THE NUMBER OF UTTERANCES WHICH WERE IN THE ORIGINAL SELECTION
YEAH
IT ACTUALLY IT GIVES YOU AN ERROR IF YOU PUT IT TO TWENTY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME THINGS IN THERE WHICH ARE SHORTER THAN TWENTY
AND IF YOU SELECT THOSE THAN IT'S HAVING AN
YEAH
BUT I THINK LIKE A B A PROPORTIONAL ONE IS PROBABLY NOT BAD IDEA
THAT'S BL I MEAN AN AN ABSOLUTE LENGTH IS SORT OF A BIT STRANGE BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT SOME UTTERANCES WILL NOT BE CHANGED IN LENGTH
I KNOW BUT WE HAD THAT DISCUSSION BEFORE AND I'M CONFUSED MYSELF ABOUT WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT
SO THE FACT THAT THIS IS GOING ON BEYOND THAT GREEN LINE HERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IDEAL BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO SORT OUT
BUT THIS IS WORKING IN GENERAL
DOES ANYONE HAVE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OVER THE WHOLE TIME ISSUE LIKE AS IN WHAT DATE IS IT TODAY
WHAT DATE DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS PRESENTED WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK IS THAT AND ISSUES LIKE THAT
SO THE PRESENTATION IS NOW SH TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY
'KAY
ONE WEEK FROM TODAY I SHALL HEAR THE FREEDOM RING FROM THE HILLS AND AND EVERYTHING AND SHALL THEN THROW MYSELF INTO NEW SLAVERY
AH
NO REALLY
AND THE REPORT
WRITING THE REPORT WON'T BE SO BAD
HOW LONG IS IT EXPECTED TO BE
I KNOW BUT UH IF EVERYONE LIKE IF EVERYONE IS MANAGING THREE PAGES FOR THEIR BIT THEN THAT'S GONNA BE THAT THAT'S A BIG REPORT THEN
AND STUFF
SO YEAH BUT EVALUATION
AH
YOU THINK
WE SHOULD PROBABLY INQUIRE ABOUT THAT OR LIKE INTEGRATE TOOL TIPS THAT WOULD BE VISIBLE
HAVING SAID THAT DAVE WE COULD PROBABLY W LIKE IF WE WANT
WE COULD PROBABLY GO BACK TO THE C UM TO THE GROUP DIRECTORY AND JUST USE THIS TRICK
IT REALLY SEEMS TO BE ALL ABOUT STARTING IN THE DIRECTORY
BUT I MEAN IF IF THE TWO OF US ARE JUST WORKING ON IT IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE 'CAUSE I'VE ALREADY MOUNTED YOUR DIRECTORY NOW
SO AND PROBABLY
MM
WHAT
WELL IF IT'S JUST MULTIPLYING TO NUMBERS
IT CAN BE DONE IN THE PROGRAMME 'CAUSE THEN WE CAN UM BECAUSE WHAT WE COULD DO IS HAVE A SLIDE BAR WHERE WE CAN ADJUST THIS VALUE
ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY LIKE HOW BASICALLY A GENERAL WAY BECAUSE THERE'S AT LEAST TWO POINTS AT WHICH WE ARE INTERESTED IN THAT
HOW WE CAN JUST HAVE A SLIDE BAR WHICH WE CAN READ AND WRITE TO WHICH IS IN A FRAME OF THAT TYPE
THAT WOULD BE GOOD
IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT SHOULD IT
I MEAN SHOULD JUST BE
YEAH BUT IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFI UH LET'S SEE IT YOU COULD IF YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU PROBABLY HAVE JUST TO EXTEND THAT CLASS AND THEN YOU CAN WORK WITH THAT VALUE
BUT IF YOU'RE UNLUCKY IT MIGHT BE QUICKER TO JUST WRITE A VERY SIMPLE STRING COMPONENT WHICH IS JUST THE S JUST A BAR
YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO BECAUSE WE'D BASICALLY IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ONES TO PLAY AROUND WITH
ONE FOR CONTROLLING THE LENGTH OF THE SUMMARY AND ANOTHER ONE FOR
UM FOR THE MERGING FACTOR IF WE DO IT THAT WAY WITH THE CHI METRIC
YEAH YEAH
IT'S IT'S JUST A SINGLE FORMULA EFFECTIVELY YEAH
UM HOW IS THE AUDIO THING GOING
IS THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY NOT HAD TIME TO WORK ON THAT
'KAY IT SEEMS THAT AT THE MOMENT A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT HAS TO BE DONE AT SORT OF AT THE MOMENT I'M SAYING OH DAVE
CAN YOU DO THAT
SO THAT'S NOT IDEAL
OH
OKAY
'CAUSE I THINK I MEAN THE AUDIO IS A V IN THE END THE AUDIO IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF IT
JUST BECAUSE IT'S IT'S GONNA LOOK STUPID IF WE HAVE EVERYTHING WORKING BUT JUST IF
THE SPEECH TOOLS
HMM
IS THERE ANY WAY FOR X. FORWARDING SOUND
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE SORT OF THE NICE WAY TO SIT AT HOME AND HAVE IT FORWARD THE SOUND AT THE LOWEST BIT RATE TO YOU
I MEAN SEEING THAT IT'S OVER BROAD BAND IT'S FORWARDING THE GRAPHICS QUITE OKAY IT WOULD PROBABLY LIKE BROAD BAND WISE BAND WIDTH WISE PROBABLY WORK OUT
BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT AND UH NOT A SIMPLE THING
HMM
Y ARE YOU NOT CREATING FILES ANYWHERE LIKE SORT OF REAL FILES
SO THAT YOU CAN DO ON A DICE MACHINE INDEPENDENT OF W
YEAH
ONE PROBLEM WITH S. S. H. ING IN GENERAL IS THAT THE MACHINE THAT LIKE ON THE ONLY GATEWAY MACHINES THEY HATE YOU FOR DOING ANYTHING ON THEM
AND THERE'S NO SIMPLE WAY AT LEAST I HAVEN'T FOUND ONE TO DIRECTLY IN IN A SINGLE STEP SORT OF S. S. H. AND THEN S. S. H. AGAIN
WELL ACTUALLY I GUESS IF YOU PUT S. S. H. AND YOU KNOW C YOU CAN GIVE A COMMAND OUTRIGHT AFTER WITH S. S. H.
SO IF THAT C COMMAND IS S. S. H. AGAIN AND IF YOU THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE ALL YOUR KEY FILES SET CORRECTLY
WHICH I HAVEN'T BECAUSE IT ALWAYS FUCKS UP ON MY SYSTEM
MAYBE IF YOU GET THAT WORKING THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIRECTLY GO INTO ANOTHER MACHINE
UH
YEAH
YEAH
'CAUSE A P A PRIMITIVE VERSION OF THE SOUND TO HAVE RELATIVELY SOON WOULD BE GOOD
I THINK
OK OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY GOOD
SO TO COME BACK TO THE PROBLEM WE HAD BEFORE
SO THE REASON WHY THE SUMMARY DIDN'T WORK WELL IN THE LAST ONE AND WORKS WELL NOW IS BECAUSE BASED ON THE BOTTOM DATA THE DATA IS SO HOMOGENEOUSLY HIGH IN ITS IMP IMPORTANCE RATING THAT IT JUST SORT OF THEN
EVERYTHING ELSE BEING EQUAL IT TOOK THE FIRST ONES MORE OR LESS
BUT NOW IT'S WORKING BETTER BECAUSE NOW IT'S ON A MUCH MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED
WELL
THE MOST PROFESSIONAL WAY OF DOING IT WOULD BE TO MAP THEM ACCORDING TO THE STANDARD DEVIATION 'CAUSE THAT WAY IT AU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ALWAYS THAT'S SORT OF LIKE IT IT'S THE PROBLEM IS IT'S MORE CALCULATION EXPENSIVE AND SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED EVEN THOUGH IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE IN TERMS OF CALCULATION IT'S NOT MUCH HEAVIER
BUT LIKE YOU KNOW GENERALLY ABOUT STANDARD DEVIATION
YEAH IT'S IT'S A G IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SIMPLE FORMU IT'S BASICALLY JUST WHATEVER THE AVERAGE OF R MEAN SQUARE DIFFERENCES FROM THE MEAN OR SOMETHING
WHICH THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT GENERALLY YOU FIRST HAVE TO GET THE MEAN AND ONLY T ONLY ONCE YOU HAVE THE MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT
IN ONE GO
YEAH I'VE DERIVED THAT I'VE DERIVED THAT MYSELF
LIKE I DIDN'T FIND IT SO I DID IT MYSELF AND IT TOOK ME A DAY WITH THE FORMULA
BUT THEN I'M SLOW AT MATHS
SO THE THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT WOULD BE THAT IF YOU SIMPLY SAY THAT WHATEVER
ONE STANDARD DEVIATION BELOW THE MEAN IS ZERO AND ONE STANDARD DEVIATION ABOVE THE MEAN IS ONE OR TWO STANDARD DEVIATIONS OR SOMETHING
THEN WHATEVER THE DATA IS LIKE IT WOULD ALWAYS NORMALISE
YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT THE SIMPLEST
BUT THAT LIKE THAT'S THE MOST PROFESSIONAL WAY I CAN THINK ABOUT IT
Y THAT WOULD INDIRECTLY ALSO DROP STUFF
I MEAN THAT WOULD DROP WHATEVER IS BELOW OR ABOVE
SO IF YOU FIND THAT FORMULA THAT WOULD BE GOOD
OTHERWISE I CAN SEE IF I CAN STILL UNDERSTAND LIKE I DID IT IN MY PROGRAMME
IT'S UH IT'S REALLY STUPID
LIKE THE STANDARD STANDARD DEVIATION FORMULA JUST REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE THE MEAN INITIALLY
AND THAT MAKES SOME THINGS EXACTLY TWICE AS COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE AND THERE IS A WAY OF DOING IT CUMULA CUMULATIVELY
HMM
SO YEAH SO THAT'S ONE POSSIBLE WAY OF DOING THAT
SO THE
AND THAT'S JUST IN THE LOADING STAGE RIGHT
YEAH THAT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE FINE ESPECIALLY IN THE WORST CASE WE JUST INTRODUCE A SMALL HOUR GLASS
BUT ANYWAY WE ONLY WE ONLY GONNA PRESENT THIS ONCE AND WE CAN PROBABLY JUST LIKE SORT OF START IT UP BEFORE THE PRESENTATION STARTS
SO IF WE SHOULDN'T AT ALL BE WORRIED ABOUT IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE BEAUTIFUL
IT'S LIKE IF YOU B WANT A PROGRAMME ONLY TO RUN ONCE AND ONLY A PART OF IT
YOU DON'T WORRY IF IT CRASHES AFTERWARDS IF IT WASTES ALL THE RESOURCES IF IT FORMATS THE HARD DISK IN THE END
ANYWAY I'M RAMBLING ON
UM
D
NO IT DOES NOT IT DOES NOT IF Y I CHANGED IT
I JUST
SO YOU WOULD FORGET THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD START IT FIFTEEN TIMES OVER AND HAVE FIFTEEN ZOMBIES RUNNING
UM
DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHICH DICE MACHINES HAVE SOUND CARDS AND HOW TO FIND THEM
'CAUSE THE THING IS WE CAN LIKE THIS AT THE MOMENT WOR IS WORKING BECAUSE IT HAS A SOUND CARD
THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S STRUCTURE OF THIS IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO JUST SAY WELL IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUND CARD YOU DON'T HAVE SOUND
AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S WHAT I REMEMBER OUR PROBLEM WAS THAT
YEAH
NO
SO I'VE WORKED AROUND THAT THERE IS WAYS I THINK TO GET AROUND IT BUT THE PROBLEM IS
SO YOU B YOU BASICALLY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO CODE VERSIONS THEN
ONE FOR SOUND CARD AND ONE FOR NON SOUND CARD MACHINES TO TEST IT ON
UM BECAUSE IT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUND CARD
SO THERE ISN'T A SIMPLE WAY TO JUST TELL WHICH ONES THE SOUND CARD MACHINES ARE AND JUST TO USE SOUND CARD MACHINES IS THERE
WE
NO BUT I GUESS I MEAN IF YOU JUST IF YOU TRUST IN DAVE'S SUMMARY FOR THE AUDIO
JUST PUTTING ALL THESE THINGS INTO SOUND THEN THEN HAVING A WRITTEN SUMMARY
YEAH YEAH
SO THE YEAH
YEAH
SO I THINK DAVE REALLY THE EASIEST WAY IS IF YOU JUST MAKE A SOUND CARD AND A NON SOUND CARD VERSION OF IT
BECAUSE
YEAH BUT THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE GIRLS CAN'T TEST IT
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
LIKE
YES BUT WITHOUT THE CLOCK YOU DON'T HAVE WELL ACTUALLY YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOESN'T LIKE F IT DOESN'T STRICTLY HAVE TO DO ANY MOVEMENT IN IT YEAH
YEAH BUT WE HAVE TO COMMENT STUFF OUT FOR THAT I THINK
LIKE AT THE MOMENT IF YOU CLICK ON A SEGMENT IT AUTOMATICALLY SETS THE WHOLE CLOCK THING GOING AND STUFF
SO WE HAVE TO COMMENT OUT STUFF
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING THAT THERE IS WE COULD MAKE IT THAT A FLAG COULDN'T WE
WE COULD JUST MAKE THAT UH LIKE A RUN TIME FLAG AND THEN MAKE A FEW IFS AND SAY IF
YES THE P THERE IS
YEAH
YEAH
SO ANYWAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE IT SEEMS JUST THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF DICE MACHINES DON'T HAVE SOUND CARD
NO NOTHING C MUCH TO TALK ABOUT THIS
SO APART FROM LIKE UH A SEARCH BOX AND THE SIMILARITY THING F ONCE THAT KICKS OFF
W WHICH IS GONNA BE HORRIBLE BUT UM THIS IS MORE OR LESS IN THE END
LIKE THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT OUR PRODUCT WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE END
SEEING THAT REALISTICALLY WITH THE GIVEN TIME FRAME WE'RE NOT GONNA DO AMAZING NEW THINGS FROM NOW ON
SO I MEAN WE'LL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE T
HUH
LIST OF AGREEMENTS
OKAY YEAH
OKAY
UH YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD DAVE'S RIGHT
IT COULD BE GOOD IN THE DISPLAY TO ANNOTATE THEM IN THE DISPLAY IF WE CAN
YEAH WE COULD JUST MAKE
NOT JUST YET
BUT THAT SHOULD THAT'S ACTUALLY THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY I CAN SAY I CAN DO THIS WEEK BECAUSE THAT SHOULD BE I MEAN I'LL DO IT IN AN INEFFICIENT WAY
I'LL EFFECTIVELY SORT OF GO THROUGH ALL THE SEGMENTS AND CHECK IF THEY'RE CLICKED ON
BUT I THINK DAVE WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS THAT TH UH THE TIME CLICK OF THE CLOCK I THINK THAT'S CHANGEABLE
AND I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY INCREASE THAT
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S ZERO POINT ONE SECONDS AND THAT'S JUST THERE IS ACTUALLY THERE ARE SOME BACKGROUND NOISE WHEN IT'S WORKING AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE DOING SO MUCH EVERY TIME
YEAH IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU D I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE THE VERSION WHERE THE DISPLAY YET
WHERE THE DISPLAY IS ACTUALLY UPDATING UP HERE WHEN IT'S MOVING ON
SO I MEAN YES IT IS BECAUSE MY DISPLAY IS PROGRAMMED INEFFICIENTLY
BUT I THINK WITH THE T GIVEN TIME CONSTRAINTS IT'S PROBABLY EASIER INSTEAD OF MAKING A VERY EFFICIENT DISPLAY CODE TO JUST MAKE THE TIME MAKE THE CLOCK WHATEVER
ZERO POINT FIVE SECONDS OR SOMETHING
DO YOU WANT THE MONITOR
IF I CAN SKIP MORE ACCURATELY THEN
UH YOU'RE
THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S COMING FROM MY RESOLUTION AND IT'S YOU HAVE A MUCH HIGHER RESOLUTION
SO
AGAIN I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD PART IF WE HAD A SLIDE B UM BAR INITIALLY WHERE WE COULD DYNAMICALLY ADAPT THE THRESHOLD OF WHAT WE YEAH
SO MAYBE IT'S JUST LIKE MAYBE B IT'S JUST GOOD TO HAVE LIKE SOME GENERIC COMPONENT WITH THREE SLIDE BARS OR SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN RELATIVELY EASILY ADD A FOURTH ONE OR SOMETHING
YOU KNOW AND JUST LIKE SORT OF ALL OUR FIDDLE FACTORS
UM BECAUSE
UH WELL IT DEPENDS WE WE COULD LIKE IN SOME CASES WE COULD PUT IT AS A FEATURE AND SAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN DYNAMICALLY
LIKE
WE WOULDN'T CALL IT THRESHOLD WE WOULD SORT OF LIKE THE GRANULARITY OF DECISION OR SOMETHING LIKE IT
SO AND YEAH AND EVERY AND EVERYTHING ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD I COULD THEN ADD THE UTTERANCE WHERE IT OCCURS
JUST PUT A CERTAIN GRAPHICAL ITEM LIKE A HANDSHAKE OR SOMETHING COOL
YEAH RIGHT
MM
YES I WAS J IT I WAS JUST THINKING THE SAME LIKE IT'S IT'S SO TEMPTING
LIKE WE WE'LL WE'LL HAVE YELLOW WE'LL HAVE YELLOW SMILIES AND YELLOW ANGRY FACES
AH BEAUTIFUL
DIDN'T SOMEBODY SAY THAT ACTUALLY LIKE A LOT OF AGREEMENTS HAVE HAVE ACTUAL WORDS WHICH SHOULD SUGGEST DISAGREEMENT LIKE
YEAH
YEAH
IF THEY'RE CORRESPONDING EA FOR EACH THING YEAH THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT
SO FOR EACH UTTERANCE YOU HAVE ONE AGREEMENT AND ONE DISAGREEMENT SCORE
UH SOMETHING LIKE IT
OKAY YEAH
THE ONE WHERE WE CURRENT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU CAN IF YOU INTRODUCE UM LIKE A SORT OF A STATIC WHAT'S IT CALLED PUBLIC STATIC INT
SO BASICALLY A CONSTANT LIKE THAT'S JAVA'S TYPE OF A CONSTANT AND GIVE THEM NAMES LIKE SO ZERO T. D. I. D. F.
ONE THAT PROBABLY MAKES THE CODE A LOT MORE READABLE FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S PLAYING AROUND WITH IT
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
SO JUST LIKE WHATEVER THREE MEANS AGREEMENT VALUE AND THEN I'D JUST WRITE SOMETHING AGREEMENT
AND THEN IT'S EASIER TO UNDERSTAND FOR BOTH OF US WHAT'S GOING ON
HMM
I WOULD ALSO TH YEAH BUT I WOULD ALSO TH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD PUT THE THRESHOLD FOR THAT ONE IN THE END QUITE HIGH ANYWAY
SO PROBABLY IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
BECAUSE I THINK THIS THING
NO BUT LIKE
BUT I MEAN THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT ONES HAVE THE SAME NUMBER IN ITSELF ISN'T A PROBLEM IS IT
SO IF IF FOR EVERY YEP YOU'D BE SURE THAT IT'S AN AGREEMENT THAN THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE NOT SURE IF EVERY YEP IS AN AGREEMENT OR
HMM
SO OVER OVER HOW MANY DIFFERENT OVER WHICH LENGTH IS THIS
NOW THIS IS LIKE SO THE THIRD COLUMN IS THE UTTERANCE WHERE IT OCCURS RIGHT
OKAY SO W I THINK WE REALLY DO HAVE TO PUT THE THRESHOLD QUITE QUITE HIGH THEN BECAUSE
YES 'CAUSE IT I WAS JUST I WAS JUST CHECKING YOU KNOW LIKE HOW FAR APART ARE THEY
AND AT THE MOMENT THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT A GOOD THING TO DISPLAY IF THEY'RE LIKE AN AVERAGE TEN TEN UTTERANCES APART OR SOMETHING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AGAIN
I'D SAY PROBABLY A GOOD WAY OF GOING ABOUT THAT QUESTION IS TO HAVE A CONTROL WHICH WE CAN VARY IN THE DIS AND THEN JUST SORT OF BECAUSE THAT'S IN THE END HOW IT'S GONNA BE EVALUATED
YOU KNOW IN THE END IT THIS IS GONNA LI I MEAN WE'RE GONNA PRESENT IT AND SAY YEAH SO THIS OUR IT SHOWS DISAGREEMENTS
AND THEN WE SEE WHAT WHAT LOOKS GOOD AND WHAT LOOKS I THINK PROBABLY IT LOOKS CREDIBLE IF LIKE AN U IF EVERY SORT OF EVERY TOPIC SEGMENT HAS UM W YEAH
OR LIKE OR LIKE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN THE THREE AND AND FIVE AGREEMENTS BUT NOT MORE
OR PROBABLY MAYBE LESS BUT NOT MUCH LESS AND ACTUALLY THE I THINK THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ONE IN EVERYTHING
N YES BUT MAYBE IN AN EXPENSIVE WAY OR MAYBE IN A STUPID LOOKING WAY THOUGH
UM
YEAH D I'M YEAH I WAS JUST THINKING THAT IT CAN ACT IT CAN PROBABLY BE DONE ON DISPLAY LEVEL
THIS ONE CRASHED
MINE JUST CRASHED I THINK WHICH IS BAD
IT PROBABLY JUST IT KEPT ON PLAYING AND NOW REACHED SOME WHATEVER
MY GOD
YEAH
I THINK SORT OF THE BOTTOM LINE AND WHICH MIGHT WELL END UP WHAT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE IS THAT WE TAKE THE SINGLE HIGHEST RANKED UTTERANCE AND PUT THAT AS A T AS A TITLE
LIKE REALISTICALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT TO DO THIS AND STUFF
THERE W
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE EVEN ON A S ON A SING LIKE I IS THAT ON A R LIKE IS THAT ON A WORD BASIS WOULD THAT BE SINGLE WORDS
OR WOULD THAT BE
'CAUSE BE CHECK OUT WHAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE ON A WORD BASIS
MAYBE ACTUALLY IF IT IF THERE'S ONE WORD WHICH IS VERY TYPICAL I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY SOME WORD LIKE UH
BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE THE ONLY TIME THAT UH WAS SPELLED WITH THREE A. AND STUFF
I THINK THAT ACTUALLY THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM OF THE WHOLE UM ANNOTATION THAT IF THEY AREN'T EXACTLY CONSISTENT IN HOW THEY DESCRI UH TRANSCRIBE STUFF LIKE THAT
THEN WE PROBABLY CAN'T YEAH
'CAUSE THAT'S WHEN WE'RE THINKING SOMETIMES LIKE WHY IS MM HIGH
BUT THEN PROBABLY IT'S THE ONLY TIME THAT MM WAS SPELLED WITH A DOT AT THE END AND STUFF
SO BUT YEAH LIKE IF IF SINGLE W
I C I HAVE DICTIONARIES
IF IT'S JUST LIKE I HAVE ARBITRARILY LONG LISTS FROM THE BRITISH NATIONAL CORPUS OF WHEN T USUALLY
WELL LET'S SAY AT LEAST THEY DO IT UH CONSISTENTLY ENOUGH THAT I THINK YOU CAN FILTER THEM OUT FAIRLY WELL
YEAH SO IF YOU IF LIKE I MEAN IF THE SINGLE HA BEST ONE WORD FOR A FOR A SEGMENT IS INTERESTING THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD
SEEM TO BE HAVING
USE A RANDOM S
'KAY WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS HERE NOW IT SUDDENLY CRASHES AND HANGS
YEAH I MEAN THAT WAS THAT WAS SORT OF IN THE ORIGINAL OF THEN THE NICE FANCY DRAWINGS THAT WE GAVE STEVEN
I MEAN THAT WAS PART OF IT THAT SORT OF WITHIN THE SEGMENT YOU HAD THESE SUB SEGMENTS AND EACH OF THEM HAD DIFFERENT WORDS AND WHATEVER HAPPENED TO OUR DREAMS
ARE THERE ASSIGNMENTS
NO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
YEAH
HMM
POOR MAN'S SOLUTION IS PROBABLY GONNA BE TO HAVE A A LIST
OH SO J YOU YOU ARE THINK OF LOADING THEM ALL AT ONCE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
EVEN THOUGH WE
'KAY
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT LIKE THE DR THE DRAWING HAS TO BE CHANGED ANYWAY THE IT'S NOT IDEAL AT THE MOMENT
UM YEAH SO IF PERFORMANCE WISE IT GENERALLY WORKS FINE FOR THE DISPLAY IT SHOULDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
'CAUSE I THINK EVERYTHING IN THE DISPLAY CODE IS JUST FROM THE FIRST UNTIL THE LAST ONE DISPLAYED
SO IF IF THE OTHER PERFORMANCE IS OKAY THEN WE SHOULD REALLY JUST LOAD THE WHOLE THING IN
I'M VERY DIS
SEE THAT PROBABLY JUST MEANS THAT THE DISPLAY SORT OF HAS AN INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT LEVEL OF ZOOM IT HAS
SO INITIALLY THE DISPLAY
YES
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S PROBABLY FAIRLY SIMPLE TO DO ACTUALLY IF WE DO IT IN THAT MOST PRIMITIVE WAY OF JUST SAYING AS LONG AS YOU DISPLAY MORE THAN ONE MEETING
YEAH
WE THEN NEED SOME WAY OF GETTING BACK UP AGAIN IN THE HIERARCHY
BUT THAT IN THE WORST CASE IT WILL JUST BE A STATIC SORT OF ARROW UP BUTTON IN THE RIGHT HAND TOPPER CORNER OF THE DISPLAY
AND YOU PRESS THAT AND THEN YOU'RE ON THE DISPLAY THE WHOLE THING AGAIN
BUT FOR THAT AT THE MOMENT MY DISPLAY CODE NEEDS THAT THING TO WORK THE ONE OH NO THAT'S WORKING AT THE MOMENT ANYWAY
THE ONE THAT I JUST SAY GIVE ME ONE HUNDRED VALUES OVER THAT LENGTH AND THEN YOU'RE INTERNALLY OKAY
BUT YEAH BUT UH THAT'S OKAY AS LONG AS MY DISPLAY I WAS JUST THINKING MY DISPLAY CAN'T HANDLE DISPLAYING A MILLION DIFFERENT SEGMENTS
BUT NOW R NO BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
EVEN NOW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
OKAY WELL THAT'S ALL DETAILS
UM SO DAVE CAN YOU JUST TURN THIS WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IN
YEAH
MAKE
UH AND IF AN
IF ANYONE FEELS THAT THEY HAVE FREE TIME UH THIS IS A JOKE
UM ONE THING THAT WOULD BE CONVENIENT FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND WHICH I HAVEN'T FOUND OUT ABOUT IT IS HOW TO DO TOOL TIPS IN AN ARBITRARY WAY IN IN IN SWING GRAPHIC DISPLAYS
NOW THERE IS SIMPLE WAYS OF DOING TOOL TIPS OVER A GIVEN ELEMENT LIKE IF YOU HAVE A BUTTON AND YOU JUST GIVE IT A TOOL TIP TEXT
BUT THERE IS MEANS OF DOING TOOL TIPS THAT JUST I C I PUT MY MOUSE OVER
LET'S SAY I PUT MY MOUSE OVER THIS LINE HERE AND THEN IT WOULD TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IT IS
AND THAT WOULD BE QUITE CONVENIENT FOR A LOT OF THINGS BECAUSE THEN WE CAN SORT OF HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THE DISPLAY IN THE IN THE WAY THAT JUST WHEN THE MOUSE IS OVER IT
BUT I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW IT WORKS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY SO IF EVERYONE IS EVER BORED OR ANYONE FEELS THAT THEY CAN DO THAT
YES BUT
YEAH BUT THE THE THING IS IT IT ISN'T SIMPLY AN ACT OF SETTING A STRING DEFAULT TOOL TIP
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT A TOOL TIP OBJECT THAT YOU HAVE TO CREATE AND GIVE IT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND STUFF OR
YEAH
SO ANYWAY I HAVEN'T LOOKED MUCH INTO THAT
SO IF IF ANYBODY LOOKS INTO THAT THEN LET ME KNOW
OTHERWISE I'LL START LOOKING INTO IT AS SOON AS I HAVE TIME AGAIN
BUT IF ANYBODY
YEAH
I FOUND SOME STUFF ABOUT IT ON THE WEB AND IT JUST LOOKED TO ME LIKE PROPER CODING
LIKE I SAW HALF PAGE CODE SAMPLES WHICH EFFECTIVELY JUST DISPLAYED A TOOL TIP AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME AT THAT POINT TO GET DEEPER INTO THAT
SO IF ANYBODY GETS ANY GOOD SAMPLES OF THAT NEVER
ANYWAYS THAT IS THAT IT FOR NOW
NO BUT I'M GONNA I'M GOING UP APPLETON TOWER NOW AND I HAVE MY EXTERNAL HARD DISK
SO I CAN
YEAH
IS THERE ANY DICE MACHINES IN THIS BUILDING
FREELY ACCESSIBLE FOR ME
CAN YOU SHOW ME WHERE BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO APPLETON TOWER AT THE MOMENT
SO THEN I DON'T HAVE TO GO UP AND DOWN
ACTUALLY NO BUT I HAVE TO GO THERE ANYWAY AND PUT A PIECE OF PAPER ON TWO MACHINES WHERE SOME STUFF OF MINE IS RUNNING ON
YEAH AND I THINK LIKE I'LL JUST I'LL JUST KICK IN FULL TIME FOR N. L. S. S. D. NEXT WEEK 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING I HAVE TO DO THEN
APART FROM COGNITIVE MODELLING WHICH I THINK I'LL JUST DO IN FIVE HOURS THREE HOURS
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
HMM
I MIGHT JUST NOT GO FOR THE LAST QUESTION BECAUSE USUALLY THE LAST QUESTION IS TAKES HALF THE TIME AND GIVES YOU FIVE PERCENT OR SOMETHING LIKE OKAY
REALLY
OKAY
NO MAYBE HE HAS MENTIONED IT TO THEM BUT THEY JUST NEVER TALKED TO US
I MEAN WE DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
SO
IT'S SORT OF COMING AS A SHOCK TO ME NOW BECAUSE I WAS SORT OF IN THIS MINDSET
LIKE I FIRST KNEW OH THERE'S A LOT OF TIME BETWEEN THE PRESENTATION AND THE REPORT
AND THEN I KNEW OH NOW THE PRESENTATION IS SHIFTED
BUT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO FACTS THE INTERDEPENDENCIES THERE'S SOME FANCY PLANNING LANGUAGE ABOUT THAT
BUT THAT
YES IT'S UM IT'S PROBABLY SOME VERSION OF THE FRAME PROBLEM
FRAME PLOB PROBLEM
HASN'T BEEN CLEAR TO ME
WELL I RECKON THAT IT
I RECKON THAT PROBAB
BUT IF YOU JUST PRESENT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE THING IF YOU'RE NOT LIKE I DON'T THINK THIS PRESENTATION IS ABOUT THE INTERNAL WORKING
SO YEAH
SO FOR A DEMO I THINK REALISTICALLY SINCE EVERYTHING IN THIS UNIVERSITY SORT OF WORKS IN ONE HOUR SLOTS AND STUFF
SO IF IT'S TWO GROUPS THEN IT PROBABLY IT'S GONNA BE ROUGHLY HALF AN HOUR ISH
HMM
NO WHY IS TH THIS IS GONNA BE SO BAD
LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE SOME SMALL L
YEAH BUT THE PERFORMANCE IS REALLY BAD AT THE MOMENT ON THAT ONE THOUGH
PLUS WE WOULD HAVE TO GET THE SPEECH TOOLS RUNNING ON MY LAPTOP THEN WOULDN'T WE
MM
WELL LET'S LET'S SEE
DID IT IT COULD JUST BE FLUENT ON THE LAPTOP FOR ALL I KNOW
I MEAN LIKE AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT TOO BAD APART FROM I THINK THE SOUND IS STUTTERING AND THAT'S B I THINK BECAUSE OF THE LAPTOP
BUT WE CAN ONLY REALLY JUDGE THAT ONCE WE HAVE SOUND FILES
HOW FAST IS YOURS VERA
MM-HMM
WELL NET WOULD RUN ON ANYTHING
BUT
YES
NO THAT'S TRUE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
VIRTUAL MACHINE SHOULD BE FINE
BUT BUT BUT THAT ALL RELIES ON FINDING SOME WAY OF GETTING THE SPEECH TOOLS TO DO THEIR JOB
YEAH SEE THAT'S 'CAUSE THAT'S THE THING LIKE THAT WOULD RELY ON I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO RUN THE SPEECH TOOLS IN
NO NO NO NO D WHEREVER THIS IS GOING IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD
UM
WE CAN HE CAN USE MY LAPTOP AS SORT OF LIKE AS A AS A SERVER AS A SOUND SERVER
BUT THAT WOULD STILL MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO GET THE SPEECH TOOLS RUNNING ON THIS
NO YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN THE WAY JAVA WORKS IS THAT T
I THINK IT'LL RUN ON ON THEIR DICE MACHINE IF WE'RE DOING IT IN IF WE WELL WE SHOULD DEFINITELY TEST IT THE DAY BEFORE
YEAH
'KAY
SO DAVE ARE YOU GONNA MAKE SOMETHING PRIMITIVE THAT PEOPLE CAN LOAD THEIR DATA IN
OK
YEAH
YEAH
I'M NOT I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO MAKE IT WORK WITH THE TO MAKE IT NOT CRASH IF IT DOESN'T HAVE A SOUND CARD
THERE'S THERE'S QUITE A BIT YOU HAVE TO COMMENT OUT FOR THAT WHICH IS STUPID BECAUSE I
YEAH THE YEAH
NO BUT THE THING IS THE DISPLAY CALLS METHODS WHICH PROBABLY EXPECT SOME SO I THINK IF THE DISPLAY ITSELF ISN'T DOING ANYTHING CLOCKY
SO AS LONG AS IN THE MAIN PR IN THE PROGRAMME MANAGER EVERYTHING CLOCKY IS IS REMOVED
BUT UH I W IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TO CHECK HOW MUCH WORK IT WOULD BE TO DO IT OVER A FLAG
'CAUSE THEN IN THE END I 'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE ALWAYS HAVE TWO CODE VERSIONS AND PEOPLE MIGHT BE CHANGING THE WRONG ONE
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
I JUST I KNOW THAT LIKE IF YOU DON'T DO IT WITH THE EXCEPTIONS CRASHES
THAT'S WHAT FIGURED OUT
LIKE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SOUND CARD IT CRASHES EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE SOUND
YEAH OKAY COOL
UH I THINK THE DISPLAY HAS SOME METHOD FOR IT
I'M NOT ACTUALLY LIKE FOR THE PROGRAMME MANAGER THEN TO CALL
I'M NOT ACTUALLY A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT THE DISPLAY HAS SOME METHOD WHERE YOU TELL IT WHERE TO START AND WHERE TO END
YEAH OR THERE'S GONNA BE SOMETHING
WELL ACTUALLY DAVE DA DAVE DAVE DAVE
OKAY
NO SORRY I'VE UH I WAS WRONG I WAS THINKING IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE SAY SET SELECT NO IT DOES NOT
BUT ACTUALLY A SET SELECTION DOES EVERYTHING YOU WANT SORT OF
NO BUT SET SELECTION DOESN'T UPDATE THE DISPLAY THOUGH
BECAUSE WELL IT IT DOESN'T TELL THE DISPLAY WHICH PART TO DI WHICH PART TO TO DISPLAY BECAUSE THE DISPLAY HAS JUST CALLED SET SELECTION TO
IF
YEAH BUT THAT ONLY WORKS THAT AT THE MOMENT ISN'T DONE THROUGH OUR SYSTEM THAT'S JUST DONE BECAUSE THEN THE TIME CHANGES
SO ACTUALLY A TIME CHANGE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY PUT THE POSITION OF THE DISPLAY IN THE RIGHT PLAY
UH NO BUT THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THAT COULD WELL BE OUTSIDE THE DISPLAYED AREA THEN
YEAH
SO
YEAH
NO I THINK THE DISPLAY HAS A METHOD FOR THAT READY WHICH IS CALLED
ANYWAY THE DISPLAY HAS SOMETHING USEFUL FOR THAT
SOMETHING WHICH PROBABLY STARTS WITH THE WORD SET
YEAH YOU CAN SET THE WINDOW START UTTERANCE AND WINDOW END UTTERANCE
HMM
ALTERNATIVELY THERE'S ALWAYS THE METHOD OF JUST GIVING IT A REALLY HIGH SCORE
AS A HACK YOU KNOW LIKE JUST AS LONG AS YOU THEN DON'T WELL PROBABLY PEOPLE WOULDN'T KNOW
HMM
WELL YOU COULD YOU COULD PUT ONE POINT ONE WHEN THE OTHER ONES ONLY GO UP TO THE ONE
BUT NO IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A NICE WAY I'M JUST SAYING
YEAH PROBABLY THAT ACTUALLY TRUE THAT IF YOU'RE DOING A SEARCH YOU'RE USUALLY NOT INTERESTED IN A CONDENSED WAY BUT IN THE IN THE FULL THING ANYWAY
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK PROPORTION LIKE I EVEN THOUGH I'M I'M ALWAYS GETTING MYSELF CONFUSED ABOUT THIS BUT I THINK SORT OF MAKING THE SUMMARY LENGTH THING GENERALLY PROPORTION
LIKE AS A AS A PROPORTIONAL FACTOR OF OF ITS ORIGINAL LENGTH IS A GOOD WAY OF GOING ABOUT IT
BECAUSE ANYTHING WITH ABSOLUTE LENGTH'S SORT OF STUPID BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT A LONG LONG SEGMENT GETS TO ONE PERCENT OF ITS LENGTH AND ANOTHER ONE GETS TO EXACTLY THE SAME LENGTH AND STUFF
SO IF WE'RE DOING IT BY A PROPORTION THEN JUST HAVING ONE POINT ZERO OR SOMETHING MAKES IT VERY EASY TO ALWAYS END UP AT THE ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT I'VE CURRENTLY LIKE THE CURRENT CODE JUST TAKES A TENTH OF THE SUMMARY LENGTH
SO YEAH
AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF SLIDER THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LEAVE IN AND LIKE SHOW 'CAUSE THAT'S THAT'S FUNCTIONALITY
YEAH THAT'S SORT OF LIKE YOUR LEVEL OF THE ZOOM
OF IMPENDING DOOM
SHALL WE QUIT HERE
ANYTHING TO BE DISCUSSED
'CAUSE I'M GONNA COPY THAT STUFF OVER
YEAH OTHERWISE YOU'LL YOU'LL DEFINITELY SEE ME IN M. S. N.
SO I'LL JUST
IT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM FOR ME AT THE STAGE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I BASED EVERYTHING ON NOT HAVING THOSE UM
YEAH
UH WHAT I ALSO
YEAH WHAT I ALSO DID WAS HAVING TWO PEOPLE UM ANNOTATE THE FIRST MEETING
AND SO THEY DIDN'T ANNOTATE THE N N UH UH THE SPACES AND EVERYTHING WOULD MESS UP
I THINK IF I HAD SPACES FOR THE UM NEW VALUES SO WHEN I WENT TO DO CORRELATION IT WOULDN'T WORK ANYMORE
SO I DON'T KNOW
OH WHAT I COULD DO IS UM WORK UM FURTHER WITH UM WHAT I'VE GOT NOW AND THEN JUST WHEN I HAVE MY UM UM YEAH
THE FINAL FORMULA READY I COULD UH T APPLY TO THE NEW STUFF
THAT WOULD BE OKAY
UM
NO MY UM YEAH WHAT MY UM T. F. I. D. F. IS BASED ON COLIN'S DATA
SO
UM I END UP WITH THE SAME
YEAH
IS IT STILL THE OLD OLD T. F. I. D. F.
OH OKAY
HMM
YEAH
I THINK SO TOO
HOW ABOUT THE SUMMARISATION AGAIN YOU WANTED TO BASE IT ON SENTENCE LENGTH AS WELL
AND I'VE GOT A SENTENCE LENGTH INCORPORATED INTO MY IMPORTANCE MEASURE AT THE MOMENT
SO
OKAY
BUT IF WE DO IT TWICE IT WOULDN'T MAKE TOO MUCH SENSE
DON'T KNOW HOW EXACTLY WE WILL WANT TO IMPLEMENT YOUR
WE CAN
ARE WE STILL WITH THAT IDEA THAT WE WANT TO DISPLAY BARS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SPEAKERS
OKAY
AND ALSO DISPLAYING THE SPEAKERS BEFORE AN UTTERANCE
OKAY
SO TOBY YOU WANTED TO UH HAVE KEYWORDS FOR EACH TOPIC SEGMENT OR SOMETHING
UM WHO WOULD UH WHO UH PROVIDES THE VALUES FOR THAT
NO ONE
RIGHT
BECAUSE WHAT I DO IS UM HAVING UM VALUES FOR EACH SEGMENT AT THE MOMENT
SO I COULD JUST EXTRACT THE HIGHEST ONES FOR EACH SEGMENT
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOOD OR BAD
IT COULD BE AT LEAST I COULD PROVIDE SOME VALUE
UH IT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
I COULD DO BOTH
OKAY
MM
MM
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SEGMENTS ARE REALLY LONG
MM
AT LEAST THEIR NAMES AND IF WE HAVE THEIR NAMES THEN WE CAN GET THEIR EMAIL
MM
SIXTEEN TIMES ZERO
DOES IT
I HAVE TO CHECK THAT OUT
HMM
IT DEPENDS WHICH DATA YOU USE AS WELL BECAUSE UM IF YOU USE THE DATA WHERE THEY'RE ALL REALLY HIGH
IT DOES PREFER ONES FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE IT JUST PICKS THE FIRST ONES IT FINDS
BUT I'LL CHECK IT OUT ANYWAY
YEAH
I'VE GOT TIME NOW
LIKE UM FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS I'LL DO SOME ON IT 'CAUSE I WAS JUST TOO BUSY LAST WEEK
WHAT'S THAT THAT'S CREEPING OVER THE OTHER SCREEN
THAT'S REALLY WEIRD 'CAUSE IT'S JUST STARTED CREEPING OVER
UM WELL AS LONG AS THE TWO CORRESPOND THEN IT'S FINE
OH RIGHT I SEE
OKAY
SO WOULD IT BE WOULD IT BE EASIER IF THERE'S A REFERENCE FILE WITH THE ACTUAL REAL I. D. AND THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER
SO
IS THERE SOME ALREADY
SO WOULD THAT SOLVE THE PROBLEM BASICALLY
BECAUSE THE WHOLE PROGRAMME WORKS ON THEM BEING NUMBERED AT THE MOMENT
UM IT'D BE A LOT OF WORD FOR REALLY NO EXTRA P FEATURE GAIN AT ALL
OR DO YOU THINK IT COULD APPEAR IN THE SUMMARY
WELL IF IT'S SOMETHING IN THE AUDIO THAT'S JUST LIKE A NOISE THEN WE DON'T WANT IT
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T I DON'T KNOW
YOU 'CAUSE THE THING IS IT DEPENDS IF WE WANT TO HAVE IT DISPLAY THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE
IF YOU LEFT THEM IN HOPEFULLY IT WOULDN'T AFFECT THE WAY THE PROGRAMME WORKS
WELL I DON'T IN THE PROGRAMME IT'S JUST THEY'RE NOT IN THE RAW TEXT FILES
WELL EITHER WAY
EITHER WAY IS FINE BY ME AS LONG AS THE TWO WO THINGS UM TIE UP
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER THOSE ARE IN OR OUT
NO MINUS ONE OR SOMETHING
YEAH CERTAINLY POSSIBLE
ACTUALLY YEAH 'CAUSE THE T. F. I. D. F. WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WITH
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST OMIT THEM THEN
OKAY SO MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE THEM OUT THEN
OH IT'S THE BAR IS WORKING NOW
OH SO THE SUMMARY IS PROBABLY OKAY 'CAUSE IT DOES THE JOB
YEAH
OH I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE IT IS AT THE MOMENT
YEP THAT THAT THOSE NAMES ARE MISLEAD WELL THE T. F. I. D. F. IS FINE BUT WORD IMPORTANCE IS COMPLETELY MISLEADING IT'S NOT WORD IMPORTANCE AT ALL
IS IT VERY COMPLEX OR IS IT R OH JUST MULTIPLYING TOGETHER
TO A POWER
YEAH
I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE
YEAH
YEAH I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE ACTUALLY
YEAH
AH IT'S STILL WORKING LIKE IT SHOULD DO
YEAH
SO IT DID WORK
YEAH THAT THAT IS ANCIENT DATA THOUGH
SO
HAVING SAID THAT IT'S PICKING OUT SOME INTERESTING STUFF
LIKE WE'RE LOOKING AT ATLAS YOU'D EXPECT TO SCORE QUITE HIGH
YEAH MAYBE BUT ATLAS YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT IT'D BE QUITE HIGH
I'M JUST QUITE SURPRISED IT ALL ACTUALLY WORKED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING IT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON LIKE INCOMPLETE VERSIONS THAT HAVEN'T WORKED FOR A LONG TIME
AND LIKE TO SEE IT ALL COME TOGETHER
YEAH I'LL DO THE FIRST THING I'LL DO IS MAKE A LOAD BOX FOR SELECTING A FILE
AND A SCRIPT THAT SETS THE CLASS PATH SO IT CAN BE RUN WITH JUST A SCRIPT
SO P CLASS PATH IS LIKE THIS LONG
BUT WE'LL HAVE PARAMETER FOR THAT
YEAH
AND TWENTY
YEAH WE NEED TO ADD SOME SANITY CHECKING IN SOME OF THE STUFF
YEAH
BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T NEED IT EVALUATED FOR THE PRESENTATION DO WE
IS IT
OH 'CAUSE IT WAS MOVED BACK WASN'T IT
YEAH
I CAN ROPE PEOPLE IN TO TO DOING IT A FEW PEOPLE AT LEAST
AS LONG AS WE DESIGN IT AS LONG AS WE DESIGN IT BEFORE HAND UH I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY MANAGE TO ACTUALLY DO IT IN THE THREE DAYS AFTER
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE USER EVALUATION
WE SHOULD PROBABLY WRITE SOME USER DOCUMENTATION 'CAUSE I BET THAT WILL GET US MARKS
YEAH THEY'D LOVE THAT KIND OF STUFF
JUST WE'LL JUST WRITE YOU KNOW LITTLE HELP FILES OR SOMETHING
YEAH
HAVE YOU JAVA DOC ED IT
AND ALSO WHERE IS IT
OKAY 'CAUSE THE CODE VERSION IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY IS NOT THE RIGHT ONE
YEAH
OKAY
IN DIRECTORY YEAH
OKAY
WELL WE SHOULD WAIT TILL WE HAVE IT READY FOR UM YOU GUYS TO USE
THEN WE'LL PUT IT BACK IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY
SO I'LL TRY AND DO THAT TODAY
'CAUSE I'VE GOT TIME TODAY
AND AS LONG AS I DON'T RUN INTO PROBLEMS I DON'T SEE IT TAKING TOO LONG
WELL IN THAT CASE IT IT'S PROBABLY JUST I MEAN THAT'S PROBABLY FINE
I MEAN
YEAH
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH SHOULD BE DONE IN THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE UH
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE DONE OFF LINE
THE BASIC UH COMBINING OF ALL THE FACTORS
YEAH YEAH SURE
HOPEFULLY WE CAN TAKE OVER THAT RIGHT ONE 'CAUSE WE DON'T NEED IT
THAT'D BE QUITE NICE
I BET YOU CAN JUST UH JUST ADD IT TO THE UM PANEL
LIKE WHAT I BET THAT'S A PRE MADE SWING COMPONENT THAT LITTLE SLIDER AND ALL YOU DO IS ADD IT TO A PANEL
YEAH
CAN YOU SEND ME A LINK TO THAT PAPER SO THAT I'LL IMPLEMENT THAT IN SUMMARIZER
OH NO I'VE NOT LOOKED AT IT
YEAH LIKE LAST WEEK I JUST NOT DONE ANYTHING
BUT CAN'T SEE IT TAKING LONG AGAIN
BUT TO BE HONEST I DID LIKE NOTHING REALLY ON IT LAST WEEK
SO AND I'VE GOT TIME TODAY TOMORROW AND PROBABLY FRIDAY
SO
MM-HMM
IT'S JUST ANNOYING BECAUSE I NEED TO DO THAT ON A DICE MACHINE
SO I CAN'T GET THEM TO COMPILE UNDER WINDOWS
YEAH
AND UM MOST THE DICE MACHINES DON'T HAVE WORKING SOUND CARDS
SO
NO IDEA
YEAH
I'M NOT SURE HOW IT IF IT IF IT CAN DO SOUND OR NOT
I'VE NO IDEA
BUT LIKE WHAT I CAN DO IS UM
I I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT IT'LL JUST BE WRITING A SCRIPT AND IT WILL JUST GO
AND AS LONG AS I CAN TEST THE SCRIPT LIKE ONCE AND IT'S WORKING FINE I CAN JUST MAKE IT RETURN DUMMY STUFF SO IT WORKS ON OTHER MACHINES
YES
SO
OH ACTUALLY I KNOW WHAT I CAN DO
I CAN THEN
I CAN CHANGE THE SCRIPT
SO IF I'M USING MY ONE AT HOME
I CAN JUST ADD S. S. H. STUFF IN TO EV EVOKE THE SOUND TOOLS ON THE UH ON DICE AND THEN COPY 'EM BACK
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
I'M SURE I CAN FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO DO IT ANYWAY
IF IT COMES TO IT I'LL JUST UM INSTALL NETBEANS AND STUFF ON MY LINUX MACHINE AND WORK ON THAT
WELL THAT TO BE HONEST THERE WON'T BE A PRIMITIVE IN BETWEEN STAGE
JUST IT'LL JUST WORK HOPEFULLY
IN THEORY AT LEAST ANYWAY
I WONDER IF WE SHOULD UM DO SOMETHING LIKE DROPPING THE BOTTOM THIRD
THEN RE MAPPING THE LOWEST REMAINING ONE TO ZERO AND SCALING IT LIKE THAT 'CAUSE YOU GET A MUCH NICER DISTRIBUTION LIKE THAT
UM I'VE NOT USED IT TO DO THAT BEFORE BUT
YEAH
THERE IS A WAY OF CALCULATING IT UM YEAH WELL CALCULATING IT CUMULATIVELY BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER IT
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY QUITE A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY QUITE SENSIBLE
YEAH I CAN'T REMEMBER IT OFF HAND BUT I KNOW THERE IS ONE
BUT IT COULD BE IT COULD BE FINE I MEAN RUNNING OVER THE DATA TWICE PROBABLY IS OKAY
YEAH
MM
YEAH NEVER CLOSES THE PROCESS WHEN HE DOES IT NOW
THEY USED TO NOT UM CLOSE THE PROCESS WHEN YOU CLICK THE CROSS
YEAH IT REFUSES TO R LOAD THE CLOCK FOR SOME REASON
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YEAH YOU STILL YOU ST YEAH YOU STILL GET THE WRITTEN ONE AND THE DISPLAY
THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T GET IS THE CLOCK
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BOTHER 'CAUSE WE'LL RUN IT ON A SOUND CARD VERSION
TH YES THEY CAN
ALL THAT HAPPENS IS IT REFUSES TO LOAD LOAD THE CLOCK
YOU STILL GET THE DISPLAY IN THE SUMMARY
SO THE YEAH THE MOVE UH BUT YOU CAN STILL CLICK ON THE SEGMENTS AND THAT'LL STILL WORK WON'T IT
OKAY
YEAH
UM OH THERE MUST BE A WAY OF DETECTING WHETHER THE CLOCK'S LOADED
LIKE IN FACT THERE THERE IS
YOU CAN TRY AND SET SOMETHING ON THE CLOCK AND USE TRY AND CATCH AND THEN IF YOU CATCH THE EXCEPTIONS SET THE FLAG
WE COULD PUT THOSE ON DISPLAY
INSTEAD OF A LIST WHAT ABOUT PUTTING IT IN THE DISPLAY
CAN YOU CLICK ON A POINT IN TIME IN DISPLAY AND JUMP TO THERE YET
OKAY
'CAUSE THAT'D BE PRETTY GOOD
NO I DON'T GET THAT ON MY MACHINE
NO I DON'T
NO
OKAY
AS LONG AS YOU CAN SKIP MORE ACCURATELY THAN THE TIME STEPS THAT'S FINE
'CAUSE OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT RISK CUTTING BITS OFF
LIKE IF YOU WANT TO JUMP TO A POINT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO JUMP MORE ACCURATELY THAN HALF SECOND
BY HALF SECOND YOU'LL MISS WORDS
YEAH I THINK SO
OH YEAH I CAN YEAH I CAN DO THAT
OF WHAT WE DISPLAY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OBVIOUSLY WE'LL HIDE THAT IN THE PRESENTATION
BUT WE DON'T WANT I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO HAVE EXPOSED TO THE USER DOING THINGS LIKE ADDING THE THRESHOLD OF WHICH AGREEMENTS WE DISPLAY
DECISION
YEAH THEY UH THAT DOES LOOK QUITE PROMISING DOESN'T IT
SO YOU CAN HAVE HAPPY FACES AND ANGRY FACES
YEAH YEAH
THAT MAKES SENSE
SO CAN YOU UM
SO WILL THAT PRODUCE BASICALLY AN AGREEMENT AND A DISAGREEMENT SCORE FOR EVERY DIALOGUE ACT
SO COULD YOU PUT THEM IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THE OTHER DATA
AND I'LL MAKE US T TO READ IT IN
OH RIGHT OKAY
SO I COULD PROBABLY I COULD PROBABLY READ IT FROM UH THAT FILE ALREADY
MY PREFERRED WOULD BE DIALOGUE ACT NUMBER THEN YOU CAN PUT BOTH THE SCORES IN ONE FILE
YOU CAN PUT BOTH THE SCORES IN ONE FILE IF IT MAKES IT EASIER
YEAH
AGREEMENT AND ONE DISAGREEMENT
SO I'LL READ THAT INTO UM I'LL MAKE IT PART OF THE GET MEASURE THING
SO YOU CAN JUST GET IT WITH A FLAG
USING GET MEASURE
SO YOU KNOW HOW ZERO IS T. F. I. D. F.
ONE IS UM THE WELL I'VE CALLED IT WORD IMPORTANCE BUT THAT'S A REALLY M MISLEADING NAME
YEAH PROBABLY
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY
UH THE PROBLEM IS YEAH IS OCCURRING NOT ONLY AS AN AGREEMENT BUT REALLY FREQUENTLY AS LIKE UH AN ENCOURAGEMENT AS WELL ISN'T IT
YEAH
HOW WHAT'S THE HIGHEST UM RANKED ONE THAT THAT KIND OF PROBLEM OCCURS WITH
'CAUSE IF IT'S BELOW ABOUT 'CAUSE I SAW THERE'S ONES UP IN THE EIGHTIES WASN'T THERE
IF IT'S BELOW LIKE FIFTY IT'S PROBABLY OR EXACTLY NO THEY'RE ALL BUT ONE
'CAUSE WE ON THE DISPLAY WE PROBABLY TAKE QUITE HIGH
SO IT'D ONLY MATTER IF IT OCCURS ON ONES THAT ARE REALLY HIGHLY RANKED
YEAH
WELL OTHERWISE YOU'D GET ICONS ALL OVER THE PLACE
SO ANYWAY
YEAH
SO WE WANT PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE A THRESHOLD AT LEAST OF FIFTY OR SIXTY JUST AS A LOOKING AT THAT
TO WE PROBABLY WON'T WANT TO DISPLAY NINETY
WE'D WANT TO RATE THEM AS HOW IMPORTANT THEY WERE WOULDN'T WE
YEAH
YEAH AND SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT
AN AGREEMENT AT THE END
SO YEAH WE'D PROBABLY WANT TO MERGE ONES THAT WERE VERY CLOSE INTO ONE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE SOME LOGIC WHEN IT DISPLAYS IT THAT SAYS IF THERE'S ONES VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IT JUST CENTRES IT AMONG THE
YEAH IT'S LOOKING QUITE GOOD THOUGH
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS REALLY FUNNY THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS WHO DON'T USE THE COMPUTER MUCH
THEIR DESKTOP'S REALLY TIDY AND WHEN YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO USE IT ALL THE TIME THERE'S STUFF EVERYWHERE
SO MINE'S LIKE THAT AS WELL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE WE SHOULD UM DOWNLOAD A DICTIONARY AND CHECK OUR UTTERANCES BEFORE WE UH LISTEN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY REAL WORDS
DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
YEAH I MEAN SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT
IF THEY LOOK GOOD THEN THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT AS ANY I SUPPOSE
ACTUALLY WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IS TAKE THE HIGHEST THREE OR FOUR AND THEN JUST MERGE THEM TOGETHER INTO ONE UTTERANCE
IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT IT'D GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
YEAH I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TIME FOR THAT
WHICH IS A SHAME 'CAUSE IT WOULD'VE BEEN COOL
UM AT THE MOMENT IT DOESN'T REALLY CARE HOW MANY MEETINGS IT'S DISPLAYING
JUST DRAW A BIG BLACK LINE ON THE BORDERS I THINK
WELL Y YOU YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO
IT'S
'CAUSE IT JU IT CAN DISPLAY FROM ANY UTTERANCE TO ANY OTHER UTTERANCE
IT DOESN'T REALLY
DO THEY
AH
YEAH I'D PREFER THEM DRAWN CONTINUOUSLY
OKAY
BECAUSE THAT WAY ALL WE HAVE TO DO TO DISPLAY EA MORE THAN ONE MEETING IS HAVE A HARDER BOUNDARY DRAWN
ONE THING WE WILL HAVE TO DO IS WE WANT WE'D REALLY WANT A DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR IF WE CLICKED ON A WHOLE MEETING THAN A SEGMENT
SO IF THERE'S MORE THAN ONE MEETING DISPLAYED
IT SHOULD UM IF YOU CLICK EVEN ON ONE THE SEGMENTS OF THAT MEETING I THINK IT SHOULD RE INITIALIZE AND DISPLAY THAT JUST THAT MEETING
SO I'M NOT SU I'M NOT SURE HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE TO DO
IT JUST NEEDS TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S DISPLAYING MORE THAN ONE WHOLE MEETING DOESN'T IT
THAT'S THE ONLY
KNOWLEDGE IT WOULD NEED
BUT ANYWAY WE CAN SORT THAT OUT IF WE HAVE TIME ONCE WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING ELSE
YEAH
THAT'LL GET S S SUFFICIENT TO CLAIM THAT WE HAD IMPLEMENTED SOME KIND OF ZOOM AS WELL
YEAH
YEAH IT'S NOT DONE THE VERY CLEVER WAY BUT IT DOES WORK
MM-HMM
BASICALLY DO A CODE FOR EASE ON IT
UM I'LL PROBABLY TONIGHT JUST WORK ON GETTING A FROZEN VERSION THAT WORKS CONSISTENTLY
AND UM IF YOU COULD DOCUMENT IT FOR ME THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH FOR ME TO ADD IT IN
UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO IT
BUT MY CODE I'VE NOT DOCUMENTED THE PROGRAMME MANAGER CLASS
SO THOUGH IT'S A BIT HAIRY AT THE MOMENT ISN'T IT
UH-HUH
OKAY SO PROBABLY WHAT YOU'D WANT TO DO IS UM
DETECT WHERE THE MOUSE IS AND CHANGE THE DEFAULT TOOL TIP FOR THAT COMPONENT
BECAUSE IT AUTOMATICALLY DISPLAYS AT THE CORRECT POSITION WHEN YOU HOVER
YEAH YOU MIGHT NOR REALLY WANT TO BE CREATING A NEW ONE EVERY TIME YOU MOVE THE MOUSE
I'LL HAVE A LOOK THROUGH SOME OF MY JAVA BOOKS 'CAUSE IT MIGHT BE THE SORT OF THING THEY HAVE IN THERE
MM
IS THERE ALL IS THAT G VERSION ALL IN THE
OKAY
COOL
SO I'LL START WORKING ON THAT IN LIKE HALF AN HOUR OR SOMETHING AND IT WILL BE THE
OKAY
WE REALLY NEED TO GET IN CONTACT WITH THE OTHER GROUP AND SEE IF THEY WANT TO DO A JOINT EVALUATION
SO YOU NEED TO GET THEIR EMAIL ADDRESSES
ARE THEY
THAT'D BE HANDY
YEAH WE CAN GET THEM
SO YOU DO IS SENDING THEM AN EMAIL
'CAUSE I WAS HOPING THAT STEVE WOULD MENTION IT IAN 'CAUSE WE'VE MENTIONED IT TO HIM SO MANY TIMES
BUT HE OBVIOUSLY HASN'T
YEAH
S THERE'S THE FRAME PROBLEM
NO I THINK IT'S COMING TOGETHER NOT BAD AT THE MOMENT ACTUALLY
DON'T KNOW
YEAH
I CAN'T SEE IT GOING ON FOR AN HOUR TO BE HONEST
YEAH I THOUGHT IT WAS A DEMO BASICALLY
HALF AN HOUR
AND LIKE TEN MINUTES OF THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY SET UP TIME AS WELL
TEN MINUTES OF THAT WILL PROBABLY BE SET UP TIME AS WELL
I WE MAYBE YOU SHOULD PRESENT IT ON YOUR LAPTOP 'CAUSE WE CAN BE REALLY SURE IT'S RUNNING BEFORE WE COME
I COULD PROBABLY GET MY COMPUTER IN IF I COULD GET SOMEONE TO GIVE ME A LIFT
I KNOW A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WITH CARS
YEAH 'CAUSE I WOULDN'T NEED TO BRING A MONITOR OR ANYTHING I'LL JUST NEED TO BRING THE BOX
I'M PRETTY SURE I COULD NICK A LIFT OFF SOMEONE
OR J. BUILDER
IN FACT YOU WON'T EVEN YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN NEED EITHER AS LONG AS YOU GOT JAVA INSTALLED
YEAH
OH CRAP I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
CYGWIN MAYBE
IN CYGWIN
NO BUT CYGWIN SHOULD RUN UM THE JAVA AS WELL
A SOUND SERVER
HOPEFULLY YEAH
YEP I'LL DO THAT TODAY
AND I'LL YEAH I'LL MAKE A SCRIPT TO RUN IT AND PUT THAT IN THE GROUP DIRECTORY
AND I'LL SEND AROUND THE EMAIL WHEN IT'S DONE
IT'LL BE THE BIT WHERE IT CREATES THE CLOCK
OR IS THERE STUFF IN THE DISPLAY AS WELL
OKAY
WELL IT REALLY WE SHOULDN'T EVEN NEED A FLAG
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH EXCEPTIONS
I MEAN THAT'S THIS IS KINDA NOT EXACT CASE THAT EXCEPTIONS ARE MADE FOR REALLY
YEAH
MM-HMM
OH NO IT'S GONNA HAVE TO DO SOMETHING A BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
WHAT IT WILL HAVE TO DO IS DE REGISTER EVERYTHING AS TIME HANDLERS AND THEN UPDATE AND THEN RE REGISTER THEM
OKAY
HAVE YOU GOT A COMPONENT FOR DISPLAYING LISTS OF MATCHES
'CAUSE THAT'D BE PRETTY USEFUL
COOL
OKAY YEAH I MEAN IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TOO HARD TO DO
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DE REGISTER EVERYTHING THAT'S A TIME HANDLER FIRST BEFORE YOU ADD THE STUFF IN
BUT UM DEPENDS WHAT BEHAVIOUR WE WANT
DO WE WANT WHEN YOU CLICK ON A SEARCH RESULT WE DEFINITELY WANT THAT ONE TO APPEAR IN THE SUMMARY
YEAH
YEAH IT SETS IF YOU LOOK AT SET SELECT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU WANNA DO YEAH
DOES IT NOT
YEAH BUT IT W IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE UM IF IT'S JUMPED TO IN THE END TEXT AREA
THEN YOUR DISPLAY WOULD THE THE LINE'LL JUMP WON'T IT
YEAH
UH AND ALSO THE REAL TIME AND PLAY TIME STUFF WOULD CHANGE
SO WE YEAH WE NEED TO RE INITIALIZE THE DISPLAY THEN DON'T WE
OKAY
BUT YEAH WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO ENSURE THAT THE SEARCH RESULT IS IN THE SUMMARY THAT'S CREATED
SO MAY WE PROBABLY WANT A DIFFERENT SUMMARY CONSTRUCTOR THAT TAKES AN AN ADDITIONAL ARGUMENT OF AN I. D.
AND IT WILL THAT W UTTERANCE WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE SUMMARY
YEAH I SUPPOSE
BUT THE TROUBLE IS THAT STILL DOESN'T GUARANTEE THAT IT'LL APPEAR BECAUSE IF YOU GET ENOUGH OF THEM THAT ARE HIGH SCORED IT PREFERS THE FIRST ONES IT SEES
YEAH I SUPPOSE
HMM MAYBE
BUT YOU COULD D YOU CAN UM ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT
YEAH
PROBABLY THE WAY TO HANDLE THAT WOULD BE TO MAKE A SUMMARY THAT'S THE SAME LENGTH AS THE SELECTION AND THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE SEARCH TERM CAME UP
YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
BUT WE'LL HAVE THAT SLIDER OBVIOUSLY
YEAH 'CAUSE THAT'S VERY USEFUL THING
YEAH
OKAY
AND I'LL START WORK IN SAY TWO
WILL IT BE DONE BY THEN
I KNOW
DOESN'T LOOK GREAT DOES IT
UH UH
MM
YEAH THERE IS THERE'S INDEX FILES ALREADY
YEAH
YEAH IN THE RAW TEXT INDEX DIRECTORY
YEAH AND IT UH ALLOWS YOU TO MAP BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT I. D. S
YEAH I GUESS
'CAUSE WE CAN'T SHOW IT IN THE DISPLAY
YEAH THEY'VE BEEN CUT OUT THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY WORDS
SUPPOSE
HUH
NO I GUESS NOT
HMM
THAT'S JUST 'CAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE A BLANK LINE IN IT
SEEMS A BIT STUPID
BUT I CAN FIT 'EM BACK IN IF
YEAH
YEAH IT'S A CER UH
YEAH MY TOPIC SEGMENTER DOESN'T LIKE BLANK LINES EITHER
MM
OH YEAH COOL
YEAH ANOTHER UH SH ISSUE WAS THAT
HMM
HMM
HMM
OH YEAH
HUH
HMM
HMM
YEAH
BUT YEAH
YEAH
SO YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GON
DO YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TIME
IS IT NOT IS IT NOT ONLY TWO DAYS ANYWAY
YEAH THAT'D PROBABLY BE QUITE GOOD
YEAH I'VE GOT A BASIC SEARCH WORKING NOW
IT'S G IT'S GOT A USER INTERFACE
SO YEAH
NO
UH I'M STILL IN MY DIRECTORY BUT I I CAN PUT IT IN YOUR DIRECTORY
YEAH YEAH I'VE I'VE NOT BEEN USING THAT
YEAH
YEAH I'VE JUST BEEN TAKING THE THE CLASS FILES FROM YOUR DIRECTORY
HMM
YEAH
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
NO ONE YET
YEAH THAT
THAT COULD BE GOOD YEAH
HMM
UH
HMM
YEAH ARE WE GONNA HAVE TIME TO MAKE IT DISPLAY LIKE A WHOLE ARCHIVE OF MEETINGS
OR IS IT JUST GONNA BE DISPLAYING SINGLE MEETINGS AND YOU'LL HOLD UP DIFFERENT ONES
HMM
YEAH THE SEE AT THE MOMENT THE DIALOGUE I. D. S JUST THEY START AT ZERO FOR EACH MEETING THEY DON'T RUN UM CONTINUOUSLY
BUT YOU W YOU'D LIKE THEM TO RUN CONTINUOUSLY
YEAH I CAN CHANGE THAT
YEAH JUST TO CHANGE THE INDEX FILES AS WELL
MM
DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT A SEARCH IN SOON
NO OH YEAH
YES
YEAH WELL WE'LL WORK ON IT YEAH
HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
HMM
YES WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE EVALUATION NEXT WEEK
YEAH WE COULD DO THAT
YEAH I THINK THEY'RE ON THE N. L. S. S. D. WEB PAGE
HMM
YEAH
YEAH PROBABLY AS LONG AS WE NEED
BUT YEAH I DON'T KNOW
HALF AN HOUR OR SOME
YEAH HALF AN HOUR PROBABLY
HMM
YEAH I THINK
YEAH
HMM
YEAH IT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA TO DO THAT
COULD WE GUARANTEE THAT IT'D WORK
HMM
YEAH I'VE BEEN ABLE TO RUN IT WITHOUT YEAH
HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I'M SURE HE'LL LET US UH TEST IT OUT BEFORE WE DO IT
YEAH DAVE SEE IN THE PROGRAMME MANAGER DO YOU HAVE A A METHOD TO LIKE SET THE CURRENT I. D. SO IT'LL UPDATE THE DISPLAY
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA NEED WHEN I'M UH LIKE GETTING SEARCH RESULTS
HMM
RIGHT
YEAH WELL AS FAR AS I'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT I'VE MADE A RESULTS CLASS THAT'S GOT LIKE THE I. D. AND THE STUFF
YEAH
YEP
I'M WELL I'M WORKING ON IT
RIGHT
I YEAH AND IT MIGHT NOT BE THERE
I KNOW I WAS THINKING THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM
HMM
HMM
YEAH
W YOU COULD YOU COULD WHEN IT'S WHEN YOU'RE DOING A SEARCH
YOU COULD JUST LIKE SORT OF ZOOM BACK OUT SO YOU GOT THE FULL TEXT FOR THAT SEGMENT OR THAT MEETING RATHER THAN A SUMMARY
'CAUSE THAT'S MAYBE WHAT YOU'D WANT IF YOU WERE A USER
YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT OPTION
HMM
MM
HMM
ALRIGHT
YEAH
CAN YOU JUST REMIND ME I DON'T HAVE TO TICK THE NO N OKAY THING UNTIL I FINISH WRITING
BUT IT'S ONLY IF I GO BACK TO IT I TICK OKAY AGAIN
MM
YEP
SO IF I'M WORKING O IF I'VE DONE A PAGE I'M ON THE SECOND PAGE
I TICK IT SO UM I FINISH THAT PAGE AND I GO BACK TO THIS I CAN JUST WRITE AND THEN NOT TICK UNTIL I FINISH WRITING AGAIN
YEAH SO IT'S ALWAYS AFTER N YOU NEVER HAVE TO IT BEFORE
FINE
FINE
AND YOU CAN GO ON BOTH SIDES AS WELL
OKAY
WELL I THINK THE FIRST THING IS
WELL THE FIRST THING I THINK IS WE NEED TO UH SORT OUT THE CALL FOR ABSTRACTS OR THE C THE CALL FOR TITLES
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S KIND OF OVERDUE
YEAH
UM SO I VOLUNTEER TO DO THAT IF YOU LIKE
UM UH OKAY
SO
AND I'LL DO THAT
BY TRYING TO THINK WHAT IS IT THURSDAY TODAY I'LL D I'LL DO THAT BY THE END OF THE WEEK ANYWAY
SO
YEAH WE'RE GONNA DO THAT BUT I THINK WE SHOULD S PROBABLY SEND OUT UM SEPARATE CALLS OKAY
SO WE'LL SEND ONE BUT WEREN'T MEN I MEAN WE COULD MENTION THE FACT THAT WE'RE INVITING OTHER PEOPLE
BUT I THINK IT WILL PROBABLY JUST UH I MEAN IT PROBABLY WON'T MATTER TOO MUCH TO THE OTHER LINGUISTS THAT WE'RE HAVING OTHER PEOPLE THERE
WE CAN MENTION IT BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE TOO ESSENTIAL AND UH WE MIGHT ACTUALLY JUST END UP MAKING THEM WORRY THAT
YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR PLACE OR WHATEVER BECAUSE UH I DON'T KNOW
BUT WE DO WE DO HAVE TO DECIDE A PRIORITY THING SO THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN LOOK AT UM A LITTLE BIT
LATER DOWN THE LINE
SO SO THAT'S THE ONE FOR LING BASICALLY AND I'LL SEND THAT OUT
I'LL DO THAT TODAY OR TOMORROW
UM NOW CLAIRE THAT'S THE OTHER THING SHE CAN DEAL WITH THE PSYCHOLOGY
UM
PSYCHOLOGY PEOPLE PROBABLY THAT'S I RECKON IT'S THE BEST THING TO DO
'CAUSE SHE'LL KNOW WHICH EMAIL ADDRESS TO USE AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE
SO UM
IF ONE OF US COULD EMAIL CLAIRE
OKAY YEAH SO IF ROBERT
SO I IF ROBERT EMAILS CLAIRE AND WE'RE N GONNA NEED TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S GONNA SAY ON THERE
UM
WE MIGHT NEED TO JUST REMIND HER OF THE DATES IN CASE SHE DOESN'T KNOW SO SHE GETS THE DATES RIGHT
UM
AND UH UM SHE'S I KNOW SHE ALREADY KNOWS THAT IT'S JUST ANYONE DOING PSYCHO LINGUISTICS BASICALLY
SO THAT'S FINE
YEAH EXACTLY
EXACTLY
UM
BUT THEN THERE'S THE REST OF P. P. L. S. AND I THINK WE NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER
I THINK SHE SHOULD JUST I THINK SHE SHOULD JUST WRITE HER OWN
PROBABLY
AND
OKAY
SO WHAT WE'LL DO I MEAN THE THING IS THE THE MAIN CALL WILL GO OUT BEFORE SHE'S GOT ROUND TO IT ANYWAY
SO WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL COPY IT
I'LL C. C. HER ON THE UM
NO THEY WON'T BE
I JUST TH THE ONLY THING I'M THINKING IS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT STANDS OUT AS SOMETHING APPLICABLE TO THEM
THAT THEY DON'T GO OH WE'RE JUST GETTING RUBBISH FROM Y YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
I WANT THEM TO REALLY KNOW THAT IT'S ADDRESSED TO THEM
UM AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT CLAIRE SENDING IT IS SHE'S PROBABLY GOT A PSYCH EMAIL ADDRESS AS WELL AND IT IT MIGHT LOOK A BIT MORE RELEVANT TO THEM
YEAH EXACTLY
THEY KNOW HER ET CETERA
UM SO YEAH SO IF IF WE'VE S IF I'VE C. C. ED THE ORIGINAL ONE THEN YOU CAN TELL HER THAT THAT CAN BE THE BASIS FOR
UM THE BASIS FOR HER EMAIL BUT JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW IT'S RELEVANT TO THEM ET CETERA
UM AND OBVIOUSLY IN P. P. L. S. WE'VE ALSO GOT ENGLISH LANGUAGE
NOW
IN A WAY WE COULD SEND OUT THAT FIRST CALL TO THEM JUST AS PART OF THE SAME EMAIL
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO THINK IT WAS RELEVANT TO THEM
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
BUT UM I THINK WE DEFINITELY SHOULD OPEN IT UP TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE
UM I THINK PARTICULARLY AT THE MOMENT 'CAUSE THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO SORT OF UH MERGE US INTO ONE SUBJECT AREA
EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD BE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE WE'RE ALL PART OF A SCHOOL I THINK THAT IT DOES ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD INVITE THEM BUT THEN WE'VE STILL GOT THE PROBLEM OF UH A PRIORITY ISSUE
SO YOU KNOW PROBABLY WHAT I WAS THINKING IS UM CERTAINLY SECOND AND THIRD YEARS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE UH TOP ON TOP PRIORITY
BUT THEN THERE'S A KIND OF AWKWARD QUESTION OF WHERE WE PUT FIRST YEARS BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO
IF THEY WANT TO SHOULD THEY HAVE PRIORITY
THIS IS A KIND OF LOWER POINT BUT UH IT KIND OF IT CROSSES OVER WITH DECIDING
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WHEN WE UH
WELL
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
IT'S THREE DAYS
RIGHT
THE UH UH THEY WERE TWENTY TWENTY MINUTE TALKS WITH TEN MINUTE UH QUESTION TIME OKAY
AND YOU CAN RUN TWO IN A ROW BUT PROBABLY NOT UP TO THREE
TWO WHAT DO YOU THINK TWO IN A ROW OR THREE IN A ROW
MM-HMM
YEAH
I MEAN THE THING IS EVERY TIME WE HAVE A BREAK THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE ACTUALLY SERVE COFFEE AND BISCUITS AND THINGS
BECAUSE THAT'S THE KINDA NORMAL THING TO DO
SO ARE YOU SAYING HAVE SAY THREE SESSIONS IN A ROW AND THEN DO THAT TWICE IN THE MORNING AND TWICE IN THE AFTERNOON
SO THAT'D BE SIX HOURS
OH SO JUST HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF IN THE MORNING
'CAUSE I MEAN WOULD SIX HOURS A DAY BE PUSHING IT
NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE I MEAN THE GOOD THINK IS N
WELL I SUPPOSE WHAT WE CAN DO IS THINK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE NOW AND SAY RIGHT WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM WE CAN DO
SO I THINK THAT'S ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE COULD DO TO HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF THEN HAVE A COFFEE BREAK
THEN HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF THEN HAVE LUNCH HOUR AND A HALF COFFEE BREAK HOUR AND A HALF
AND SO THAT WOULD BE EIGHTEEN HOURS OF TALKS OVERALL WOULDN'T IT
BUT WHAT DO WE SAY
SO IT'S TH SO IT'S TWELVE THIRTY SIX TALKS IS THAT RIGHT
MAXIMUM THIRTY SIX
UM
OKAY LET'S JUST PUT THIS DOWN
UH
WELL I COULD LOOK 'CAUSE I I'VE GOT THAT THERE'S THE LIST ISN'T THERE OF POST GRADUATES I MAINTAIN IN IN LINGUISTICS
UM THERE ARE PROBABLY ABOUT THIRTY ON THERE
UM BUT A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM ARE FIRST YEARS AND I DON'T KNOW I MEAN JUST TO GET AN IDEA ARE YOU PLANNING ON TALKING
NO
ARE YOU PLANNING ROBERT
AND I'M PROBABLY NOT
SO THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT ALMOST NONE OF THE FIRST YEARS ARE GONNA VOLUNTEER
UM SO
IF WE HAD SAY TWENTY LINGUISTICS AND EVEN THEN
I MEAN THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE ABROAD AND WHO WON'T BOTHER TO TURN UP OR CAN'T MAKE IT OR WHATEVER
SO YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE THAT WE ONLY GET SAY FIFTEEN ANYWAY
AND THEN WE COULD BE LEFT WITH UH FIFTEEN BLOCKS FOR UM THE REST OF P. P. L. S.
SO AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THAT WE'VE GOT AN ABSOLUTE LIMIT OF ABOUT THIRTY SIX TALKS YEAH
UM
YEAH
OKAY
AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT UH THE COFFEE BREAKS WILL BE FOR AND MAYBE LUNCHTIMES
BUT COFFEE BREAKS ARE PROBABLY MORE LIKE AB OR ARE GONNA BE A BETTER TIME
BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL HANG AROUND WHEREAS PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO OFF SOMEWHERE FOR LUNCH AREN'T THEY
OKAY
MM
SO UH HOW LONG SHOULD A POSTER SESSION BE
LIKE HOW LONG WILL PEOPLE WANT TO MILL AROUND FOR LOOKING AT
OKAY
SO THAT MEANS WE COULD HAVE THIRTY TALKS
PLUS
UH ONE A. M. OR P. M. OF POSTERS
YEAH
AND WE COULD PROBABLY GET QUITE A FEW IN THERE AT LEAST SIX ANYWAY
AT LEAST SIX POSTERS IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
DURING THE SESSION LIKE HOW MANY CAN YOU HAVE GOING ON AT ONCE
WALL SPACE AND
FIRST YEARS
NO
I'VE BEEN TO DURHAM UH POST GRADUATE CONFERENCE AND I MEAN EVERY CONFERENCE I'VE EVER BEEN TO
THE POSTERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE COFFEE BREAK WHICH IS WHY PROBABLY BECAUSE NORMALLY THEY'RE LIMITED ON SPACE AND THEY
YEAH
WELL I THINK KEEPING IT
UM ALONG SIDE THE CONFERENCE IS POSSIBLY ONE WAY OF MAINTAINING INTEREST AND
AND UH
YEAH I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY THE IDEA I THINK THE BEST IDEA
I CAN IMAGINE IT WOULD SEEM A BIT RANDOM JUST HAVE LIKE A POSTER SESSION AND BES UH YEAH JUST HAVE A P A POSTER SESSION UM
WHAT WOULD IT BE AT THE BEGINNING
SO I SUPPOSE IT IS IT NORMALLY UH SECOND YEARS DO IT LIKE JUST AFTER THEY'VE COME BACK FOR THE S
THE
THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE I THINK
IT
YEAH BUT I D I DON'T THINK HE MEANS THAT IT WOULD BE
THE FIRST YEARS WHO'VE ONLY JUST ARRIVED WOULD DO A POSTER
THAT WOULD BE A BIT ODD WOULDN'T IT
OKAY SO AT LEAST ANYONE WHO'S FEELING YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH I I MIGHT DO I D I STILL TH I'M LITTLE BIT DOUBTFUL
BUT UM SO THAT'S GOOD ANYWAY
SO
WE'VE GOT AN IDEA
I THINK THERE'S THIRTY TALKS AND AND SAY SIX TEN POSTERS WHATEVER WE CAN MANAGE TO FIT IN THE ROOM
UM SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHERE WE'RE GONNA HO HOLD IT
WE COULD HAVE IT IN B. NINE BUT THERE'S THINGS ALL OVER THE WALL
THERE ARE THOSE PICTURES THAT RUN ALL THE WAY AROUND SO CAN WE TAKE THE PICTURES DOWN
CAN WE USE B. NINE FOR THE POSTERS FOR INSTANCE
OKAY SO POSTER BOARDS
AND WHA UH UM WHAT I'LL DO I'LL EMAIL MITS ABOUT THAT OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
WELL WHAT WE'LL DO IS SA WE CAN JUST SAY UH IF YOU WANT TO DO A TALK
THEN JUST SAY SO AND IF YOU WANT TO DO A POSTER THEN SAY YOU WANT TO DO A POSTER
AND WE CAN SORT OF BASE IT AROUND THAT
AND IF WE GET ABSOLUTELY TONS OF PEOPLE WANTING TO DO POSTERS AND WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A YOU KNOW
EVERYONE'S KIND OF DONE IT AS A COP OUT THEN WE MIGHT HAVE TO SORT OF SAY TO THEM WELL YOU KNOW
WOULD YOU CONSIDER DOING A TALK INSTEAD BECAUSE UH PARTICULARLY THE SECOND AND THIRD YEARS
BECAUSE WE NEED MORE TALKS AND JUST YOU KNOW DO IT LIKE THAT
UM WE COULD EVEN SAY SOMETHING LIKE UM YOU KNOW
FIRST YEARS MIGHT WANT TO GIVE A POSTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THAT'S A BAD IDEA BUT
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY SO WE GOT SOME SORT OF IDEA OF
THE STRUCTURE AND HOW MANY TALKS WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE
I MEAN W
YEAH
OKAY
SO I'VE UH OKAY SO ENGLISH LANGUAGE UM WE'LL PUT ON THE MAIN CALL
AND I'LL JUST I I'LL JUST KINDA MARKET IT AS AN LINGUISTICS AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK
YES AND INFORMATICS WE COULD THINK ABOUT IT AS WELL
SO I HAD A LOOK
AT WHETHER THEY DO PHILOSOPHY OF A LANGUAGE AND LOGIC AND STUFF HERE AND THEY KIND OF DO
THERE'S ABOUT THERE'S ABOUT THREE OR FOUR UH FULL TIME MEMBERS OF STAFF THAT LIST UM PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE AS A MAJOR INTEREST
SO CHANCES ARE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SOME P. H. D. STUDENTS THAT UH ARE INTERESTED
SO
DO WE THINK WE SHOULD INVITE THEM
I THINK I'D BE SURPRISED IF WE GOT SORT OF FOUR OUT OF THEM
I THINK THAT WOULD BE
AMAZING IF WE DID
SO I THINK IT'S PROBABLY WORTH I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA GET INUNDATED WITH REQUESTS
SO I THINK IT'S WORTH ASKING THEM
YEAH
I MEAN I THINK THE INFORMATICS ARE DEFINITELY WORTH ASKING
UH TH THERE'S THERE'S C. S. T. R. AND UM H. C. R. C.
YES
IT IS
YEAH IT IS
IT
YEAH WELL IT WOULD BE NICE TO THAT
IT WOULD BE NICE IT WOULD BE NICE TO DO IT
THE THING IS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BIAS IT TOWARDS ANY PARTICULAR KIND OF LINGUISTICS IN A SENSE
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR DEPARTMENT IS THEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SORT OF EMBRACE ALL KINDS
IN FACT EVEN BY INVITING UM PEOPLE FROM UM INFORMATICS AND FROM OR MAYBE FROM PHILOSOPHY AND THINGS IT MIGHT BIAS IT IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION
BUT I DON'T KNOW IT'S PROBABLY NOT TOO BAD
I I THINK THAT I THINK THAT BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY INFORMATICS AND UM PSYCHOLOGY YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT QUITE A LOT OF BREADTH THERE ANYWAY
UM THE THING IS
UH THE ONE THING IS THE ONLY KIND OF PEOPLE DOING ANYTHING LIKE APPLIED LINGUISTICS ARE THE APPLIED LINGUISTS THEMSELVES AND PEOPLE IN SOCIOLOGY WITH AN INTEREST IN LANGUAGE
AND I DON'T THINK WE'D BE INVITING THEM
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE THE FIRST THING IS THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR INVITING EVERYONE IN P. P. L. S. BECAUSE WE ARE IN ONE SCHOOL
AND THEN THE FACT THAT WE ALSO INVITE PEOPLE FROM THE INFORMATICS I SUPPOSE IT'S JUST THAT WE DO HAVE PRETTY STRONG TIES WITH THEM
AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD BE TOO OFFENDED
I HOPE NOT ANYWAY
UM
SO YEAH
SO WHAT KIND OF PROVISOR CAN WE PUT ON
I MEAN WE COULD
WE COULD JUST SAY OUTRIGHT ANYONE IN THEIR THIRD YEAR OR ANYONE IN THEIR SECOND OR THIRD YEAR
BUT I DON'T KNOW
OR WE CAN JUST YOU KNOW T UH TAKE WHATEVER WE GET AND PICK THE BEST BETWEEN US WHICH IS
Y YEAH
YEAH
SO
SO YOU'RE GOING TO EMAIL CLAIRE
UM
SO WHO WANTS TO SEND SOMETHING OUT TO INFORMATICS
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH SURE
UM SO
YEAH SO WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY IS ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GIVE A TALK ON LOGIC OR PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
UM BUT PUT A WARNING THAT IF IT'S LOGIC THEN THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND OR NOT THAT MANY
I MEAN MAYBE JUST MAYBE IF YOU JUST PUT
YEAH JUST PUT PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY GOOD
OR JUST OR ANY PH
YEP
YEAH THAT'S IT
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
YEAH THAT I THINK THAT'S AS MUCH AS WE NEED TO SAY
THAT'S RIGHT
SO UH YOU'VE GOTTA WORK OUT HOW TO DO THAT AND WHO TO EMAIL
MM
YEAH THAT'S FINE THAT'S FINE
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANNA DO
UM AS LONG AS IT'S CLEAR FROM THE SUBJECT BAR THAT IT'S RELEVANT TO THEM AND THAT IT SAYS SOMEWHERE THAT
FOR PHILOSOPHY STUDENTS WITH AN INTEREST IN LANGUAGE AND AND THAT'S IT
AND THEN BETWEEN US WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER MEETING AND AND I MEAN AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE SORTING THROUGH ALL THE OTHER TITLES AND AND DECIDING UM HOW TO DIVIDE UP THE SESSIONS
SEE SOMEONE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER TO HAVE TALKS ON A SIMILAR TOPIC SPREAD OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHICH TO ME JUST SEEMED ABSOLUTELY CRAZY
AND THE REASON SHE GAVE ME WAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH UH TAKING OUT LIKE A WHOLE DAY OR A WHOLE AFTERNOON WOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT
BUT I THINK THAT BALANCE AGAINST THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL LOOK I CAN HAVE JUST THIS ONE DAY OFF
AS OPPOSED TO WHEN I'LL NEED AN HOUR OVER THREE DA YOU KNOW AN HOUR EACH DAY FOR THREE DAYS
IT YOU CAN END UP HAVING TO TAKE THREE AFTERNOONS OR THREE MORNINGS OR WHATEVER OFF
SO I THINK IN GENERAL AND ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF THE LECTURERS
UH I THINK A LOT OF THE TIME SIMON KIRBY HAS ALREADY SAID TO ME THAT ANYONE ANY OF HIS STUDENTS HE WANTS TO BE ON THE FIRST DAY
ON THE WEDNESDAY RIGHT
AND THAT'S BECAUSE I SHIFTED IT I BASICALLY HAD IT ON MONDAY TUESDAY
WEDNESDAY TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN EVE IT MOVED DOWN TWICE TO WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY
SO WEDNESDAY IS THE ONLY DAY LEFT THAT HE CAN MAKE
SO
YEAH
SO AND THE OTHER THING IS UM WHEN WE GET SOME CALLS SAY WE HAVE
UH FOR INSTANCE THREE PEOPLE SUPERVISED BY BOB LADD
THEN IT MIGHT BE THAT THEN WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO UH CONTACT BOB AND SAY BOB THESE THREE OF YOUR STUDENTS ARE GONNA BE TALKING
UM PRESU PRESUMABLY YOU WANT TO BE THERE
SO CAN YOU GIVE US A TIME THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU
AND THEN WE CAN PUT THEM IN A BLOCK AT ONE TIME
'CAUSE HE SAYS YEAH OKAY THURSDAY AFTERNOON I'VE GOT COMPLETELY FREE
SO I THINK WE DO NEED TO STICK EVERYONE TOGETHER UH PARTICULARLY IF THEY'VE GOT THE SAME SUPERVISOR
AND IT'S ALSO GOOD IF TALKS ARE ON THE SAME TOPIC FOR A WHOLE MORNING OR A WHOLE AFTERNOON BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE WILL COME ALONG AND GO OH
THIS MORNING IT'S ALL ON PHONOLOGY OR THIS MORNING IT'S ALL ON APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AND THEN
OKAY
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ANYWAY
YEAH
NOW WE NEED IF I'M GONNA SEND OUT THIS CALL UH WE NEED A DEADLINE FOR TITLES
SO
UM
WHAT SHOULD WE SAY
SOMETHING LIKE 'CAUSE WE NEED A DEADLINE FOR TITLES AND A DEADLINE FOR ABSTRACTS
SO LET'S SET THE THE LATEST DEADLINE
THE THE UH THE THE SORT OF ABSTRACTS DEADLINE FIRST BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE A MEETING AND THAT'S GONNA BE WHEN ALL THE REAL WORK STARTS
SO WHAT'S THE ABSOLUTE LATEST
I WAS THINK I MEAN MAYBE THE END OF
END OF MARCH MIGHT BE OKAY
UH I'M GOING AWAY FOR TWO WEEKS ON THE FOURTH OF APRIL
AND THEN I'M COMING BACK JUST IN TIME FOR THE CONFERENCE
SO ANY ORGANISING AT LEAST STUFF WHERE I NEED TO BE WHERE WE NEED TO MEET PHYSICALLY HAS TO BE DONE BEFORE THAT
I TELL YOU ONE THING
UH IT'S STARTING ON THE WEDNESDAY AND THE FIRST DAY BACK IS TUESDAY
I THINK I'M COMING BACK
I'M TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT
HOPEFULLY I'LL BE BACK IN TIME THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING THE DAY BEFORE
'CAUSE I THINK I'M GONNA BE BACK
MIGHT EVEN HAVE TO COME IN IN THE EVENING
BUT THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SET SOME THINGS UP
LIKE MAYBE JUST GET THE CHAIRS ORGANISED OR WHATEVER
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO INTO THE ROOMS AND GET THINGS READY
AND THERE'S GONNA BE OTHER THINGS LIKE GETTING THE TECHNOLOGY READY
SO NOT ONLY IS THERE A PRESSURE TO HAVE UH
TALKS THAT ARE ON A SIMILAR TOPIC TOGETHER BUT ALSO IF PEOPLE NEED THE SAME KIND OF COMPUTER SET UP
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THEM TOGETHER SO WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP CHANGING IT
SO BECAUSE I TH I THINK IT WAS CEDRIC HAS ALREADY OFFERED TO DO WHATEVER WE NEED HIM TO DO
BUT HE JUST NEEDS TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT PEOPLE NEED SO THAT HE CAN BE THERE AND AND GET IT READY FOR THEM
SO I THINK WHEN PEOPLE
WELL HOPEFULLY MOST PEOPLE WILL D EITHER HAVE SOMETHING LIKE POWERPOINT OR THEY'LL JUST HAVE UH P. D. F. SLIDES OR SOMETHING
HOPEFULLY NO ONE WILL HAVE ANYTHING TOO SPECIALIZED
S SH Z
YEAH
YEAH IT'S GOT A LOT IN THERE
BUT I THINK IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF I MEAN UH I THINK SOMETIMES MAYBE PEOPLE NEED TO BE IN LINUX RATHER THAN WINDOWS AND SO BOOTING IN AND OUT
M IS SOMETIMES AN ISSUE I THINK
UM
BUT I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD SAY IS WHEN I PUT OUT THIS CALL
I'LL PUT BOTH DEADLINES AND I THINK I'LL SAY THAT WHEN YOU SEND IN YOUR ABSTRACT
YOU NEED TO MENTION THAT ANY TECHNOLOGY YOU INTEND TO USE SO THAT AT LEAST IF WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION YEAH
SO UM SO DEADLINES
UM OKAY SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS
IF IF WE GAVE THEM A WHOLE MONTH OR JUST OVER A MONTH THEN
THAT WOULD BE OKAY WOULDN'T IT BECAUSE WE'VE STILL GOT
OH NO IT WOULDN'T BE OKAY AT ALL
IF WE GAVE THEM THE WHOLE MONTH THAT'D GIVE US HARDLY ANY TIME
SO IF WE GAVE THEM SAY TILL MID MARCH THAT WOULD BE GOOD
SO GIVE THEM SOMETHING LIKE GIVE THEM SOMETHING LIKE TEN DAYS OR WHATEVER TO GET THE TITLE IN
AND THEN GIVE THEM A WEEK ON TOP OF THAT TO GET THE ACTUAL ABSTRACT DONE
AND THE ABSTRACT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MUCH IT'S PROBABLY ONLY HALF A SIDE OF A. FOUR OR SOMETHING ISN'T IT
JUST ENOUGH THAT WE CAN SEE WHETHER IT'S INTERESTING OR WHAT KIND OF AREA IT FITS INTO
THAT'S ALL WE REALLY NEED
UM SEE IDEAL IDEALLY I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE GIVEN THEM A BIT LONGER
BUT I THINK W
THAT WILL BE OKAY
OKAY
SO UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE A CALENDAR
UM SO LET'S JUST
THAT'S TRUE
NO IT'S I THINK IT'S OKAY WHEN YOU'RE NOT WRITING ON THERE
UM SO
SO
UH
THIRTY ONE OH NO IT'S TWENTY EIGHT THIS
THIS MONTH ISN'T IT
TWO THREE FOUR
SO IF WE HAVE IT LIKE A MONDAY MONDAY THE FOURTEENTH'D PROBABLY BE QUITE GOOD FOR THE FINAL DEADLINE
AND THEN UM IF I SEND IT OUT TOMORROW WE'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE THE EL
OR MAYBE THE FOURTH WOULD BE GOOD
SO GIVE THEM A W YEAH A WEEK FOR THE TITLE AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE ABOUT TEN DAYS FROM THEN TO ACTUALLY GET THE ABSTRACT IN
DOES THAT SOUND REASONABLE
JUST PUT IT HERE YEAH
THE ELEVENTH
A BIT EARLIER
SO I'M SAYING A WEEK FROM WHEN I SEND IT OUT
THAT WOULD BE A WEEK ANYWAY
THAT WOULD BE A WEEK ANYWAY BUT YOU CAN GIVE THEM TEN DAYS TO YOU CAN GIVE THEM TEN DAYS TO GET THE TITLE
OR YOU CAN GIVE THEM IT DEPENDS WHICH WAY AROUND YOU WANNA DO IT
SO WHAT'S GONNA TAKE THEM LONGER ACTUALLY TO DECIDE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO AND SEND THE TITLE
OR IS IT GONNA BE ON THE BASIS OF THE TITLE DO THEY WANT MORE TIME TO WRITE THE ABSTRACT
SO GIVE THEM THE SEVENTH YEAH
OKAY SO
SO MONDAY THE SEVENTH IS THE TITLE
AND THIS PRESUMABLY WILL APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD
LIKE UM
AND MONDAY THE FOURTEENTH FOR THE ABSTRACT
WELL WE WE KIND OF HAVE
I D UH WE WERE GIVEN
THE ONLY THING IS ACCE IS ACCESSING THE ACCOUNT
THEY CAN SEND IT TO P. G. C. AT LING AS LONG AS WE CAN GET THE WH I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO THEN
I'LL GO AND SEE MIKE TH TODAY AND AND GET THE PASSWORD AND EVERYTHING
'CAUSE
WE POSSIBLY HAVE IT BUT I'LL JUST SORT THAT OUT WITH HIM
BECAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA TELL EVERYONE TO EMAIL P. G. C. THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE PRETTY SURE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS THE ACCOUNT AND THAT IT'S OPERATIONAL AND STUFF
'CAUSE UH SO FAR I'VE JUST BEEN USING MY OWN UH EMAIL ADDRESS
BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER IT'S QUITE EASY TO SEND F FROM AN EMAIL ADDRESS
'CAUSE YOU CAN SEND FROM ANY EMAIL ADDRESS YOU LIKE
IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT YOU NEED TO P UH IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT WHEN THEY REPLY TO IT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO UH ACCESS IT
SO I ALREADY TRIED IT ONCE AND I'M SURE THEY GAVE US A PASSWORD
AND I EVEN I EVEN ACTU
OH WELL THAT'S IT THEN
NO PROBLEM
THAT'S IT
SO DOES I
I MEAN IT
YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW BUT THE THING IS IF YOU WANT TO SEND THIS CALL FOR ABSTRACTS
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO THE PHILOSOPHY AND AND THINGY ONE
THEN IF YOU WANT TO SEND FROM P. G. C. THEN UH I MEAN YOU MIGHT ALREADY KNOW
BUT YOU CAN GO F IF IF YOU DID IT FROM WEB MAIL
YOU CAN JUST CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT FOR YOURSELF AND WHERE IT SA IT ACTUALLY HAS A SEND FROM ADDRESS
AND YOU CAN JUST PUT P. G. C. AT LING DOT AND JUST DO IT THAT WAY
UH OR DEPENDING ON YOUR NORMAL EMAIL CLIENT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH
THE THE THE OTHER THING YOU COULD DO IS HAVE IS JUST FILL IN THE REPLY TO ADDRESS AS P. G. C. DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANNA DO
BUT THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO
I'LL SEND IT FROM P. G. C. SO IF ANYONE REPLIES IT WOULD JUST GO TO THAT ACCOUNT AND ANY OF US CAN ACCESS IT AT ANY TIME
PRESUMABLY YOU CAN ACCESS FROM WEB MAIL OR YOU KNOW OR I. MAP OR WHATEVER
YEAH IF YOU WANT TO TO CREATE A WEB PAGE AND JUST COPY MY EMAIL INTO IT OR SOMETHING
AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU MIGHT WANNA DO AND THEN LATER ON WE CAN PUT THE UH THE PROGRAMME IN
SO UM
OKAY
IT'S NOT QUITE IT'S P TWO OR THREE MINUTES TO
YOU YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR TWO HAVEN'T YOU
RIGHT
OKAY
SO VERY QUICKLY THEN CAN WE ARRANGE A NEW TIME TO HAVE A MEETING
DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO HOW LONG DO YOU THINK UNTIL WE NEED TO MEET AGAIN
HAVE WE GOT ENOUGH TO BE GETTING ON WITH
WE PROBABLY HAVE HAVEN'T WE
SO I MEAN MAYBE M I MEAN IDEALLY I SUPPOSE WE'LL MEET AGAIN HERE
SO WE CAN WITH MELISSA AND WE'LL JUST SEND OUT AN EMAIL
OKAY
YEP
THAT'S FINE
YEP
SO IF YOU'VE UM IF YOU'RE BACK TO A PAGE THEN YOU TICK IT AGAIN TO LEAVE IT FOR THE SECOND TIME
I DON'T BELIEVE ALL THIS STUFF
IT'S JUST AMAZING
MM-HMM

RIGHT YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
WELL DO WE HAVE UM A D AN IDEA OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE GONNA
ACTUALLY HAVE AT THE WHOLE THING
ANY KIND OF BECAUSE THEN IT BECAUSE SEEMS TO ME IT COULD BE QUITE OBVIOUS
THEN WE JUST SUBTRACT THE NUMBER OF SECOND AND THIRD YEAR STUDENTS AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST I'D I WOULD FAVOUR DOING IT JUST ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS
BUT I MEAN IF WE'RE LIKE SO MEAN WE WERE GONNA DO THIS THING FOR UM I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WAS IT TWO OR THREE DAYS
OKAY
AND SO HOW MANY HOW MANY POSTERS AND TALKS ARE WE GONNA ACTUALLY GONNA GET IN
MM-HMM

MM-HMM
MM-HMM

MM-HMM
I DON'T THINK SO

YEAH
I MEAN OR TWICE IN THE MORNING ONCE IN THE AFTERNOON
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
POSTER SESSION IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE JUST THE PEOPLE PRESENTING THE POSTERS ARE THERE AND CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT
ACTUALLY
THERE'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM AGAIN THEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRESENTING THE POSTERS DON'T GET AROUND TO GO AND LOOK AT OTHERS' POSTERS
BUT LET'S SEE ABOUT THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THIS
FIRST YEARS
OH
ACTUALLY WE HAVE A MESSAGE HERE FROM MITS ABOUT THE POSTER SESSION
POSTER SESSION WAS INTRODUCED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AS PART OF THE MAIN CONFERENCE
IN TWO THOUSAND IT WAS HELD SEPARATELY IN OCTOBER
THE INTENTION WAS TO USE IT AS A WAY TO INTRODUCE INCOMING POST GRAD STUDENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT'S RESEARCH CULTURE
HOWEVER I DID NOT PURSUE THIS IDEA THE FOLLOWING YEAR BECAUSE THE COMMENTS I RECEIVED FROM STUDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND WERE GENERALLY DISCOURAGING
ON THE OTHER HAND I LATER LEARNED THAT SOME STUDENTS DID FIND THE OCTOBER POSTER SESSION QUITE A USEFUL EXPERIENCE
MY SUGGESTION THEREFORE IS TO RE EXAMINE THE IDEA OF POSTER SESSION ALTOGETHER AND FIND A BETTER WAY TO IMPLEMENT IT IF THERE SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH INTEREST IN IT
MM
YEAH
LAST SENTENCE
ONE POSSIBILITY IS TO PUT IT BACK IN THE MAIN CONFERENCE AND LET PEOPLE CHOOSE BETWEEN A PAPER PRESENTATION AND A POSTER
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
BUT A POSTER I MIGHT DO
MM-HMM
ALL THESE DEAD LINGUISTS
MM-HMM
UM WRITE INTO THE CALL THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING THE IDEA OF HAVING A POSTER SESSION
SO PEOPLE CAN INDICATE WOULD THEY PREFER TO GIVE A POSTER OR A TALK
BUT THE ULTIMATE DECISION IS ON OUR SIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEE HOW IT DOES IT WORK OUT WITH THE POSTER SESSION
HOW DOES IT WORK OUT WITH THE TALKS
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEP
JUST
THROW A GENERAL SUGGESTION AT THEM
SEE WHAT HAPPENS
I THINK THEY DO
STILL YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH MIGHT BE INTERESTING STUFF COMING IN
READ SOMETHING RECENTLY ABOUT
I THINK SOMEBODY'S MASTERS PROJECT TO LOOK IN HOW FAR ENGLISH IS ACTU UH OR IN HOW FAR ENGLISH IS A SHAPING INFLUENCE ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OF
YEAH
OR SOME
SOME RELEVANCE CLAUSE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
KIND OF A RELEVANCE CLAUSE
MM-HMM
ADJUST
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I THINK THAT'S
SO FAR IT'S JUST A GENERAL STATEMENT OF INTEREST WHAT WE INTEND TO DO
WHAT WE ACTUALLY GET TO DO WE'LL SEE LATER WHEN WE HAVE THE STUFF
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
TWO WEEKS AHEAD OF
END OF MARCH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH AND I WILL BE AWAY
PROBABLY UNTIL EASTER
SO THIS ACTUALLY MEANS WE HAVE THE WEEK DIRECTLY AFTER EASTER BETWEEN MY COMING BACK AND YOU LEAVING
TO GET THE STUFF DONE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IN MY EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU USUALLY SHOULD HAVE IS SOME KIND OF UM WHAT'S IT OVER HEAD THINGO UM BEAMER
IN SOME CASES WE MIGHT IF IT'S REALLY TOUGH WE MIGHT BE IN NEED OF A OF SOME SOUND SYSTEM TO PLAY RECORDINGS
SHOULD BE THERE YEAH
ADJUSTING
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
NAH
NO WAY ANYMORE
MM NEITHER DO I
MM-HMM
I COULD CREATE US ANOTHER CALENDAR
FOR THE TITLE DEADLINE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
UH F I THINK IF THEY'RE REALLY SERIOUS
TO BE A BIT LATE WITH THE TITLE MIGHT NOT BE BAD BECAUSE IT WILL HELP THEM TO
YEAH
YEP
YEP
GETTING ACCESS TO THE UH TO THE ACCOUNT
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
YEAH
YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
WE'VE GOT IT ALL WRITTEN DOWN
SHOULD I TAKE CARE OF THE WEB PAGE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
NO
NOT QUITE BUT ALMOST
YEAH
UM
MM-HMM
I THINK LATEST S SOON AS THE CALL IS OUT
BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE THE CALL THING WE HAVE THAT AWAY AND LOOK AT THE BOAR ORGANISATORIAL STUFF LIKE UH
DO WE KNOW ABOUT CHAIRS TEA AND STUFF
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
FIND REPLACE YEAH
UH-HUH
OH YEAH
HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU WANT UM I HAD A FEW TIMES WHERE I THOUGHT WELL IT COULD BE THIS
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT IT COULD BE 'CAUSE IT C IT COULD BE A COMBINATION OF SOMETHING ELSE
LIKE PUT THE GUESS DOWN OR LEAVE IT AS AMBIGUOUS IN SOME WAY
RIGHT
THERE'S A CHANCE THEY COULD BE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SO FAR
IT TOOK LI IT LIKE THE THIRD TIME 'TIL I THOUGHT OH YOU'RE SAYING F. FIVE
IT JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE
BUT IF THERE'S A CHANCE THAT IT'S EQUALLY LIKELY THAT THEY COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING OR THEY COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING LIKE ICE CREAM AND I SCREAM
THEN JUST CHOOSE ONE AND LEAVE IT RIGHT
MM-HMM
WE JUST STARTED OUR SPEECH RECOGNITION ASSIGNMENT JUST NOW
YOU'RE AN S. L. P. PERSON
YOU SURVIVED S. P. ONE AND S. P. TWO
WE HAVE TWO NEW TEACHERS FOR S. P. TWO
AND UH I'LL ASK YOU LATER ON LIKE IF YOU STILL HAVE YOUR NOTES
MM THE HYPH
AND YOU ONLY USE THE HYPHEN I THINK WHEN THE SENTENCE IS DEFINITELY NOT CONTINUING ANYWHERE
AS IN LIKE IT'S
MM-HMM
RIGHT
IT WAS THE CREAKY VOICE
CREAKY VOICE
BUT IT IS C REALLY CONNECTED TO THE WORD
CAN WE HEAR IT AGAIN
FROM THE
FROM THE
AND SOMETIMES WITH THE I WOULD BE THINKING ARE YOU ANTICIPATING A OR YOU'RE YOU T TRYING TO SAY THE AND YOU'RE JUST SAYING THE THE THE THE THE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I TRY TO TAKE CONSISTENCY IF THEY ALWAYS STRESS THE WRONG PART OF THE WORD
THEN I THINK OKAY I'LL LET THAT IN BUT IF IF IT COMES OUT AND LIKE ONE WORD IS
AH
WELL AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE A LECTURER THAT CAN I CAN NEVER QUITE S TELL IF HE'S SAYING PROBLEM OR PROGRAMME
PROGRAMME PROBLEM
AND IT I CAN'T ACTUALLY SAY BUT WHEN I'M LISTENING TO I'M THINKING AND I CAN'T TELL
HOPE HE'S NOT INVOLVED WITH THESE ACTUALLY
I HOPE HE'S NOT INVOLVED WITH THIS
THAT'LL GIVE SOME TRANSCRIBER A HEADACHE
IT'S EASY TO 'CAUSE YOU'RE SO USED TO T T TUNING THEM OUT
AND YOU KNOW IT'S EASY WHEN I GO BACK OVER I NORMALLY G LIKE GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING

CHECKING THEIR OWN TRANSCRIPTION
NO TRANSCRIBER WILL BE CHECKING THEIR OWN TRANSCRIPTIONS
GUESS IT DEPENDS HOW FAR YOU CAN STRETCH
OH YEAH 'CAUSE EVERY TIME SOMEBODY'D BE GOING OVER THERE YOU'D HEAR ALL THIS SOUND OF
AND ABOUT FIVE OR SIX BREAKS IN THE BETWEEN IS THE MAKING IT A
LOOKS LIKE SOME PIECE OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
MM-HMM
OH
MM-HMM
I JUST REMEMBERED ONE
OKAY WHEN IT'S JUST AS 'KAY BUT IT'S AT THE BEGINNING OF A SENTENCE SHOULD THE K. BE CAPITALISED
GOOD
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS TOO LONG
GREASE PAINT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THE ARROWS BY THE RESOLUTION
NOT THAT ONE
THE OTHER ARROW NEXT TO IT
YEAH
YEAH
OH
OOH
AH
THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE IT S 'CAUSE I I APPEAR TO HAVE NOTHING
BUT I WAS HEARING STUFF BUT I G THERE WAS NOTHING ON MY WAVE FORM
IT'S KINDA HARD TO FIND WHERE EVERYTHING WAS
CONTROL PANEL
RIGHT
I THINK I'VE GONE A BIT FAR IN CUTTING MINE DOWN AT THE MOMENT
MM-HMM
NO PROBABLY NOT
NO
MM-HMM
EASY FOR CHECKING AT ANY RATE RATHER THAN HAVING TO LISTEN TO A WHOLE ANYTHING
MM-HMM
THE WORK ALLOCATION PAGE
RIGHT
IT DO YES
CHECKING IN PAGE
OH RIGHT
MM-HMM
UH IT'S VAGUELY CONNECTED QUESTION
UM YOU YOU'LL KNOW
UM ORIGINALLY THE LIKE WHEN WE FIRST LIKE REPLIED SAY YES IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DOING THIS IT SAID SIX WEEKS
AND THE CONTRACTS SAY EIGHTH OF MAY WHICH IS LONGER IN ADVANCE THAN WHICH IS A GREATER AMOUNT OF TIME THAN SIX WEEKS
THAT'S
OKAY
RIGHT
OKAY THAT'S
COOL
RIGHT
WHEN IT GETS INTO THE HOLIDAYS AND WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY AROUND IN THE HOLIDAYS AND AND
RIGHT
JUST CHECKING
OR ELSE YOU CAN LIKE P YES
AND IF YOU CAN PLUG MICROPHONES INTO APPLE APPLETON TOWER COMPUTERS I CAN DO IT THERE AS WELL IF YOU WANTED ME
WE COULD MEET UP AND HAVE A SESSION
THAT'S A NICE WAY TO PUT IT
I'M HAVING SORT SOME S I'M HAVING TO SORT SOME TAX STUFF OUT BEFORE I CAN EVEN SEND MY STUFF IN
'CAUSE I NEED TO MAKE SURE I'M SENDING THEM THE RIGHT FORM
BUT THEY WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT EXAMINING BOARD I GOT MY A. LEVELS IN
YEAH FOR HUMAN RESOURCES
I THOUGHT SURELY YOU DON'T NEED THAT INFORMATION
'CAUSE IT TOOK ME IT WAS ABOUT TO TAKE ME HALF AN HOUR WELL IT DID WHEN I WAS LIKE JUST GOING THROUGH THE FORMS AND FILLING IN ALL THE DETAILS
I THOUGHT I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND W
A COUPLE OF HOURS GETTING PHOTO COPIES OF DEGREE CERTIFICATES TO GIVE YOU FOR YOUR FILES IF I'M JUST GONNA BE HERE A GOOD TH THEY WON'T I THINK IT TH AT ONE PLACE IT SAID GIVE US COPIES OF DEGREES
OH MAYBE I'M GETTING MIXED UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT WANTED A
A. LEVEL LIKE EXAMINING BOARD WHICH SEEMED A BIT RIDICULOUS
RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
DIDN'T THINK SO
MM
ALRIGHT
OH SO IT IS YOUR BABY THEN ON THE PHOTOS
ONE ASSUMES THIS
HOW OLD NOW
OH
YEAH THAT'S THE QUESTION I WAS JUST GONNA ASK DOES HE SLEEP
WOW
ALRIGHT
OH DO WE HAVE TO TICK OUR NOTE THING AGAIN WHEN WE FINISH THIS
TO SAY THAT WE'VE
IF NOT MORE YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO THE THREE OF YOU AND LET'S SEE M UM MYSELF AND MAARIKA
WHO'S NOT HERE AND BUT I THINK SO IT IT OCCASIONALLY MELISSA WILL ALL BE DOING CHECKING OF THE TRANSCRIPTIONS
SO THIS IS THE SECOND PASS THESE TRANSCRIPTIONS ARE RECEIVING AND THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD
I THINK YOU ALL KN BASICALLY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT'S INVOLVED
UM BUT THE EXTRA STEP THAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO F IN THIS CASE IS TO LOOK AT THE SILENT REGIONS AND LISTEN TO THEM FOR EACH CHANNEL AND UM MAKE SURE THAT NO BACK CHANNELS WERE LOST FOR EXAMPLE
UM YEAH BACK CHANNELS IS WHAT YOU N TYPICALLY WOULD FIND ALTHOUGH BY AND LARGE THESE ARE GONNA BE SILENT
SO
SO YOU CAN UM START S CHECKING BY Y WELL YOU YOU KNOW
YOU CAN ORDER IT IN ANY WAY YOU LIKE BUT UM START WITH THE FIRST CHANNEL AND GO THROUGH IT ENTIRELY
UM I WOULD RECOMMEND I'VE FOUND THAT IT'S EASIER WHEN YOU'RE CHECKING AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE BOUNDARIES ARE RIGHT FOR A SPEECH SEGMENT
I WOULD RECOMMEND LIKE SAY THIS ONE
GO DOWN HERE TO THE UH TRASCRIPTION TRANSCRIPTION TIER AND SELECT THAT IT SO THAT UH WHEN YOU PLAY
YOU'RE CERTAIN THAT WHEN IT STOPS YOU'VE CAUGHT THE WHOLE SPEECH SIGNAL FOR THAT UTTERANCE AND HAVEN'T LOST ANY SIGNAL INFORMATION
UM OTHERWISE IT IT'S LIABLE TO KEEP ON RUNNING AND YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE WHERE IT WHERE IT FINISHES
SO IT IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME
BUT UM ALTERNATIVELY
I YOU YOU COULD JUST LISTEN TO THE SPEECH SEGMENTS AGAIN AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CORRECT FOR THOSE AND SO YOU COULD JUST HIT UM
AND THEN
LIKE THAT
AND THEN GO BACK AND CHECK THE THE SILENCE REGIONS
HOW IT IF IF YOU WANNA MAKE YOUR JOB A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING YOU CAN D DO IT IN M DIFFERENT WAYS ON A DIFFERENT DAY
IT DOESN'T MATTER
AS LONG AS IT GETS DONE
SO
YEAH YEAH
YOU'RE DOING SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ROLE OF THE CHECKER IS TO CHECK WHAT'S SAID IN THE SILENT REGIONS UH IN THE SPEECH REGIONS AND THEN MAKE SURE NOTHING WAS LOST IN THE SILENT REGIONS
YOU'RE ALSO UM RESPONSIBLE FOR RESOLVING ANY UM UNCERTAINTIES THAT WERE MARKED BY THE ORIGINAL TRANSCRIBER
AND AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THERE ARE GONNA BE M MANY SITUATIONS WHERE YOU LIKE THE FIRST TRANSCRIBER CAN'T MAKE ANY SENSE OF IT
AND IN THAT CASE IT WILL BE UP TO YOU TO USE THE AT SYMBOL
UM AND THAT CAN BE USED UH TO REPRESENT ONE UM UNINTELLIGIBLE WORD OR MULTIPLE INTELLIGIBLE WORDS BUT JUST USE ONE AT SYMBOL
UM YEAH MM-HMM EXACTLY
AND SO THAT UM ONCE YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE S UM SPEECH REGIONS AND ALL THE UM NON SPEECH REGIONS
AN O YOU COULD MAKE ANOTHER STEP OF DOING A SEARCH USING UM GOING UNDER THE EDIT MENU YOU CAN
DO A SEARCH FOR YEAH FIND REPLACE FOR OPEN PARENTHESES AND THAT'LL TAKE YOU TO ANY THAT IT ANY THAT THE FIRST TRANSCRIBER MIGHT HAVE MARKED OUT
SO THERE'S ONE
AND THEN YOU CAN JUST RESOLVE THOSE ALL ONE BY ONE AS AS A DIFFERENT SET OF UM CHANGES ALTOGETHER
AND AND LIKEWISE FOR THE DOUBLE QUESTION MARKS
JUST ONCE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH UM AND RESOLVED ALL THE OPEN PARENTHESES YOU CAN DO THE SAME FOR OP UH DOUBLE QUESTION MARKS
AND UM AND LIKE I SAID IF YOU IF YOU CAN'T MAKE ANY SENSE OF IT THEN JUST USE THE AT SYMBOL
IF YOU CAN UM JUST GIVE IT YOU KNOW GIVE IT YOUR BEST GUESS IN THESE CASES
IF
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH IT'S I WOULD UH IF YOU'RE V IF YOU'RE QUITE CERTAIN THEN I WOULD GO AHEAD AND UM TYPE WHAT YOU THINK IT WAS SAID
IF IF YOU V THINK THAT N Y THERE'S MAYBE A TH THIRTY PERCENT CHANCE YOU'RE WRONG OR OR MORE
YEAH
RIGHT
SO MAYBE A GOOD IDEA WOULD BE TO LISTEN TO EACH CHANNEL ONE BY ONE DO LISTEN TO THE SILENT AND NON SILENT REGIONS AND MAKE ALL THOSE CORRECTIONS
LEAVE THE UNKNOWNS THE UM AMBIGUITIES THE UNCERTAINTIES UNCERTAINTIES UNTIL LATER
SO GO THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS AND DO THAT AND THEN UM THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE THE CONTEXT FROM ALL FOUR SPEAKERS
AND THEN GO BACK AND DO THOSE SEARCHES ONE BY ONE FOR EACH CHANNEL
HOW WOULD THAT BE
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD
OKAY
YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW ALL TOO WELL WHAT WAS SAID IN THIS MEETING BY THE TIME YOU
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL
THAT WOULD HELP US UM YOU KNOW NAB A GOOD NUMBER OF THOSE UNCERTAINTIES
MM
CHOOSE ONE IT C I MEAN Y THINK OF IT FROM A SPEECH RECOGNITION POINT OF VIEW AGAIN
AND ALWAYS THIS SHOULD BE THIS SHOULD MOTIVATE YOU
YEAH
WHAT IS MOST ROBUST FOR A SPEECH RECOGNITION AND AND LEAVE OUT ANYTHING SO YOU'RE WELL GEARED TOWARDS THIS TASK
UM SO I'VE GONE THROUGH SORRY
OH NO NO NO
GO AHEAD GO AHEAD
TOO MANY
OKAY OKAY
SO UM THIS IS ONE I'VE GONE THROUGH
I'VE JUST DONE ONE CHANNEL
AND THERE WERE LOTS OF LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS AS YOU CAN SEE
'CAUSE I'VE GOT SQUARE BRACKETS AROUND ALL THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED
UM SO THIS PERSON DIDN'T HA UM TH OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT CAPITALISATION
SO JUST ABOUT EVERY UTTERANCE NEEDS TO BE CAPITALISED AND AND NEEDS THE END PUNCTUATION
YEAH
UM NO NO NO
WHATEVER UM MAKES SENSE TO YOU
UM BUT NO IT IT CAN CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT SEGMENT AND THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE
UM
YEAH
YEAH
I'LL REVIEW SOME OF THESE THINGS UM AFTER I GO THROUGH THIS A BIT UM JUST TO RE CAP
TH THESE ARE THINGS THAT I'VE AFTER CHECKING UM T EVERYBODY'S WORK UM THESE ARE THINGS THAT WERE COMMONLY LEFT OUT OR YOU KNOW MISC MIS TRANSCRIBED WHATEVER
SO I'LL GO OVER THOSE T AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE WHITE BOARD
UM UM OKAY
SO UH THIS PERSON LEFT OUT A LOT OF END PUNCTUATION AND UM HERE'S A CASE WHERE I THINK SHE WAS TRANSCRIBING AN OUT BREATH UM OR POSSIBLY AN IN BREATH UH T UH IN AND USED THE HASH MARK
IN ANY CASE I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING AND AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE TRANSCRIBING IN BREATHS OR OUT BREATHS
THAT'S N INFORMATION WE DON'T NEED
OH YOU KNOW THIS IS THE HEAD SET MIC AND I HEARD SOMETHING THERE
IT WAS BUT IT WA YEAH IT WAS A BIT OF A YEAH IT WAS CREAKY SO YEAH F UH
YEAH WELL I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IM LET'S SEE WAIT
YEAH
S THERE'S THERE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT MORE IN THERE THAN THAN I HEARD BEFORE
THIS IS SO I W I HEARD A CREAKY VOICE AND IT WAS AUDIBLE OF THE LEVEL OF THE REST OF THE SPEECH
SO I WOULD I WOULD KEEP THAT
I THINK THAT'S GOOD
OH OKAY
I WAS ADDING THAT THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING
THAT MAKES SENSE
OKAY THERE YOU GO
UM SO THERE'S THINGS LIKE THAT
UM SH THERE'S A MISSING FALSE START HERE UM THAT DIDN'T GET CAUGHT
SO I ADDED THAT IN
UM SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE COMMON IN THE TRANSCRIPTIONS THAT I'VE LOOKED AT
MISSED FALSE STARTS UM MISSED M
TRY TO GET IT RIGHT
I MEAN THE IT I THINK SYLLABLES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR FOR TH
YEAH WELL DON'T LET IT DRIVE YOU CRAZY 'CAUSE THERE IS ONE SPEAKER MELISSA JUST PLAYED FOR ME TODAY AND HE STUTTERS HORRIBLY
I MEAN I I I'D YOU KNOW IT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR HIM AND FOR US 'CAUSE IT'S REALLY GONNA BE A NIGHTMARE TO TRANSCRIBE
SO YOU WILL HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE
BUT IF YOU C IF IT'S SAY FOUR REPEATED UM IF THE WORD IS REPEATED FOUR TIMES UH THEN THAT'S NOT TOO HARD TO COUNT
I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS ANYTHING EXCEEDING FOUR I DON'T THINK
HAVE YOU
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MAKE YOUR BEST GUESS
TRY TO LISTEN TO IT CAREFULLY ENOUGH BUT NOT NOT SO THAT YOU'RE OBSESSING OVER IT FOR TOO LONG
I WOULD SAY
ALRIGHT
WELL THERE AGAIN F UH THINK ABOUT ROBUSTNESS AND SPEECH UH RECOGNITION AND IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S A WORD FRAGMENT WHO CARES
IT YOU'RE MARKING IT AS A FRAGMENT AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT
WELL UM I WOULDN'T DE BE USING THE STAR SO LIBERALLY UM FOR A NON NATIVE SPEAKER
MM-HMM
WELL RIGHT RIGHT
UM I MEAN AND AND FOR THAT MATTER A LOT OF N NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS' REALISATIONS AREN'T GOING TO BE SO TRUE TO UM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WELL I WOULDN'T BOTHER TO MARK ALL OF THOSE INSTANCES THOUGH
NO I MEAN YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE UH YOU'RE GONNA FIND THAT FOR ANY SPEAKER THEY HAVE A SET WAY OF OF REALISING THESE THINGS
AND AND IT'S JUST LIKE FIONA WAS SAYING UM THAT THE THE WORD THAT STANDS OUT IS SOMETHING REALLY UH ABERRANT
LIKE UM I'M THINKING OF I I'VE USED THIS EXAMPLE BEFORE
THERE'S A GUY WHO SAYS PROJECT INSTEAD OF PRODUCT AND UH IT'S SOMETHING LIKE PROJECT AND IT'S PROBABLY JUST HIS HIS PRONUNCIATION OF OF
YEAH
WELL IT IT THEY WERE CLEARLY TALKING ABOUT A PRODUCT
SO SO UH I M I MARKED THAT AS A M UH MISPRONUNCIATION OR S OR SOMETHING TO FLAG ANYWAY
OH EVALUATION
YEAH I I'VE I REMEMBER THAT
THAT ONE I WOULD I WOULD FLAG JUST LIKE YOU DID
IT THAT'S SOMETHING DEFINITELY TO MARK UP
MM YEAH
THAT'S GOOD
THAT'S GOOD
ALRIGHT
YEAH I KN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO S TELL YOU ABOUT N UM CERTAIN SPEAKERS
I IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO OOP I LOST MY LAPEL LAPEL MIC
YEAH
WAIT
OOPS
LEAST I WON'T BE TRANSCRIBING THE WHAT DO I CARE
OKAY SO UM THERE'VE THERE'VE BEEN LOTS OF MISSED FILLED PAUSES
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO MISS THOSE SOME MORE THAN OTHERS
SO JUST REALLY KEEP AN EAR OUT FOR THOSE
UM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
I I'M NOT SURE I MISS THEM PLENTY MYSELF
BUT UM THIS THIS SECOND PASS WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO CATCH ALL OF THEM OR AT LEAST MOST OF TH YEAH
NO NO
AFTER
OKAY
YEAH IT SHOULD BE AFTER EVERY UM ACRONYM LETTER
YEAH YEAH
SO AT THIS POINT THE UM THE ONLY FILE THAT'S BEEN CHECKED IS MELISSA ONE THAT MELISSA DID AND THAT WAS CHECKED BY ME
UM SO W WE WE'RE STARTING FRESH WITH THESE AND YOU KNOW
CHANGES LIKE THAT THAT WERE JUST ANNOUNCED WE'LL WE'LL BE ABLE TO CATCH FOR THESE FIRST PASSES
SO YEAH Y IF YOU DO SEE UM SOMETHING LIKE UM U. H. M. FOR UM YOU YOU WOULD CHANGE THAT TO THE REGULARISED V VERSION
UM AND WE JUST CH YOU KNOW THIS IS ARBITRARY BUT WE HAD TO CHOOSE SOMETHING AND NOT LET IT GET TOO CONVOLUTED WITH UM WITH CHOICE
HERE'S
UH-HUH
MM-HMM THERE
UM I
YEAH YEAH
SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY RESTARTING THE SENTENCE BUT JUST A RESTART OF ANY TYPE
A PHRASE
YEAH
THANK YOU FOR THAT DESCRIPTION BEATA
HERE'S A UH SO THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THIS ONE UP HERE
OKAY
HERE'S WHERE I'VE I HEARD A ANOTHER SOUND ANOTHER FALSE START
UM OR A STUTTER I WOULD SAY
LET ME SEE
OH YEAH
I'M NOT SEEING WHERE THIS IS
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
OKAY
SO THAT KIND OF THING
AND THERE WAS A VOWEL IN THERE BUT YOU NOTICED THAT SHE JUST USED THE AND THAT'S FINE
THE THE LETTER D.

UM UH UP HERE

I
IT'S ONE WORD
SO I D I JUST SAID SPELLING
IT'S AN ADMONISHMENT
SORRY
UH LIKE A. T. IS UH
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH YEAH
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT SPELLINGS I I I THINK I M MIGHT HAVE SENT AN EMAIL TO THIS EFFECT JUST CHECK THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY ONLINE
UH AND THAT'S THAT WILL BE OUR GUIDE
UM SO A AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS IS JUST MISSING AN E. CETERA
UM BUT ANYWAY
YOU CAN
WE'VE CONSIDERED EXPERIMENTING WITH RUNNING THIS THROUGH A SPELL CHECK
YOU COULD TAKE THIS AS AN EMACS FILE AND RUN A SPELL CHECK ON IT
BUT I THINK IT WOULD SLOW THINGS DOWN TOO MUCH
SO JUST HOPEFULLY I IN GOING THROUGH THIS VERY CAREFULLY YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE THESE MISSPELLINGS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH I TH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
SO WE'LL WE WILL JUST HOPE THAT YOU CATCH IT
UM THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO
OKAY
SO
SORRY
SO I THINK SHE JUST SHE DIDN'T CATCH THE FULL FORM
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
SHE I THINK SHE MEANT TO USE THE INFINITIVE BUT SHE JUST LEFT OFF THE TO
A SPACE BETWEEN SHE WOULD LIKE SEE
SHE WOULD LIKE SEE
YES YES YES YOU'RE RIGHT
YEAH
EXACTLY
UH THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE M REMARKING ABOUT
OKAY
THERE WE GO
LET ME SAVE THAT
OKAY
WHAT ELSE
UM BE CAREFUL ABOUT UM FINDING MIS TRANSCRIPTIONS
SO UM
SO SHE T SHE TRANSCRIBED THAT AS WOULD
AND SO
WELL I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR THERE
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE GONNA BE CA
NO YOU TRY TO KEEP IT AS TRUE TO WHAT'S BEING SAID
THEN USE UM
MM-HMM
I'D HAVE TO HEAR IT BECAUSE IT M SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE A FRAGMENT
UH IT JU I'D JUST HAVE TO HEAR IT
UM M I'D YOU DON'T WANT TO B UM BE PRESCRIPTIVE AND AND TYPE WHAT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD'VE SAID
BUT
BUT I I I DO KNOW THE TYPE OF SCENARIO YOU'RE DESCRIBING
I JUST IT'S JUST HARD TO ANSWER THAT WITHOUT HEARING SOMETHING
MM
YEAH THEY SHOULD ALL I I STOPPED MARKING THEM 'CAUSE THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY
BUT
UH LET'S SEE
OH YEAH Y YOU'RE RIGHT
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
OKAY
THERE WAS A YES IN THERE
UM AND
YES
SO ANOTHER MISSED FALSE START
UM
THERE WAS CREAKINESS ON THE SHE
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO MARK THAT AS A SEPARATE SOUND
UM
MM
IF IT SOUNDS LIKE UM THE LAUGHTER IS JUST UM INTERRUPTING A AN UTTERANCE THAT CONTINUES AFTER THE LAUGHTER I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT CAPITALISING
IF YOU HEAR JUST LAUGHTER ON EITHER SIDE YEAH DO THAT
YEAH YEAH MM I DON'T KNOW WE'LL HAVE TO I'LL
OKAY SO LAUGHTER DURING SPEECH
I'LL F I'LL TALK TO MELISSA AND JEAN
S
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO WE DON'T HAVE ANY QUAL TAGS LIKE THEY USE
BUT UM I'LL F I'LL
I'LL FIGURE THAT ONE OUT AND PUT IT UP ON THE WIKI OR EMAIL YOU
GOOD QUESTION
I'VE COME ACROSS THAT AS WELL
MM SEE
OH YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT THAT NOISE WAS INDICATING
UM WE CAN SKIP ON
THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF THINGS I WANNA POINT OUT
UM LET'S SEE
OKAY
DID YOU
DID SHE SAY CIRCUIT
I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR THAT
SO WOULD WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO PUT AN ASTERISK AFTER THAT
UH YEAH
OH OKAY
NO NOT NECESSARILY
NO IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNIZER IS LIABLE TO TRIP UP ON I THINK
MM-HMM MM-HMM
UM Y THAT MAY BE BUT I PROBABLY WOULD FLAG IT
I DEPENDING ON HOW HOW DIFFERENT THE VOWEL SOUND WAS
IT'S GONNA BE YOUR CALL IN A LOT OF THESE CASES
MM
OKAY HERE
HERE'S A CASE OF UM WHERE I FOUND IT N UH FOUND A CASE OF DISCONTINUITY
BUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE SHE'S A NON NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER I DON'T I DON'T KNOW
MAYBE THAT WAS GRAMMATICALLY N UH
UNMARKED FOR HER
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
MAYBE THAT WASN'T UH HER RE STARTING MAYBE SH THAT WAS
MM MM-HMM MM-HMM
SO AGAIN I DON'T KNOW
THAT W THAT WAS MY REFLEX AT THE TIME TO PUT THAT THERE
BUT
YEAH
WELL
UNLESS YOU KINDA GET RIGHT
UH YEAH YEAH
YEAH I WOULD TYPE IT AS TWO
MM OKAY I'M GONNA SKIP AHEAD
OH LET'S SEE THERE WAS A C
SO I I HEAR SHE WOULD QUITE CLEARLY THERE AND I THINK A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RESOLVE JUST JUST HELPS TO HAVE THE CONTEXT AND BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO IT AGAIN
WELL
OKAY
YES IT COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS
UM
SO THERE IS THERE IS ANOTHER CASE WHERE THERE WASN'T A SPACE BETWEEN UH
A NON WORD FRAGMENT AND UM
A RE START
OKAY
WHAT ELSE
THERE IS AN EXTRA LITTLE SYMBOL IN HERE AND THAT WAS JUST KINDA CARELESSNESS
UM
SO D EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING AS BRIEF AS MM-HMM WE'RE WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CAPITALISE THAT
AND MAARIKA ASKED ME WHAT TO DO IN THE CASE OF AN UTTERANCE JUST CONSISTING OF LAUGHTER
DO WE DO WE USE PUNCTUATION IN THESE CASES AND I DON'T KNOW
I HAVEN'T BEEN
I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY
YEAH
UH NO
UM
DELETE AND COLLAPSE
I'M TRYING TO UNDERST I'M TRYING TO INTERPRET MY NOTE HERE
DELETE AND COLLAPSE THE SURROUNDING SEGMENTS
OKAY I GUESS THERE THERE JUST REALLY WASN'T ENOUGH TO TRANSCRIBE THERE
YEAH
YEAH
SO LIKE I SAID CLICK DOWN HERE JUST TO IF YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED THAT TRICK ALREADY
AND THAT WON'T PLAY ANY SURROUNDING SEGMENTS
SO THERE'S NOTHING THERE WORTH TRANSCRIBING
UM
UH
UH-HUH
THIS ONE
OH SO YOU HAVEN'T PUT A HYPHEN THERE
I SEE I SEE
YEAH
OKAY
COMMAS
COMMAS DID YOU SAY
OH
FOR G FOR THAT S TYPE OF SITUATION
YEAH OKAY
COMMAS ARE FINE
I MEAN THEY'RE EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE EXTRACTED GLOBALLY SO IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU USE THE COMMA
YEAH WE CAN JUST WIPE THEM OUT IN ONE FELL SWOOP
I I AM TOO
I I LIKE COMMAS AND THEN UH STEVE RENALS WHO'S PROJECT MANAGER HAD A LOOK AT M I THINK IT WAS MY TRANSCRIPTIONS
WHAT ARE ALL THESE COMMAS DOING IN HERE
BUT HE DIDN'T HE ULTIMATELY HE SAID IT WASN'T A PROBLEM
THEY WILL I TH THEY'LL HELP IN THE CASE OF DISCOURSE MARKING BUT HIS POINT WAS THAT THEY'RE REALLY SUBJECTIVE
I MEAN SOMETHING THAT YOU THE TRANSCRIBER HERE YEAH YEAH
I REALLY LIKE USING COMMAS
OH
SH OH SHE SPELLED CUTEST UM WITH AN I. SO THAT THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I POINTED OUT
OKAY WHAT ELSE
UM
SO HERE'S LET'S SEE
NOW THIS WAS OUR
SO SHE TYPED UH OUR AND I I DIDN'T QUITE HEAR THAT
BUT
BUT I YOU CAN SEE HOW IT COULD'VE BEEN I DON'T KNOW
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
RIGHT
AND YOU CAN NEVER KNOW BUT IF IT FITS WELL ENOUGH AS A AS AN INDEFINITE ARTICLE THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL
OH I WAS S I WAS SUGGESTING THAT SH IT BE UH INSTEAD OF OUR
BUT
YEAH I IT'S TRICKY IT GETS AMBIGUOUS
UM I DON'T KNOW
UH WHAT'S THIS
WELL OH SHE'S
I HEAR THE WELL THERE
THE BUT THIS BEING A HEAD SET MIC CHANNEL M MAY MAKE IT EASIER TO HEAR
SHE TRANSCRIBED FROM THE LAPEL MIC
UH
OH
OH
OH GOD
AND YOU TRANSCRIBED THAT SPEAKER ENTIRELY
IF THAT COMES UP AGAIN WE'VE GOT UM HEADSET MIC FILES NOW
IN FACT THEY REPLACED ALL THE LAPEL MIC FILES ON THE M. M. M. SERVER WITH HEAD SET MIC FILES
WHICH WE WEREN'T ASKING THEM TO DO BUT ANYWAY THEY DID IT
AND SO NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE LAPEL MIC FILES
APPARENTLY THE HEADSET MIC FILES ARE ARE JUST A BIT LOUDER
AND SO YOU'LL F PROBABLY FIND YOURSELF TURNING THE VOLUME DOWN CONSIDERABLY
BUT BUT APPARENTLY OTHER THAN THAT THEY'RE JUST AS GOOD
BUT LET US KNOW BECAUSE WE CAN RETRIEVE THE THE OTHER FILES
YEAH
OH
OKAY
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA GO THROUGH UH ANY MORE OF THESE BECAUSE I I THINK I'VE GOTTEN THROUGH MOST OF THE TYPES THAT I MEANT TO POINT OUT
UH RIGHT RIGHT
UM WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO FOR THAT
I D I DID SEE S I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME GUIDELINES FOR ANOTHER CORPUS AND I DID SEE SOMETHING ABOUT PROPER NAMES
SO I'LL I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THAT AND SEE HOW WE CAN HANDLE THAT HERE
WHAT
UH YEAH QUITE POSSIBLY BUT SINCE IT'S COMING FROM ICSI UH IT'S COMING FROM IDIAP IN SWITZERLAND
YEAH IT W IT SHOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO GET BUT IT'S IT'S ONE OTHER STEP
YOU KNOW EMAILING SOMEBODY TO FIND OUT WHO KNOWS THIS INFORMATION
ANYWAY IT'S
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE EVERYONE SIGNS A CONSENT FORM WHEN THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE EXPERIMENT
SO WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT
BUT BUT THERE SHOU WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE A W A MEANS OF DEALING WITH PROPER NAMES WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS OR HOW IT MIGHT BE SPELLED AT ALL AND AND FLAGGING THAT IN IN SOME WAY
SO I'LL TH I'LL I'LL TRY TO ADDRESS BOTH THINGS
OH JUST JUST TYPE MISTER FULLY
I M. I. S. T. E. R. YEAH
AND SAME WITH MISSUS M. I. S. S. U. S. I BELIEVE
IS IT I BELIEVE I BELIEVE CHECK CHECK THE DICTIONARY
THAT YEAH BUT YOU WOULD NEVER UM TYPE THE ABBREVIATED SPELLING FOR ANYTHING
UM WELL I'M SURE THERE'S A SPELLING IN THE O. E. D. YEAH
UH-HUH
OH RIGHT
SO THE TRANSCRIBER'S ENCLOSING EVERYTHING IN CARETS AND WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE YOU WILL BE LEAVING QUESTION MARKS THERE
UM OKAY
RIGHT
UM IT SHOULDN'T BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE LEFT LIKE THE ASTERISK WILL BE LEFT FOR THE PROC THE SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING
BUT CARETS WITH QUESTION MARKS IN BETWEEN WOULD HAVE TO BE RESOLVED IN SOME WAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I I SUPPOSE THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO REALLY
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE POLYGLOT TRANSCRIBERS HERE
OH YEAH YEAH
IF YOU IF IF F IT'S A FOREIGN WORD AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS JUST ENCLOSE IT IN CARETS
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
IF YOU IF YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT YOU'VE GOT A FAIR GRASP ON FRENCH FOR EXAMPLE WHY NOT
YEAH
OKAY
UM THERE IS THERE IS JUST ONE OTHER THING SHE SHE TYPED OKAY UM IN CAPS
O. C C O. CAPITAL O. CAPITAL K. AND HUGE NO NO I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE MISSED THAT IN THE IN THE GUIDELINES
YEAH
IT IS O. K. A. Y.
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
WELL IT WILL BE YOUR JOBS TO CATCH ALL OF THESE THINGS
SO NO UM N NO TRANSCRIBER WILL BE CHECKING NO CHECKER WILL BE CHECKING THEIR T OWN TRANSCRIPTION
YES
YES
SO WE WILL CATCH THESE THINGS
MORE EFFICIENTLY I THINK
AND ON SO I'LL JUST GO UP TO THE BOARD DO I HAVE TO KEEP THIS STUFF ON
OH YEAH THEY'VE GOT CLIPS
RIGHT I'M MOBILE
ALRIGHT
OKAY
SO I GUESS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF USING THE WHITE BOARD AND KILLING A LITTLE MORE TIME I'LL JUST WRITE DOWN THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST COMMON TO BE CHECKED
SO LET'S SEE
SO OH OKAY
NOW
OKAY S ALRIGHT
RATHER THIS IS A LIST OF THINGS TO DO AS THE CHECKER
SO YOU WANNA LISTEN TO THE SILENT REGIONS
THEN CHECK THE SPEECH REGIONS
AND AS PART OF THAT YOU WANT TO UM CHECK THE BOUNDARIES
AND OH BY THE WAY THIS SHOULD BE UM
UM TRANSCRIBE
ANY MISSED SPEECH
AND JUST LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE
OKAY
AND WITHIN THIS CHECKING THE SPEECH SEGMENTS YOU WANT TO LISTEN FOR OR LOOK FOR MISSED UM
LOOK FOR MISSED PUNCTUATION
FILLED PAUSES
WORDS IN STUTTERING
AND IF YOU HAVE UM IF YOU HAVE A STUTTERED WORD YOU DON'T NEED TO USE THE HYPHEN TO MARK DISCONTINUITY
IT'S JUST SO IF SOMEBODY SAYS THE THE THEN IT'S JUST THE THE
UM WORDS IN ST UH
AND WHAT ELSE
TRY TO GET F FALSE STARTS
SHORT WORDS MAKE SURE WITH LITTLE WORDS LIKE THE AND UH LITTLE ARTICLES AND THAT KIND OF THING DON'T GET OMITTED
UM SHORT WORDS AND WORD FRAGMENTS
THOSE ARE THE COMMONLY MISSED THINGS
AND THEN UM LOOK FOR CASES OF MIS TRANSCRIPTION
SEEMS SO SILLY TO BE WRITING THIS ALL
BUT ANYWAY MIS TRANSCRIPTION SO MAKE SURE IF THE SPEAKER SAID WILL
YOU TYPE WILL NOT WOULD OR UM IF THEY SAY WE EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT BE MORE GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT TO TYPE WE'RE UM THAT KIND OF THING
UM THA CASES OF ELLIPSIS WHERE UM MAYBE THE TRANSCRIBER TYPED THEM BUT REALLY WHAT WAS SAID WAS 'EM SO WHERE YOU USE THE APOSTROPHE
AND LOOK FOR CAPITALISATION I'M NOT GONNA GONNA DO ANY MORE OF THIS
CAPITALISATION
SPELLING
UM USE THE O. E. D. TO CHECK ON THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT
UM REFER TO THE WIKI FOR ALL REGULARISED SPELLINGS AND F FOR THINGS LIKE FILLED PAUSES
OH WAS THAT
W
AND THEN YEAH CAPITALISE THE K.
YEAH
AND
I THINK SMELLS REALLY GOOD
I USED TO ALWAYS LOVE SMELLING MARKERS
WHAT ELSE DID I FIND
UM THE SO MAKE SURE THE DA THE DASH THE HYPHEN WHATEVER YOU CALL IT
IS BEING USED APPROPRIATELY IN CASES OF DISCONTINUITY UM BUT NOT IN STUTTERING LIKE I SAID
AND AND DON'T USE IT WHEN THE UTTERANCE IS CLEARLY CONTINUED IN THE NEXT SEGMENT OR WHATEVER
UM DON'T TRANSCRIBE IN BREATHS OR OUT BREATHS
AND OKAY SHOULD NEVER BE UM TWO CAPITAL LETTERS IT SHOULD BE O. K. A. Y.
UM AND ONE OTHER THING IS TO BREAK BREAK UP LONG SEGMENTS IF YOU FIND ANY
SO
YEAH BUT THAT'S A KIND OF CRUDE GUIDELINE
I'D I'D SAY JUST ANYTHING THAT SEEMS UNMANAGEABLE
AH
YEAH YEAH
REALLY UH IT IT MEANS NOTHING TO SAY A MINUTE IT'S JUST A G A REALLY CRUDE GUIDELINE
I WOULD JUST TRY TO KEEP SEGMENTS VERY MANAGEABLE UM AND A BUT U YOU KNOW USE THESE WAVE FORMS TO HELP YOU
AND YOU CAN ADJUST THE RESOLUTION SO THAT OH
THAT DIDN'T HELP ME TOO MUCH BUT YOU CAN USE THIS LITTLE SLIDE BAR TO ADJUST THE RESOLUTION
ACTUALLY THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING
WHICH O
YEAH
RIGHT OKAY OKAY
SO YEAH
MM-HMM
OH OKAY RIGHT
UH-HUH
HMM
AH RIGHT THAT'S GOOD
OKAY
THAT'S EXCELLENT
ALRIGHT
OH THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW
OKAY
YEAH SO TO HELP YOU MAKE CUTS JUST LOOK LOOK F YOU KNOW USE THIS WAVE FORM AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT L LOSING ANY SIGNAL INFORMATION
BUT UM CUTTING SEGMENTS DOWN IS A L A LOW PRIORITY BUT IT IT WILL HELP ULTIMATELY I THINK POST PROCESSING WISE
I DON'T
YEAH YOU DON'T DON'T GET EXCESSIVE ABOUT IT
'CAUSE THAT JUST ENDS UP TAKING TOO MUCH TIME
BUT I D I THINK FROM A SPEECH RECOGNITION POINT OF VIEW IT SHOULDN'T MATTER THESE SEGMENTS BEING WHATEVER LENGTH THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE
I'VE SEEN OTHER P PEOPLE'S TRANSCRIPTION GUIDELINES LIKE F FOR THE UM ICSI PROJECT AT BERKELEY AND ELSEWHERE SAY INDICATING THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER AND IT'S THE POINT IS JUST TO GET 'EM INTO MANAGEABLE UNITS
AND
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE ACTUALLY THAT'S THE BEST REASON FOR CUTTING THEM DOWN
BUT HOPEFULLY THE THAT'LL BE DONE DURING THE FIRST PASS BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
MAKING THE CHECKERS' JOB A LITTLE EASIER
UM AND THEN YEAH JUST M UM BE SURE AFTER YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE FOUR CHANNELS TO UM DO A SEARCH ON ALL THE UNKNOWNS
ALL THE UM CASES OF AMBIGUITY OR WHATEVER
AND WHAT ELSE WAS I GONNA SAY
THE WAY WE'LL BE ALLOCATING THIS IS IS THE SAME AS BEFORE TH IT'S GONNA BE ON THE TH THE SAME THE SAME PAGE JUST FURTHER DOWN
SCROLL DOWN YOU'LL SEE W ALL THE FILES
AND UH I'VE ALREADY ALLOCATED SOME SOME THINGS TO BE CHECKED
SO IF YOU RUN OUT OF WORK GO AHEAD AND START CHECKING BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S UM CONSIDERABLY UM BOTTLE NECKED AT THE MOMENT
YEAH I'D SAY FOR NOW UM W WE DON'T EVEN HAVE UH MUCH NEW STUFF TO BE UH TO BE GONE OVER FOR A FIRST PASS
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE D UM DO THIS SECOND PASS
AND I'VE INDICATED IN A COLUMN WHETHER SOMETHING IS PRIORITY
M I THINK I HIGH TYPED HIGH IF IT'S HIGH PRIORITY
UM SO D THOSE WOULD BE THE ONES YOU WOULD FOCUS ON FIRST OBVIOUSLY
AND WHEN IT COME YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE FILE NAME IN ANY WAY
JUST KEEP IT THE SAME
UM THERE THERE IS GOING TO BE A CHECKING IN PROCEDURE
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY'S MENTIONED THIS BEFORE BUT YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW ABOUT THIS WITH THE C. V. S. SERVER
SO TH
RIGHT BUT IT'S BE S Y SIMILAR
BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE CREATING A THEIR A GUY JONATHAN IS CREATING A WEB FORM FOR YOU TO DO THIS ALL VERY SIMPLY AND LIKE JUST UM UPLOAD EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE UH UP UPLOAD THE FILE THAT YOU'VE TRANSCRIBED AND AND YOU'LL BE NOTING WHETHER IT'S THE FIRST PASS OR THE SECOND PASS AND Y YOUR NAME UM AS THE PERSON WHO DID THAT PARTICULAR PASS
AND THAT WILL HAPPEN SOON
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH YOU'LL HAVE TO I WOULD SUGGEST CREATING A F FOLDER UM CALLED FILES TO BE CHECKED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
AND THEN WITHIN THAT CREATE A S CREATE SUB FOLDERS FOR THE THE GIVEN MEETING AND YOU'LL HAVE TO GET ALL THE SOUND FILES UNFORTUNATELY FROM THE M. M. M. SERVER ON YOUR OWN
BECAUSE THE THE AMI SERVER'S NOT VERY RELIABLE FOR GETTING THESE SOUND FILES UNCORRUPTED
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO GET ALL THE SOUND FILES FROM THE M. M. M. SERVER AND THE PERSON'S TRANSCRIPTION FILE SHOULD BE IN THAT FOLDER WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING YOURS
UM AND THEN YOU'LL JUST UH YEAH D YOU'LL COPY THAT OVER YOU WON'T DON'T MOVE IT OVER
BECAUSE WE WANNA HAVE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF THESE THINGS BUT YEAH COPY IT INTO YOUR DIRECTORY AND KEEP THE SAME NAME
AND THEN WHEN YOU CHECK IT IN IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE REGISTERED EVEN THOUGH THE THE FIRST PASS WAS CHECKED IN WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS CHECKING IN BUSINESS
UM IT WILL KNOW WHICH PASS IT IS BUT I THINK YOU'LL ALSO BE INDICATING THAT AS WELL
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S IT' ACTUALLY SIX WHAT IS IT
IS IT THREE MONTHS I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
THEY'RE THEY'RE THREE MONTH CONTRACTS AND NOW IF YOU CAN'T KEEP THAT THAT'S FINE
BUT IT'S JUST A LOGISTIC THING WITH PERSONNEL WHERE WHERE WE HA THAT WAS THE MINIMUM WE WERE ABLE TO OFFER A CONTRACT FOR
SO IF YOU HAVE TO BOW OUT LET US KNOW AS SOON AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STOP
YEAH YEAH OBVIOUSLY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE THINGS WE'LL HAVE TO WORK AROUND BUT UM YEAH IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE DETAILS
MM-HMM
I SHOULD THINK SO
I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT W OF KEEPING WELL AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO YEAH
WORK OUT USE OF YOUR COMPUTER WITH THE OTHER PERSON THAT'S FINE YEAH
THE THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING M REGULAR HOURS WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY WAS HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS
BUT YOU'VE GOT KEYS SO SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IN DURING ODD HOURS IF IF YOU WANTED TO WORK
YEAH YEAH
YEAH I DON'T SEE WHY NOT AS LONG AS YOU'RE YOU KNOW DOING YOUR GIVEN SET OF HOURS FOR THE WEEK
YEAH
AND UM YEAH
PAYM I I THINK YOU'LL ALL BE PAID
I THINK YOU'LL ALL BE PAID UH WELL HAVE YOU NOT
MM
OKAY
OKAY
REALLY
NO THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT NECESSARY
MM NO
WELL IT
IF YOU HAVE ANY TH PROBLEMS LIKE THAT MM UM SEE CAROLINE HASTINGS
I MEAN IF IT'S FOR THIS JOB AND AND GETTING PAID THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARY AND CAROLINE HASTINGS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU SORT THAT OUT
BUT J ALSO IF IF PAY IS A MATTER UM LIKE IF IT'S A MATTER THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN PAID FOR SOME REASON
UM I HOPE THAT'S NOT NOT THE CASE
MM-HMM
TALK TO CAROLINE
YEAH 'CAUSE I'VE I REALLY DON'T KNOW UM WHY THAT WOULD BE
I'M HERE FULL TIME NOW SO I'LL I'LL BE HERE M MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AND I L I LEAVE AT FOUR NOW
SO YOU WON'T FIND ME ANYTIME AFTER THAT
BUT
YEAH MY HUSBAND'S AT HOME WITH THE BABY
YEAH YEAH
HE'S UH FOUR AND HALF MONTHS
IT'S VERY LOVELY
A NICE JOLLY LITTLE BABY
YEAH WELL UM ONLY AS OF FRIDAY ACTUALLY
SO HE WAS UH I WAS JUST TELLING MELISSA THIS DO YOU WANT US TO STOP
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OH GOOD THAT WORKED OUT WELL
MORE
IT'S USUALLY A CONTEXT PROBLEM BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES IF IT'S NOT INTELLIGIBLE YOU EITHER TEND TO BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT IT TO FIT THE CONTEXT
UM YOU TEND TO TAKE THE CLOSEST ACTUAL WORD THAT WOULD FIT THE CONTEXT
OR IF IT SOMETIMES IT SOUNDS VERY CLEAR AS A WORD ITSELF BUT THEN WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL
AND THEN YOU M QUESTION YOU KNOW SECOND GUESS WHETHER IT'S REALLY WHAT YOU HEARD
MM
HMM
BE ROBUST
THAT'S ALWAYS FUN
I'VE DONE THAT TOO
OH NEVER I I DON'T WANNA INTERRUPT IT
UH UH WHEN I DID MY MASTERS UM I TOOK UH S. P. ONE AND S. P. TWO WITH SIMON KING
YES
AND ACTUALLY I'VE DONE QUITE WELL IN S. P. ONE I'VE DONE IT A BIT WORSE IN S. P. TWO BECAUSE IT WAS A L A LOT MORE CHALLENGING
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT
OKAY
BACK TO THE TOPIC
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY THE ONLY CASE WHERE YOU DON'T OR WHERE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO CAPITALISE RIGHT
SO IF IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THE SENTENCE IS BEING CARRIED ON THE P YOU KNOW
THE SENTENCE FROM THE PREVIOUS SEGMENT IS BEING CARRIED ON THEN THAT'S WHEN YOU DON'T CAPITALISE
OTHERWISE YOU DO
YES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND YOU SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW REALLY WHETHER IT'S A MIC NOISE OR THAT PERSON IS MAKING THAT NOISE
YEAH
OKAY
AND HOW EXACT DO WE HAVE TO BE THERE
BECAUSE UM YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE TEND TO STUTTER MORE THAN OTHERS AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE A FALSE START FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN A ROW
AND HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO LISTEN TO IT REALLY UNTIL YOU'VE GOT THE EXACT NUMBER OF A THINGS RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
WELL 'CAUSE SOMETIMES THEY GO YOU KNOW LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHETHER IT'S THREE TIMES OR FOUR YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL IT'S NOT THAT THE WORD IS IF THE WORD WERE THE WHOLE WORD WERE BEING USED FOUR TIMES
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT DIFFICULT BUT SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A FALSE START
WHICH IS REALLY JUST MAYBE ONE OR ONE AND A HALF PHONES AND THEN REPEATED AND THEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHETHER ONE IS A LONG DURATION OF ONE OR WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY TWO
AND THAT KIND OF THING SO IT'S I THINK IT WAS A WORD STARTING WITH D. AND THE PERSON WAS GOING OR S YOU KNOW
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
WELL SPEAKING ABOUT
SPEAKING ABOUT ROBUSTNESS IF IF SOMEBODY HAS AN ACCENT THAT YOU CAN ONLY REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING DUE TO WORLD KNOWLEDGE YEAH IT WHAT THEY SAY
IT DOESN'T REALLY ACTUALLY SOUND AT ALL YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
THEN DO YOU TRANSCRIBE MORE PHONETICALLY OR DO YOU PUT UH UH A STAR OF AFTER EVERY SINGLE ONE WORD
OR
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT BUT UM THE ONE THERE'S ONE I'M TRANSCRIBING RIGHT NOW
YOU KNOW A WHOLE BATCH OF DIALOGUES WHERE UH ALL FOUR PARTICIPANTS ARE NON NATIVE
AND THERE'S ESPECIALLY ONE THERE THAT UM I THINK HE'S EASTERN EUROPEAN AND I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING AT ALL
BECAUSE I'M EASTERN EUROPEAN AND UH BUT IF WE WOULD JUST PLAY IT I THINK TO A RECOGNIZER
THEN WHAT HE SAYS YOU KNOW THE WAY HE REALISES WORDS SOUNDS NOTHING AT ALL LIKE IT IT SHOULD BE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO IT'S LESS OF A S IT'S LESS OF A STRESS
IT'S REALLY LIKE UH HIS UH I DON'T KNOW JUST THE PHONEMES SOUNDING DIFFERENTLY
WELL YOU CAN'T REALLY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ALL OF IT
OH
YEAH
OH I THINK I'VE TRANSCRIBED HIM AND I HAD PROJECT AT ALL UM EVOLUTION CRITERIA
YEAH
MM
OKAY
YEAH
AND ONE GUY WHO WAS SAYING EVOLUTION EACH TIME HE MEANT EVALUATION AND IT TOOK ME A WHOLE DIALOGUE YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING I WOULD ALWAYS TRANSCRIBE IT YOU KNOW FOR LACK OF BETTER KNOWLEDGE OR LACK OF CONTEXT
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DIALOGUE IT DAWNED ON ME THAT HE ACTUALLY MEANT EVALUATION
AND THEN I WENT BACK AND REPLACED I REPLACED IT IN THE WHOLE TRANSCRIPTION
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BASICALLY TH I THINK JUST DO YOUR BEST AND HOPE FOR THE BEST
WELL WE HAVE BOTH HEAD SET AND LAPEL TRANSCRIPTION
SO IT'S NOT TOO BAD
YEAH LET'S HAVE MAARIKA TRANSCRIBE THAT
MM-HMM
UM SORRY I'M JUST SEEING THIS WITH THE T. V. THERE IS T. UNDERSCORE V. UNDERSCORE
I THOUGHT WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO USE THE UNDERSCORE BETWEEN LETTERS
NO
OKAY SORRY THEN I'VE DONE IT WRONG SO FAR
OKAY
BUT IT IS A BACK TRACK
YEAH I THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW NOT EVEN MAYBE TO WELL
IF I TH IF YOU THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF A SYNTACTIC TREE
IT N DOESN'T HAVE TO GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE S. NODE
BUT IT JUST M IT MIGHT GO BACK TO THE LAST NODE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
WELL IT'S JUST MY WAY OF OF KNOWING IF IT W SORRY 'CAUSE LINGUISTICS IS ALL I'VE EVER KNOWN
MM-HMM
YEAH
WHERE
OH ET CETERA
IS IT ONE WORD OR IS IT TWO WORDS
OKAY
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE ET ALII
BUT IN SH IT ISN'T IT IN LATIN LIKE ET CETERA LIKE ET ALII OR
NO NO NO LIKE ET W YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE UH WHEN YOU HAVE A CITATION AND YOU SAY ET AL IT MEANS AND OTHERS
ET ET AL ET ALII IS THE FULL WORD AND ET CETERA MEANS AND FOLLOWING
SO
YEAH
OH IN IT IS OKAY YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
I THINK
YEAH
I THINK I IF SOMEBODY COULD WRITE I DON'T KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE IN PRACTICE TO WRITE A SCRIPT THAT WOULD IGNORE UM ALL THE WORD FRAGMENTS
ANYTHING WITH A HYPHEN
THEN A SPELL CHECK MIGHT MAKE MAKE SENSE
BUT UH TO JUST USE SIMPLE EMACS IT WILL UH BASICALLY MARK UM ALL THE WORD FRAGMENTS FOR YOU AND UH YOU KNOW
AND I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE AT SOME POINT YOU ALSO GET NEGLIGENT
YOU JUST CLICK OKAY OKAY OKAY YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT A MISTAKE AND THEN YOU MIGHT MISS A REAL ERROR
SO IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT SEE IS A ACTUAL FULL WORD SHOULDN'T IT THERE B SHOULDN'T THERE BE A SPACE BETWEEN SEE AND THE HYPHEN
YOU KNOW NOT TO BE NOT TO BE PEDANTIC
AFTER THE NO THE THE C. AND THE HYPHEN SHOULDN'T THERE BE A SPACE
OKAY
YEAH
UM THE WOULD AND W
NO
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE SAYING WILL OR WOULD
YEAH HE IT IT'S HIS YEAH
BUT IF IF IT'S NOT CLEAR DO I JUST PICK UH DO YOU JUST PICK THE MORE GRAMMATIC ALTERNATIVE
OR
B YEAH
BUT IF IT BUT IF IT'S REALLY NOT ABSOLUTELY NOT CLEAR
WHEN THEY SAY INSTEA YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY SWALLOW UP THE THE LAST BIT
OR DO WE JUST THEN TRANSCRIBE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
THE UM SHOULD BE CAPITALISED
YEAH
OKAY
OH OKAY
NO
YEAH
YEAH
UM OKAY SO WHAT ABOUT IF A WHOLE UTTERANCE IS UTTERED WHILE LAUGHING
DO YOU PUT THE LAUGHTER IN FRONT
OR IN WHAT I USU WHEN THAT HAPPENS WHAT I DO IS I PUT LAUGHTER IN FRONT
THEN THE WHOLE SENTENCE AND LAUGHTER IN YOU KNOW AT THE END AS WELL
SO
YEAH
NO BUT IT'S IT'S LAUGHTER TH THROUGHOUT
YEAH
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE LAUGHING THEMSELVES SILLY AT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHILE WHILE THEY SPEAK
MM-HMM
BECAUSE IN THE ICSI DIALOGUES UM THEY ALWAYS SAY YOU KNOW WHILE LAUGHING AND WE DON'T DO THAT
SO THEY SAY EITHER SO THERE IT'S REALLY NOT AMBIGUOUS WHETHER IT'S JUST LAUGH FOLLOWED BY AN A NORMALLY SPOKEN UTTERANCE OR WHETHER IT'S AN UTTERANCE SPOKEN WHILE LAUGHING
I THINK THERE IS A DISTINCTION THERE AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT
YEAH
'KAY
MORSE CODE
MORSE
YEAH
BUT THEN I W BUT THEN I WOULDN'T PUT AN ASTERISK ON IT
I THOUGHT ASTERISK IS SOMETHING WHERE UM IT'S C IT'S PRONOUNCED AS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORD LIKE EVALUATION AND EVOLUTION
NO
OKAY
OH
YEAH CAUSE I THIS IS A VERY FREQUENT MISTAKE THAT NO NATIVE SPEAKERS MAKE TO SAY CIRCUIT INSTEAD OF CIRCUIT
MM
MM
IS PUSH BUTTONS TWO WORDS
I USED ONE WORD
OKAY
WELL IT COULD BE SHE WOULD OR SHOULD AS WELL
YEAH
MM
I HAVEN'T EITHER
IT'S JUST TOO SILLY
I'M JUST THINKING OF UH YOU KNOW AN UTTERANCE CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF LAUGHTER AND THEN PUTTING LIKE PUNCTUATION IN LIKE
SORRY
YEAH BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS REALLY JUST SILENCE AND YOU'RE ASKING THE PERSON TO JUST GET RID OF
YEAH
MM
YEAH
OH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
JUST TO MAKE SENSE OF A SENTENCE
WHAT DOES CUTEST SPELLING MEAN
OH OKAY
OKAY
OH
WELL IF YOU WERE COCKNEY THEN SORRY
A. OR
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH WITH SOME PEOPLE IT ACTUALLY LEADS TO SOME REALLY SCREECHING NOISES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO LOUD OR PROBABLY THE MIC IS SO CLOSE
I HAD THIS ONE UM IN ONE OF THE FIRST DIALOGUES I DID THE G THIS GUY CALLED ED
YOU COULD UH ALWAYS SEE THE WAVEFORM ACTUALLY YOU KNOW
BEING JUST HITTING UM THE B THE BOUNDARIES ON ON BOTH ENDS AND JUST BEING AT SOME POINTS JUST BLACK SEGMENTS
AND WHEN HE WAS TALKING THERE WAS THIS WHOLE LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SPEAK TO CLOSE TO A MICROPHONE AND THAT WAS REALLY HORRIBLE
THE REST
HMM
MISTER ED
OH I HAD ONE GUY ONE OF THE PROJECT MANAGERS WAS UM HE HAD A REALLY WEIRD ACCENT AND HE WAS CALLING UM ONE GUY MISTER ED

MI U. S. MI MISSUS THE MISSUS
WHAT IF SOMEBODY CALLS THEMSELVES MS
I MEAN IT'S NOT NOT THAT IT EVER HAPPENED BUT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH

YEAH 'CAUSE I HAVE THERE IS ONE DIALOGUE WHERE I THINK TWO SPEAKERS ARE FRENCH LIKE ONE IS DEFINITELY FRENCH
AND I KNOW SHE IS SAYING AND THEN SOMEBODY S SAYING SOMETHING TO HER AND SHE GOES COMMENT AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THAT SO YEAH
OH NOT REALLY BUT ON COMMENT YEAH

THEN YOU CAN ALSO WAIT

WHEN YOU GET LIKE UM SOMEONE'S TALKING AND THERE'S THEY SORT OF PAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE THAT'S LONG ENOUGH FOR IT TO PUT A BREAK IN

YEP
IF WANT
OKAY
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
PHEW
OH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OH
WOW
OKAY
OH YEAH
ABSOLUTELY
ALRIGHT IS IT IT'S READY
OKAY GREAT
YEAH EVERYTHING'S OKAY
OKAY
OKAY OKAY YEAH
OKAY THANKS
OKAY
OKAY THANKS
YEAH
YEAH YEAH A VERY OR A QUICK UH SLIDES
SO UM I'VE BEEN HERE FOR FOURTEEN MONTH I THINK
YEAH SO I'VE A ACCUSTOMED TO THE ENVIRONMENT HERE AND ENJOY STAYING HERE
SO MM UH
FROM UH LAST YEAR I WAS UH UH S UH SUPERVISING THE ANNOTATION OF SEGMENTATION
SUMMARISATION UH UH WITH JEAN UH OF THE I UH IC ICSI CORPUS AND UH UH UH ON THE OTHER HAND UH I W N UH DID S SOME VERY PRELIMINARY WORK ON CHUNKING THE SWITCHBOARD CORPUS
BUT UH THAT WAS NOT UH WELL PICKED UP IN THE AMI CORPUS WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE
SO UH AND CURRENTLY I'M MORE INTERESTED IN SEE UH UH YEAH ANALYSING THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO PRESENT HERE
SO UH
UH IN THIS PRESENTATION I'M GOING TO SEE HOW WE COULD ANALYSE UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE RELATIONS IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
UM
'CAUSE MEETINGS IS A LIT DIFFERENT FROM NORMAL TEXT OR A N A NORMAL DIALOGUE OR MONOLOGUE
SO INTERACTIVITY IS A CONCEPT IS A CONCEPT THAT I'M USING TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO UH UH EXTREMES OF UH OF INTERAC UH OF DISCOURSE IN MEETINGS
AND UH FOR DIALOGUES UH AND MONOLOGUES I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO USE DIFFERENT UH CONCEPTS TO M M UH MODEL THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE
THEN UH I W I WILL UH GIVE A VERY UH ROUGH PLAN FOR THE NEXT UH COUPLE OF MONTH
AND FINALLY I I WILL INTR I INTRODUCE SOME RELATED WORK YEAH
SO
THE BIG QUESTION THAT I'M CONCERN HERE IS WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UTTERANCES IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
OR HOW DO WE ANALYSE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE RIGHT ABOVE UTTERANCES INSTEAD OF UH THOSE HIGH LEVEL INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE OF DISCOURSE
SO THE CONCERN HERE IS ABOUT THE VERY LOCAL LOW LEVEL UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE RELATIONS IN MULTI PARTY MEETINGS
UH THIS IS THE LOCAL DISCOURSE STRUCTURE
SO THE UH BUILDING BLOCK OF THAT KIND OF UH STRUCTURE WOULD BE THE UH UTTERANCE AND POSSIBLY ONE OF ITS PROPERTIES
THE DIALOGUE ACT WHICH WE'RE CURRENTLY UH WORKING ON OR UH AND UH FOR MEETINGS
YEAH SO I'VE MENTIONED UH UH BEFORE THAT MEETINGS IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM UH MONOLOGUE AND UH DIALOGUES
SO UH IN MEETINGS I UH FROM MY UH READING OF THE ONE OF THE AMI MEETINGS I. S. ONE O. EIGHT UH THE UH THE FOUR MEETINGS
I NOTICED THAT UH UH THE INTERACTION DEGREES OF INTERACTION IN THE MEETINGS UH VARIES FROM PARTS TO PARTS
SO FOR SOME PART UH THE INTERACTION IS VERY STRONG
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A DIALOGUE
BUT UH FOR SOME PART PART WHERE THE INTERACTION IS VERY WEAK UH JUST UH LIKE THE UH CHAIRMAN OR PROJECT MANAGER IS MM
UH COORDINATING THE MEETING
HE'S UH PUSHING THE MEETING FORWARD THEN THIS KIND OF S ORGAN ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OR PART
UH UH AND ALSO OTHER PR UH PARTS LIKE UH THE BACK CHANNELS WITHOUT ANY UH SEMANTIC CONTENT UH FROM OTHER PARTICIPANTS
SO THIS KIND OF UH INTERACTION MIGHT BE BETTER ANALYSED AS MONOLOGUE WHICH UH IN WHICH THERE IS INTERACTION I SUPPOSE
SO
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
SO YEAH SO THIS IS GOING TO BE BASED ON THE UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE
SO FOR THIS UTTERANCE THE NEXT UTTERANCE IF IT'S FROM ANOTHER PA UH SPEAKER
THEN UH IF IT'S NOT A BACK CHANNEL OR UH SOMETHING SIMILAR THEN IT'S A DIALOGUE
SO IF SPEAK CHANGES
SO YEAH SPEAKER CHANGE IS
YEAH
YEAH YEAH B BUT UH SH SHORT UH TURNS UH LIKE MM OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR MIGHT BE THE UH SEG SECOND TYPE OF INTERACTIVITY
THE WEAK INTERACTIVITY
THAT MIGHT NOT BE ANALYSED AS A UH MONOLOGUE BUT AS A DIAL UH NO NO NO WRONG UH NOT AS DIALOGUE BUT AS UM A MONOLOGUE
YEAH
SO FOR THAT PART UH FOR THAT KIND OF BACK CHANNELS WE CAN JUST SKIP THAT AND UH UH TO NOT TREAT THEM AS INTERRUPTIONS OR SOMETHING LIKE
THEN YEAH WE COULD JUST UH
YEAH
YEAH
SPEAK CHANGE SPEAK CHANGE WOULD BE YEAH
IF IF IT'S UH JUST SOME KIND OF BACK CHANNEL OR IT'S JUST A SIGNAL SIGNAL THE S THE SPEAKER IS LISTENING OR IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
UM
YEAH SO
UH YEAH
UH SO FOR INTERACTIVITY THIS IS THE ONLY SLIDE
SO YEAH ACTIVITY IS UH I'D DEFINE INTERACTIVITY TO BE AS A DEGREES OF INTERACTION IN MEETINGS
SO WHICH MIGHT UH SPEAK CHANGE WHI UH UH WOULD BE A VERY GOOD INDICATOR YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH YEAH
NO NO
YEAH
NO YEAH
SO ACTUALLY SO UH THIS IS A VERY ROUGH IDEA OF INTERACTIVITY
IF WE GO FURTHER WE MIGHT DISTINGUISH UH THE INTERACTIVITY BETWEEN TWO F THREE OR ALL THE GROUPS
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME FINAL DEFINITION FOR THE UH INTERACTIVITY YEAH
YEAH SO THAT MIGHT BE THE SECOND CLASS YEAH
WEAK THIS IS A KIND OF WEAK INTERACTIVITY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S ALSO TRUE
YEAH
S YEAH YEAH ACTUALLY 'CAUSE UH I'VE LOOKED UH
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO FOR THAT CASE YEAH UH YEAH SO THIS MIGHT BE A WEAK DEFINITION OF INTERACTIVITY
SO IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT UH IF THEY ARE REALLY INTERACTI UH INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER OR JUST UH UH INCREMENTAL MM PRESENTATION OF SOME INFORMATION
SO THAT'S D UH DIFFERENT
WE MIGHT UM YEAH NEED A MORE STRICT OR FINER UH DEFINITION OF INTERACTIVITY
YEAH JU UH FOR THIS USE OF THE UH FOR THE USE OF THIS TERM FOR THE INDICATOR OF THE UH DEGREES OF INTERACTION
UH I THINK FOR FOR THE CURRENT UH PROPOSAL I THINK THAT IT'S JUST FOR DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIALOGUES AND MONOLOGUES
'CAUSE FOR THESE TWO TYPES OF DISCOURSE UH THE UH
THE THE CONS THE THE TWO THAT WE ARE GOING TO ANALYSE THE DISCOURSE STRUCTURE MIGHT BE D DIFFERENT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
AND ALSO 'CAUSE UH I HAVE UH READ SOME OF THE M. O. T. A. UH CORPUS
UH SO FOR SOME PART OF TH THAT KIND OF MEETINGS UM UH SEVERAL UTTERANCES OR DIALOGUE ACTS ARE JUST UH TAGGED AS STATEMENT
SO THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY INFORMATIVE FOR HIGH LEVEL STR ANALYSIS
SO THAT'S ALL WHAT UH THAT'S WHY WHY UH I'M DISTINGUISHING THE TWO KINDS OF DISCOURSE HERE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH THE LIKE YEAH
YESTERDAY YEAH
MM-HMM
MIGHT BE A
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
NO JUST A UH TURN EXCHANGE YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
ACTUALLY SH UH SHE USED SOME A A A BUNCH OF FEATURES TO DO THE AUTOMATIC PARSING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH YEAH
UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE YEAH
VERY LOW LEVEL YEAH
YOU COU YEAH
YEAH I TO UH JUST WE NEED TO SEE UH HOW WELL WE COULD WORK OUT OF THE UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE
YEAH
YEAH
SO UH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO
HMM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO YEAH FOR INTERACTIVITY THIS IS A VERY WEAK DEFINITION YEAH
IF WE NEED MORE THEN WE MIGHT USE SOME MORE FINER UH F FINER UH DEFINITION FOR INTERACTIVITY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY
SO MM SO FOR DIALOGUE YEAH MM THERE WOULD BE UH SOME KIND OF UH INTERACTION STRUCTURE
SO IT FOR UH IN PREVIOUS DISCOURSE STUDIES UH ESPECIALLY IN DISCOURSE ANALYSIS EXCHANGE UH IS USED TO DESCRIBE THIS KIND OF UH LOCAL STRUCTURE
AND IN CONVERSATION THE ANALYSIS SO ADJACENCY PAIRS ARE USED TO DESCRIBE THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE
UH
BUT UH IN THESE TWO STRANDS OR WORK THEY UH JUST COME UP WITH A LIST MAYBE NOT UH EXHAUSTIVE
SO UH I'M BEEN THINK ABOUT UH IF WE COULD COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF MORE PRINCIPAL SCHEME UH TAKING SOME OF THE UH INFORMATION IN THE UH UH UH IN THE UH INTERACTION UH INTO ACCOUNT
LIKE UH IS THE SMALL PART OF INTERACTION IS IS EXCHANGING SOME INFORMATION
UH HERE INFORMATION IS A LITTLE VAGUE
IT COULD BE SOME KIND OF KNOWLEDGE WHAT THE UH SPEAKER KNOWS OR OR SOME KIND OF THOUGHT WHAT THE SPEAKER IS THINKING
SO THESE TWO KIND OF UH INFORM MM TWO KINDS OF THE INFORMATION UH MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF A DIFFERENCE
SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE BELL'S MM EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION UH FOR THE KNOWLEDGE
IF EXCHANGE OF UH OPINION UH UH SOME KIND OF SO IT'S UH VERY RELATED TO THOUGHT OF THINKING YEAH
UH IN SOME CASE IT S DIFFERS 'CAUSE UH WHEN WE EXCHANGE KNOWLEDGE WE MIGHT NOT CHALLENGE UH THE SPEAKER
BUT UH WHEN THE SPEAKER IS UH PRE UH IS UH TALK ABOUT WHAT HE FEELS WHAT HE THINKS
IS PROPOSING SOMETHING OR S UH THEN OTHER SPEAKERS MIGHT MIGHT CHAN CHALLENGE HIM OR HER
SO THAT KIND OF STRUCTU
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT UH THAT MIGHT B BE SOME DIFFERENCE INTER INTERACTION PAR PATTERNS
MIGHT BE
'CAUSE UH FOR INFORMATION IF WE UH SOMEBODY'S UH SEEKING SOME INFORMATION THEN HE UH ASK SOME QUESTION AND UH THE ONE KNOWS WILL UH GIVES GIVES THE ANSWER
BUT UH UH FOR THE UH OPINION OR THOUGHT UH STUFF
THEN THE SPEAKER MIGHT JUST UH UH PRESENT SOME IDEA AND OTHERS WILL COMMENT OR UH CHALLENGE UH THE IDEA
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH IT'S VAGUE YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM SEE 'CAUSE UH SO FAR I'M S STILL LOOKING FOR A UH SO CALLED PRINCIPAL SCHEME FOR THE INTERACTION UH FOR THE INTERACTION
SO
YEAH SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO YEAH FOR UH P UH THE DISCOURSE ANALYSIS THEY'RE USING EXCHANGE
BUT UH THEY HAVE NO UH NO CLASSIFICATION JUST TO COME UP WITH OKAY SO UH YOU MEAN UH
UH SINCLAIR AND COULTHARD
THAT IS
ALSO AT GENEVA SCHOOL THEY I DON'T THINK THEY LIST SOME KIND OF EXCHANGE
BUT UH THE UH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE UH AND UH YEAH EXCHANGE IS FIRST UH DEVELOPED IN UH SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR ALONG THE UH UH HALLIDAY AND AND MARTIN'S WORK
YEAH
SO UH ACTUALLY THEY THEY HAVE SOME SOMETHING IN IN A TEXTBOOK ABOUT THE EXCHANGE
UH THEY CALL IT NEGOTIATION
SO THEY HAVE UH SOME FLOW CHARTS OF THE UH UH DETAILED ANALYSIS OF UH UH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE YEAH
YEAH
SO UM UH I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY KIND OF PRINCIPLE CLASSIFICATION OF EXCHANGES
THIS IS I YEAH W
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM
YEAH I. R. F. UH KIND OF STRUCTURE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
OKAY
MM 'CAUSE UH FROM MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WE SEE ANANYS ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION SEEKING DIALOGUES OVER TELEPHONES
SO IT'S UM UH ABOUT THE TOURISM INFORMATION
SO FROM UH UM MY ANALYSIS OF THAT KIND OF DIALOGUES I COULD SAY THAT THERE'S ONLY THERE ONLY FOUR BASIC UH EXCHANGES DEPEND ON THE INFORMATION UH DIRECTION OF THE INFORMATION FLOW
AND ALSO THE SPEAKER ROLE
'CAUSE IN THE INFORMATION SEEKING DIALOGUES THE UH T ROLES OF THE TWO PARTICIPANTS ARE DIFFERENT
ONE IS MAINLY THE UH FROM THE UH AGENCY A TOURISM AGENCY
THAT IS MAIN UH UH INFORMATION PROVIDER UH WHILE THE CUSTOMER IS THE INFORMATION SEEKER MAINLY
YEAH THAT'S UH SO THEREF UH AND ALSO MM UH THE DIRECTION OF INFORMATION FLOWS FOR SOME KIND OF INFORMATION
LIKE UH THE UH UH PRICE OF A SPECIFIC ROUTE
UH THE SPOTS THEY'RE GOING TO UH VISIT AND ALSO ON THE UH KINDS OF UH VE UH VEHICLE OR OR TRANSPORTATION YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH S YEAH YEAH
SO BUT THERE ALSO SOME VARIATIONS WHICH I CALL COMPLEX EXCHANGES
SO THAT'S UH THAT'S UH JUST A LIST
MM NOT LIKE THE UH BASIC EXCHANGE UH EXCHANGES YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH PARAMETRI YEAH I I I'M LOOKING FOR PARAMETRIC YEAH SCHEME
YEAH YEAH YEAH
THAT'S UH Y YEAH
A PARAME PARAMETER OR PRINCIPLE
YEAH SOME SOMETHING LIKE
YEAH
YEAH
AND ALSO YEAH
A AND ALSO S IN 'CAUSE IN THE MEETINGS UH THE SPEAKERS MIGHT MIGHT REPORT SOMETHING UH THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND UH UH UH UH TALK ABOUT TH WHAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING AND ALSO PLANNING SOME FUTURE ACTIONS
SO THIS KIND OF INFORMATION MIGHT ALSO BE HELPFUL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH NOT MARKING
JUST UH FOR MY UH READING OF THE UH I. I. S. ONE O. EIGHT UH FOUR MEETING SERIES
YEAH JUST TO READING THIS PART YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
SO THIS IS FOR THE UH DIALOGUE PART
FOR MONOLOGUES UH THIS IS UH YEAH
OKAY SO NO FURTHER UH INFORMATION IS HERE
UH
UH
MM 'CAUSE UH SO FOR THE INFORMATION AND ACTION THE UH THE ACTION HERE IS NOT DIALOGUE ACT BUT UH SOME KIND OF UH UH PHYSICAL ACTION UH THAT UH THE UH PARTICIPANT'S UH I I IS GOING TO UH OR HAS DONE IN THE PAST
HE'S GOING TO DO THE FUTURE
SO
UH NOT
PHYSICAL SENSE YEAH
PHYSICAL SENSE YEAH
YEAH SO UH THIS KIND OF MIGHT BE THE UH SOME KIND OF SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCE OR OR EXCHANGE
SO UH THIS IS JUST ONE UM THING I ONE PARAMETER UH FOR MM-HMM
UH
I MEAN UH HERE THE SCHEME IS FOR EXCHANGE SCHEME
SO YEAH FOR UH FOR FOR UH EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
SO THERE MIGHT BE THE UH S SPEAKER AND HE UH A HEARER
SO WHO SPEAKS TO WHOM AND UH UH
S SO THIS IS THE UH UH SO DIRECTION OF THE INFORMATION FLOW AND ALSO SO SPEAKER ROLE MIGHT BE FIRST UH PARAMETERS FOR THE UH EX UH INFORMATION EXCHANGES
SO UM BUT FOR ACTION THAT MIGHT BE UH SOME KIND OF UH PROPOSE OR ACCEPT OR REJECT KIND OF UH UH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE I MEAN
UH-HUH
UH NO NO
NO THAT'S UH THAT'S THE UH
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING AND UH UH SO COULD YOU DO SOMETHING OR THIS KIND OF UH ACTION RELATED UTTERANCE I MEAN
YEAH
OKAY TECHNICAL SENSE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
OKAY YEAH YEAH
OKAY YEAH THAT'S N
HMM
BEFORE COME UP WITH THE SCHEME YOU MEAN
YEAH
EXCH
SO YEAH
UH YEAH
S STENT YEAH STENT MIGHT DOES UM YEAH
STENT YEAH
MM NO
UH SO SO 'CAUSE I'M I MIGHT NOT FAMILIAR WITH THESE NA
MM-HMM
SO UH IS IT THE WORK UH DESCRIBED IN THE C UH IN IN UH IN THE COCONUT PROJECT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
Y YEAH LOOK UH NOT VERY MUCH DETAIL YEAH
YEAH
NO NOT
OKAY
YEAH
YES YES
YEAH I KNOW OKAY
OH
UH I KNOW THIS GUY YEAH YEAH
UH JIM @'S STUDENT
YEAH I KNOW
NO NO IN SAA SAARBRUECKEN
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH I KNOW HER
OKAY
NO
MM-HMM
NO
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
SO MAIN ACTIONS I GUESS MIGHT BE SOME SOME HIGH LEVEL UH PROBLEM SOLVING OR DECISION MAKING UH UH CONCEPTS
UH NOT LIKE THE EXCHANGE WHICH WHICH I I WOULD LIKE TO BE VERY LOW LEVEL UTTERANCE TO UTTERANCE RELATIONS
UH I MEAN UH I MEAN THE M MAIN ACTIONS MIGHT BE SOME IT MIGHT BE YEAH BUILT BUILT
OKAY SO WELL W
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
PHYSICAL
SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIONS YEAH
OKAY
YEAH DIFFERENT SCHEME YEAH
SO YEAH UH TH THE THE MAIN ACTIONS THAT UH YOU'RE TALK ABOUT I THINK MIGHT BE YEAH BUILT UP FROM THE EXCHANGE YEAH
EX AT LEAST EXCHANGE MIGHT BE UH ONE KIND OF UH IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THAT KIND OF
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
NEXT
YEAH
SO YEAH FOR THE MONOLOGUE I'VE I HAVE NOT UH LOOKED INTO THE DETAILS ABOUT THE THIS KIND OF UH RELATIONS FOR THE MONOLOGUE PARTS
JUST A LIST OF THESE UH RELATIONS
AND UH SO UH NEXT I NEED TO UH REVIEW THE LITERATURE AND UH COME UP WITH S SCHEMES FOR THE REAL DATA ANNOTATION
AND AFTER THAT UH WE W 'CAUSE THIS MM IS NOT IN THE HUB CORPUS
SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET L ALL THE MEETINGS ANNOTATED WITH THAT KIND OF
SO UH SO WE WE MIGHT JU FIRST TRY A FEW MEETINGS AND UH HAVE A RELIABILITY STUDY
IF IT'S RELIABLE ENOUGH
THEN WE MUST JUST UH JUST ANNOTATE A SMALL PART OF THE MEETINGS AND USING SOME LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO BOOT BOOT STRAP THE UH UH AUTOMATIC UH ANALYSER
MM-HMM
YEAH IF UH IF IT'S BASED ON THE UH UM DIALOGUE ACTS YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
YES
HMM
OR FITS THE MEETING BROWSER
YEAH
OKAY SO MM
THIS MIGHT NOT BE
THE FINAL GOAL THAT UH THAT COULD BE FIT INTO THE UH BROWSER
BUT IT UH MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF UH UH INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT BENEFIT MEETING ACTIONS OR SOME MORE HIGH LEVEL DECISION MAKING OR PROBLEM SOLVING
'CAUSE THIS IS THE BUILDING BLOCKS I GUESS YEAH
SO
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
SO AFTER THIS IF UH IF UH UH WE MIGHT DO SOME MM PE UH FROM HERE WE MIGHT BE SOME UH UH
YEAH C PROBLEM SOLVING DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO TRACK THAT KIND OF INFORMATION
YEAH
YEAH
MESSY
YEAH YEAH
HMM
MM-HMM
YE YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH MA MA UH S
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S KIND OF UH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
DIFFERENT FEATURE COMBINATION YEAH
YEAH YES
UH UH YEAH
UH I MEAN I WAS SUPPOSED TO CHUNK UH SOME PART OF THE AMI MEETINGS
YOU KNOW TO SEE IF THE CHUNKER CHANNEL SWITCHBOARD WORKS WELL ENOUGH OR NOT
IF NOT THEN MM WE HAVE TO USE SOME KIND OF SEMI SUPERV SUPERVISED LEARNING OR SOME UH BOOT STRAPPING TO TO TO DO THE CHUNKING
NO NO 'CAUSE I WAS A BIT WORRIED ABOUT UH THIS KIND OF UH DISCOURSE STRUCTURE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UH DIALOGUE SEGMENTATON
YEAH OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OR AMI DATA
N NO
OKAY
SO
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
YEAH YEAH FOR SWITCHBOARD YEAH
DIRECT CHUNKING 'CAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO IN A TREE OUT OF THE AMI DATA
UH SO TH UH WE UH D. F. K. I. 'CAUSE THEY'RE WORKING ON SOME H. P. S. G. PARSING
YEAH MIGHT BE
MIGHT BE YEAH
IF THE
UH IF UH I'M I GUESS THAT IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEN WE MIGHT JUST UH WRITE ANOTHER SCRIPT TO DO THE TRANSLATION
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
I NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF TO SEE
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
TWENTY MINUTE YEAH
YEAH
T. N. O. YEAH
OKAY
YEAH 'CAUSE YEAH THEY DID SOME WORK BIO PROJECT WITH THE H. P. S. G. PARSING
AT LEAST BIO
YEAH WELL MAYBE
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO
OKAY OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH NOT SURE C UH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
HMM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
'KAY
YEAH YEAH
HMM
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
S SO THEN LATER YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH IT'S YEAH
OKAY
SORRY
YOU MEAN MM
I WILL TRY MY BEST YEAH
OH YEAH
UH I M I MIGHT YEAH 'CAUSE UH JULIE AND THE BOY IS HERE
SO
IT'S A LITTLE TIRING 'CAUSE MY PARENTS HAVE LEFT
UH YEAH
SO I MIGHT TAKE TWO WEEKS OFF TWO WEEKS OFF IN UH MAY YEAH SOMETIMES YEAH
OFF YEAH
OKAY THANKS
UH YEAH HOPE I HOPE SO VERY SOON
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY THANKS
FIVE YEARS JUST BECAUSE OF THE FLOODS BRINGING THE CEILINGS DOWN
SO ON ITS GREAT JOY
I THINK THEY PROBABLY OUGHT TO BUT UH THEY WELL
THEY'VE ONLY JUST STARTED REALISING THAT TREATING THIS AS A LEGAL ISSUE IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT WAY TO LOOK AT IT
SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UP FOR UNDERSTANDING UM THE INTRICACIES OF THE COMMITTEE I GUESS
I MEAN I YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY COULD BUT IT'S R IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE HARD WORK
THE LAW ISN'T VERY CLEAR
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
THEY P THEY UH THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO
IT'S JUST IT'S SO STRAPPED NOW UM YOU KNOW
LIKE THE CITIZENS ADVICE BUREAU IS SO HARD TO ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO BECAUSE THEY'VE THEY HAVE SO MANY CASES AND SO FEW PEOPLE
SO BUT YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY THE NEXT THING THEY'LL HAVE TO DO
M
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT
WELL UM I THOUGHT THE RIGHT THING TO DO WAS TO REVIEW WHAT WEI XUN'S BEEN DOING IN THE AREA OF DIALOGUE STRUCTURE FOR WORK PACKAGE ONE OVER THE LAST PERIOD
SO BASICALLY FOR HIM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HE WHAT PROGRESS HE'S BEEN MAKING AND THEN FOR US TO UM FOR HI FOR HIM TO DESCRIBE WHAT WORK HE INTENDS OVER THE NEXT PERIOD OF THE PROJECT
AND FOR US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HELP HE NEEDS WITH THAT
UM M MAYBE GIVE HIM SOME HELP FIGURING OUT WHAT PUBLICATIONS HE'S GONNA UM GET OUT OF THIS AND FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT IT FITS INTO THE OVERALL PROJECT
SO UM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA DO EVERYTHING TODAY
BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SORT OF ALL ALIGNED ON WHAT HE WAS DOING AT THE MOMENT AND AND THEN SORT OF FIGURED OUT HOW TO GIVE HIM THE BEST ADVICE COMING UP
SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY I CALLED THIS
I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED
SO UM WHEN YOU SAY INTERACTIVITY DO YOU MEAN UM WELL HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERISE A HIGHLY INTERACTIVE MEETING
WHAT ARE THE MEASUREMENTS YOU'D APPLY
SO YOU I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SEGMENTING MEETINGS INTO HIGHLY INTERACTIVE PARTS AND NOT SO INTERACTIVE PARTS
WHERE YOU THINK SOME OF THEM ARE LIKE A BIT LIKE DIALOGUE AND SOME ARE A BIT LIKE MONOLOGUE
SO WHAT MEASUREMENTS WOULD YOU APPLY TO UM FIND OUT WHICH IS WHICH
SO YOU MEAN RELATIVELY SHORT TURNS AND SPEAKER CHANGE
S
SO SO AM I RIGHT IN THINKING YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN SEGMENT MEETINGS MAYBE INTO TWO T TYPES OF AREAS INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE
SO WHAT ARE TH WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTERACTIVE AREAS
SO W SO OKAY SO BUT YOU JUST SAID I THINK THAT YOU WOULD CHARACTERISE SHORT TURNS AS BEING THE NON INTERACTIVE PARTS
OH OKAY WELL WE WE CAN DISCOUNT BACK CHANNELS
I MEAN UH C ARE YOU IS IT OKAY IF WE TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE 'CAUSE I'M CONFUSED
OR OR DO YOU GET A C
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
'CAUSE IF THIS IS ALL WE'VE GOT
I THINK WE SHOULD UH HAVE INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE ON THE BOARD AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT PROPERTIES GOING TO EACH JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR WHAT THE TWO MEAN
UH
WELL UH OKAY
BUT ARE YOU YOU NEED TO BE MORE PRECISE WHAT YOU MEAN BY SPEAKER CHANGE
SO Y DO YOU MEAN ALL OF THE SPEAKERS ARE INVOLVED IN IT
IS IT SUFFICIENT FOR TWO SPEAKERS
RIGHT AND THEN
OKAY BUT THAT'S N YOU CAN THAT'S DEFINITIONAL RIGHT
SO SO I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY CONSIDER THAT TO CHANGE THE TURNS
THOSE ARE JUST BACK CHANNELS
SO ONE SPEAKER WILL HAVE THE FLOOR CHANNEL UM THROUGHOUT THAT AND SO I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE INTERACTIVE SECTIONS WOULD HAVE SHORTER SPEAKER TURNS WHEN YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING THE BACK CHANNELS AS INTERRUPTIONS
UM SO
WELL DO Y
YEAH
SUFFICIENT BUT NOT NECESSARY MAYBE
IT DEPEND IF YOU HAD SO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ALL JUST GIVING INFORMATION AND OPINION AROUND THE TABLE AND THEY NEVER ACTUALLY ASK QUESTIONS OF EACH OTHER
BUT THE TURNS WERE ACTUALLY QUITE SHORT WHICH ONE WOULD IT BE
MM-HMM
RIGHT OKAY
I REMEMBER YOU SAYING THIS BEFORE
SO BASICALLY YOU WANT TO DO THE SEGMENTATION BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANALYSES TO THE TWO SECTIONS
UM
RIGHT
SO WEI XUN QUITE TAKES QUITE A STRONG POSITION ON UM THIS UM DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO UM KINDS OF GROUP ACTIVITIES BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT THEY ADMIT DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANALYSES
RIGHT THE WITH THE NON INTERACTIVE MORE MONOLO MONO LOGIC SECTIONS OF THE MEETING UM YOU HAVE TO UH ANALYSE THEM USING SOMETHING AKIN TO RHETORICAL STRUCTURE OR SOMETHING
AND UH WITH THE OTHER SECTIONS YOU UH UM YOU YOU USE SOME OTHER THEORY TO LOOK AT THEM
AND I ACTUALLY UH THINK THAT THAT'S A SLIGHTLY EXTREME UM POSITION UM WITH REGARD TO THE LITERATURE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHO THE DIFFERENT SPEAKERS ARE IN AN INTERACTIVE SECTION
YOU CAN STILL UM BUILD MAYBE THE THE SAME ARGUMENT STRUCTURE OVER THE TOP OF THE BASIC UM ACTS AND PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT THAT'S THERE
AND UH WHAT YOU GET IS A MESSIER VERSION OF THE ARGUMENT STRUCTURE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME ARGUMENT IN THEIR BRAIN YOU KNOW FOR THIS
BUT UM BUT THAT THE SAME THEORY OR THE THE SAME ANALYSIS CAN BE APPLIED TO BOTH PARTS
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP UM THAT IN MIND
AND IF YOU IF YOU DO NEED TO ARGUE THAT THESE TWO KINDS OF GROUP ACTIVITIES UH CAN CAN ONLY BE ANALYSED IF YOU USE DIFFERENT ANALYTICAL MECHANISMS
THEN YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS
RIGHT SO IT IT PUTS AN EXTRA BURDEN OF PROOF ON THE WORK THAT YOU DO
MM
RIGHT
BUT TO THE GROU DEGREE THAT A GROUP IS BUILDING AN ARGUMENT TOGETHER
I MEAN IT I THINK WH WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN A GROUP DISCUSSION ISN'T NECESSARILY ONE COHERENT ARGUMENT F FOR THE PERSON
BUT AN ARGUMENT THAT IS THE GROUP VIEW
AND SO IT'S MAYBE IT'S NOT R. S. T. UM BUT IT'S UM MORE AKIN TO UM I DON'T KNOW IS IT TOOLMAN
BUT YOU KNOW NOT THAT I BUT YOU KNOW THE KINDS OF THINGS WHERE PEOPLE TO TRY TO REPRESENT ARGUMENT STRUCTURE
ARE ARE THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF IT FOR THIS ANALYSIS REALLY THAT SUBSTANTIVELY DIFFERENT THOUGH
BUT I IF SOMEBODY IF THERE'S BEEN AN ARGUMENT SO FAR IN A GROUP MEETING
AND UM SOMEBODY MAKES A STATEMENT THEY HAVE AN INTENTION ABOUT HOW TO MODIFY THAT GROUP ARGUMENT
RIGHT BUT BUT YOU'RE
OKAY SO THE R THE RELATION NAMES AREN'T AREN'T RIGHT BUT UM
RIGHT
OKAY
WELL THE RELATION NAMES ARE LESS IMPORTANT
I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED FOR AGES ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT RELATIONS WERE IN ANY OF THESE THEORIES
AND THAT'S THAT'S LESS IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE THEORY IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE
AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE TWO DIF SEPARATE APPARATUSES FOR THE UM SPEAKER INTERNAL UM ARGUMENT STRUCTURE AND THE GROUP ARGUMENT STRUCTURE
THAT THAT'S MORE APPARA APPARATUS THAN YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY NEED FOR UM FROM DOING THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS
'CAUSE IN BOTH CASES YOU'RE UM BUILDING UP AN ARGUMENT PUBLICLY IN THIS GROUP MEETING AND THEN YOU KNOW
ADDING SOMETHING OR CHANGING THE EXISTING ARGUMENT IN SOME WAY BY RELATING A CONTRIBUTION TO WHAT'S UM ALREADY ON THE TABLE
SO
MM
YEAH C I JUST THINK WELL I MEAN IT ALL OF THESE THINGS WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER A NEW GENRE OF UM OF UH ACTUAL DATA
THEN THEY END UP MODIFYING BUILDING NEW KINDS OF RELATIONS WITH NEW KINDS OF SEMANTICS AND ADDING THEM
THAT'S THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THESE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
SO THERE YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY WHO'S DOING THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD CLAIM THAT YOU DON'T NEED TWO SEPARATE AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS FOR THESE TWO TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT WEI XUN HAS IDENTIFIED
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
I JUST PREFER IT TO BE ONE THING RATHER THAN TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE THINGS AND THEN THE ADDED EXPLANATION OF WHY IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE SAME THING APPLIED TO BOTH HALVES
HMM YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH WHICH WOULDN'T PROBABLY WOULDN'T GIVE US THE KIND OF UM INFORMATION THAT WE NEED ABOUT RELATIONS ACROSS TURNS
JUST BECAUSE WE REALLY ARE CRITICALLY INTERESTED IN THE ARGUMENT UM THAT THE GROUP IS BUILDING UP SO THAT WE CAN FIND THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE AND UM ANY P UH COUNTER PROPOSALS TO PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND THINGS
I MEAN IT REALLY IS MORE IN THE SPIRIT UH OF THE R. S. T. ISH RELATIONS THAN UM THAN IN THE DAMSEL KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS
WHAT WE WANT UH OUT OF THE C UM THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPEAKERS HERE
THEY ARE JOINTLY BUILDING UP AN ARGUMENT STRUCTURE
AND THAT IS THE CRITICAL THING THAT WE'RE MISSING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO UM UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE MEETINGS
SO WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T WANNA DO THE SAME THING AS WHAT UM SHE DID IN THIS CASE
BEC JUST BECAUSE UM DAMSEL DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT SORT OF REPRESENTATION BETWEEN SPEAKERS
OH DOES IT
OKAY UM I HAVEN'T SEEN IT ON THAT THIS KIND OF DATA
SO MAYBE
RIGHT OKAY BUT ARE WHAT I MEAN IS YOU KNO WANNA MAKE SURE YOU GET THE ARGUMENTATIVE RELATIONS HOWEVER YOU DO IT
WHICHEVER RELATIONS YOU HAVE TO BUILD YOU KNOW
NOT I'M NOT SAYING I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR SET OF TAGS OR RELATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFINED OUT THERE THAT ARE THE RIGHT ONES
I'M JUST SAYING WE NEED THE CORRECT ONES FOR TH THE STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS
'CAUSE WE NEED CERTAIN INFORMATION OUT OF THIS ANALYSIS
THAT
YEAH
WELL WEI XUN'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE DATA
SO THAT'S THAT'S A STEP FOR THIS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM YEAH
WELL WHAT YOU'LL NEED IN THE END IS SOMETHING OPERATIONAL
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN USE TO ACTUALLY SEGMENT MEETINGS INTO THE UM THE AREAS THAT YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR THIS ANALYSIS RIGHT
SO UM IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR TO ME WHAT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS ARE
SO IT WOULD BE I THINK HANDY IF YOU COULD TAKE A MEETING AT SOME POINT AND SAY YOU KNOW
THIS IS A INTERACTIVE AREA AND THIS IS A MONO LOGIC AREA BECAUSE AND WE COULD COME UP WITH WHAT KINDS OF MEASUREMENTS YOU NEED
UM I MEAN WE HAVE W WE HAVEN'T DONE PAST WORK HERE ON SEGMENTING MEETINGS IN THAT WAY
BUT WE HAVE DONE WORK ON CHARACTERISING DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEETINGS UM IN TERMS OF HOW HIGHLY INTERACTIVE THEY ARE
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT DEFINITION RIGHT
IT'S IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE MEETING UM TAKE SOME TAKE EQUAL PART IN IT AS OPPOSED TO UM LIKE THE HIGHEST STATE IS PEOPLE IN THE MEETING JUST DRIVING IT AND AND UH THE OTHER PEOPLE FOLLOWING WHATEVER THE HIGH STATE IS PEOPLE WANT
SO UM BUT THOSE KINDS OF MEASURES UM YOU KNOW
WE COULD USE TO UM TO DO THIS KIND OF SEGMENTATION IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE ANALYSIS RIGHT
W BUT WE NEED CLEARER DEFINITIONS OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT THINGS ARE HOW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF OF UM ACTIVITIES ARE THERE
YOU KNOW IS IT JUST INTERACTIVE AND NON INTERACTIVE OR IS THERE ARE THERE THERE MORE GRADES OF SHADING THAN THAT
AND UM YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU EXPECT IN EACH
WHAT'S THE BACK CHANNELLING BEHAVIOUR
WHAT'S THE SPEAKER TURN UM YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF DIALOGUE ACTS DO YOU EXPECT
I THINK THAT WOULD HELP YOU PIN DOWN WHAT THE DEFINITIONS ARE
DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS WHETHER SOMETHING IS KNOWLEDGE OR OPINION IN THE WAY IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROUP PROCESS
YEAH
I I SORT OF HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN THE VIEW THAT UM THAT WELL PEOPLE AREN'T VERY GOOD AT AT THIS KIND OF RATIONALITY YOU KNOW
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION AND OPINION ISN'T THAT PROMINENT IN THE WAY PEOPLE DO THEIR REASONING
SO UM
YEAH
WELL YOU YOU CAN'T DEFINE 'EM THAT WAY
YOU CAN'T DEFINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION AND OPINION THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT'S UM BASICALLY DEFINING AS THE WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT IT
AND I THINK WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT UM IF PEOPLE CHALLENGE THE THE FACTS
YOU OFTEN DISCOVER THAT THEY WEREN'T ACTUALLY SOLID FACTS ANYWAY YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE I THINK THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THESE IS KIND OF FLUID
SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS IT IMPORTANT TO WHAT WHAT'S IT IMPORTANT TO
SO DO YOU NEED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFORMATION AND OPINION TO DO THIS ANALYSIS
SO WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING AT
SO YOU'RE YOU'VE GOT BOOKS THAT HIGH ON YOUR DESK
WHICH ONES ARE THEY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
SO Y UM I'M SORT OF GETTING THAT YOU THINK THERE IS A LACK IN THE UH THEORY TO DO WITH EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AT THE MOMENT
BUT I'M BUT I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR YET WHAT YOU THINK THE LACK IS
SO
UM THE WELL ARE YOU THINKING IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE READ THIS LITERATURE
BUT I MEAN MY UNDERSTANDING OF EXCHANGE IS IS THAT THE INITIATING MOVE INTRODUCES A GOAL TO THE DISCOURSE
AND THEN THE REMAINING MOVES UM WILL UH CONTRIBUTE TO EITHER THE UM THE MEETING OF THAT DISCOURSE GOAL OR THE DECISION NOT TO BOTHER WITH THAT DISCOURSE GOAL
RIGHT
AND SO UM I'D BE SURPRISED IF THERE WASN'T WORK DESCRIBING
THINGS IN THOSE TERMS
I MEAN I KNOW SINCLAIR AND COULTHARD IS IS BASICALLY ABOUT TEACHING YEAH
SO YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT TO NECESSARILY UM APPLY UH IN IN WIDER CONTACTS IN A WAY
LIKE YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO HAVE TO EXTEND THE THEORY TO DO THAT
BUT I TH I THINK THERE ARE OTHER OTHER PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AND DESCRIBED IT IN THESE TERMS IN A WAY THAT SHOULD REALLY SUIT YOUR NEEDS
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO THIS IS A L A LOT LIKE GEORGE HORTON'S WORK ON SAYING WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS FOR UM THESE EXCHANGES
YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT CHARACTERISE THE SET OF EXCHANGES THAT CAN HAPPEN
MM
SO SO IS YOUR COMPLAINT LESS ABOUT UM LESS ABOUT KNOWING WHAT MAKES AN EXCHANGE AND MORE ABOUT KNOWING HOW YOU PARAMETERISE EXCHANGES FOR THIS GENRE
SO WHAT'S THE RANGE
OKAY SO YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S THE RANGE OF EXCHANGE TYPES FOR THIS GENRE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK HASN'T BEEN DONE
UH-HUH
OKAY
THAT'S CLEARER
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO SO HAVE HAVE YOU TRIED I MEAN UM I KNOW OF ONE PREVIOUS ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH WHAT EXCHANGES ARE NEEDED FOR F UM SOME KINDS OF INDUSTRY MEETINGS
AND OUR EXPERIENCE IN THAT PROJECT WAS THAT UM YOU CAN'T REALLY IDENTIFY EXCHANGE STRUCTURES IN THESE MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T REALLY FOLLOW THAT PATTERN
THAT EXCHANGES ARE CLEAR IN UM WELL I THERE'RE CLEARER IN WHEN YOU'VE GOT FEWER PEOPLE
SO THERE'S FEWER PEOPLE TRYING TO PULL THE DISCOURSE GOALS IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
UM AND THEY'RE CLEARER WHEN UM YOUR GOALS ARE QUITE LIMITED
SO WHEN YOU'VE JUST GOT INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND YOU KNOW THE OR THERE'S A CLEAR TASK THAT THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO AND THEY'RE FOCUSSED ON THAT TASK
AS IS NORMAL IN DIALOGUE ELICITATION LIKE MAP TASK OR LIKE YOUR
LIKE YOUR INFORMA WHICH LIKE YOUR INFORMATION SEEKING DIALOGUES WHICH WASN'T DIALOGUE ELICITATION BUT IT WAS VERY CONSTRAINED IN GENRE
SO UM THE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION MIGHT BE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE CATALOGUE OF EXCHANGES IS FOR REAL MEETINGS BECAUSE UM OR FOR THESE DECISION MAKING MEETINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY EXCHANGES
RIGHT
SO HAVE YOU GONE THROUGH THE MEETINGS AND LOOKED FOR INITIATIONS AND RESPONSES WITH WITHOUT A PRIOR CATALOGUE
JUST KNOWING THAT INIT INITIATION IN INTRODUCES A NEW DISCOURSE GOAL AND A RESPONSE UM MEETS OR NEGATES THAT GOAL IN SOME WAY
SO HAVE YOU TRIED MARKING THESE EXCHANGES
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT BUT A READING OF THIS YOU KNOW
TH COULD TELL YOU THAT THERE IS NO CASE WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR INITIATION AND RESPONSES THAT'S GONNA WORK YOU KNOW
'CAUSE YOU COULD GO THROUGH AND SEE THAT UM ACTUALLY THE PATTERN OF OF ADDRESSING DIFFERENT DISCOURSE GOALS IS TOO DISPERSED TO UM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF MARK UP
BUT I G YEAH I MEAN I OBVIOUSLY YOU WANNA HAVE A FRONT RUNNER SCHEME I IN MIND BEFORE YOU
SO THAT'S IT
YEAH
DO YOU MEAN AN ACTION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE GROUP IS REQUIRING HIM TO DO OR DO YOU MEAN AN ACTION IN LIKE PICKING SOMETHING UP
SO ACTION IN THE TECHNICAL MEETING SENSE OR JUST ACTION IN THE PHYSICAL SENSE
RIGHT OKAY
OH SO THAT'S NOT A PHYSICAL ACTION RIGHT
UH UH IF I PICK THIS UP WHICH IS A PHYSICAL ACTION YOU CAN'T REJECT THAT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S A ACTION IN THE SORT OF TECHNICAL SENSE OF MEETINGS
SO YOU ARE ACTIONED TO DO SOMETHING WHICH IS PART OF THE PERMANENT RECORD THAT YEAH OKAY
WELL THERE ARE VERY FEW UH SCHEMES FOR MARKING UP EXCHANGES ON ACTUAL DATA RIGHT BECAUSE UM PEOPLE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED IT VERY IMPORTANT
WELL I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY GET TIRED AFTER MARKING UP THE DIALOGUE MOVES SO THEY NEV NEVER BOTHER WITH ANY HIGHER LEVEL DIALOGUE STRUCTURE
SO WE DID IT IN THE MAP TASK
BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW OF OTHER CASES WHERE PEOPLE BOTHERED MARKING ANYTH ANYTHING HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE MAP THAN THE MOVE STRUCTURE
RIGHT
YOU DON'T KNOW OF
ON YEAH I'VE S UH SORRY
UM BUT IT C IT'S NOT BEEN VERY POPULAR CAR PROBABLY 'CAUSE IT MAKES UM
DIFFERENT
MM-HMM YEAH
WELL THE FIRST STEP IS FIND OUT IN THE WHAT HOW MUCH OF THE MATERIAL DOES THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING COVER
SO HOW MUCH OF A GENRE CLASH IS THERE HERE
WELL IT'S
YEAH
B TH BUT THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD THAT ARE MOVING THAT DIRECTION LIKE MARTIN
AND ALSO WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THE THEORETICAL CLARITY ABOUT WHAT AN INITIATION AND A RESPONSE IS
SO WHAT IS IT THAT TIES UM DIFFERENT ACTS TOGETHER AT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU KNOW
MM-HMM
BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOOKING AT UM WHETHER PARTS OF THE MEETING ARE HIGHLY INTERACTIVE OR NOT SO INTERACTIVE IS UH LOOKING AT WHAT SORT OF TASK THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO AT THE MOMENT
SO YOU KNOW
ARE THEY DOING UM UH I ARE ARE THEY UH I AS IN THE KICK OFF MEETING JUST EXCHANGING INFORMATION TO GET STARTED WITH A PROJECT OR ARE THEY UH ACTUALLY ADDRESSING SOME SPECIFIC DESIGN UM CRITERIA AT THE MOMENT
SHOULD TRY TO DECIDE WHICH SHAPE THE THING IS
UM BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE KINDS OF RELATIONS THAT YOU GET BETWEEN THE UTTERANCES
AND SO THAT IS MUCH MORE LIKE UM THE UM THE LITERATURE FROM MCGRATH ABOUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES GROUPS GET INTO
SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT HAS TO BE PULLED INTO THIS BECAUSE UM YOU YOU DO REQUIRE DIFFERENT UH UH DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELATIONS
OR YOU EXPECT DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELATIONS FROM SOME OVER ARCHING SET IN UM THOSE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES
UH
UM SO WHAT'S THE HIGH LEVEL VERSION AGAIN
P S
RIGHT OKAY
I MEAN I THE MEETING ACTIONS IS JUST GONNA BE A SEGMENTATION
IT'S NOT GOING TO PRESENT ANY S ANY MICRO STRUCTURE
SO IT'S JUST GONNA SAY FROM HERE TO HERE THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING
THAT'S ALL THAT THAT SCHEME IS GONNA DO
W
IT'S N
THAT'S NOT NO THOSE WELL THAT'S INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
AND THE MEETING ACTIONS ARE MEANT TO B UH BECOME MORE UM SEMANTIC AND MORE THEORETICAL THAN THE KIND IDIAP HAVE TRADITIONALLY USED
SO SO WE NEED TO STILL PRESERVE SOME UH SENSE OF THE ACTIVITY
BUT RATHER THAN SAYING IT IS SOMEBODY'S AT THE WHITE BOARD IT'LL BE YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY'S EXPLAINING SOMETHING THAT THE OTHERS ARE FOCUSSED ON
YEAH
IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT SCHEME
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL YOU MIGHT NEED THE MEETING ACTION SEGMENTATION IN ORDER TO KNOW WHERE WHAT UH WHAT AREA YOU'RE CIRCUMVENTING FOR SO
IT'S JUST EXCHANGE STRUCTURE IN THIS AREA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN THAT'S A SOLID BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE NEXT BIT OR SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW
UM BUT W WELL TIME'S GETTING ON
SO YOU KNOW WHAT PRACTICAL THINGS CAN WE DO TO HELP THIS WORK MOVE FORWARD
SO Y SHOW WHAT ELSE
YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL M MARKING UP EXCHANGE STRUCTURE IF IF IT'S THERE AND IF UM IF YOU'VE GOT A WORKING SCHEME FOR IT IS RELATIVELY CHEAP
IT'S A LOT CHEAPER THAN DOING DIALOGUE ACT CODING IN THE FIRST PLACE
UM RIGHT WELL ONE PRESUMES IT IS OTHERWISE IT'S GONNA BE RA RADICALLY EXPENSIVE TO DO ANY KIND OF MARK UP
SO UM THE YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT BUT YOU NEED TO WHAT WE NEED IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWING
YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED EXCHANGE STRUCTURE MARKED UP ON X. AMOUNT OF DATA AT THIS POINT IS KNOWING UM WHERE YOU'RE HEADED WITH THIS I THINK
SO WHAT'S THE GOOD THAT THAT UH THE PROJECT GETS OUT OF THIS IN THE END
SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE W WHAT'S THE HEADLINE RESULTS OF THE WORK ON THE PROJECT
I THINK IS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HERE
SO YOU GET YOUR EXCHANGE STRUCTURE MARKED UP
AND SAY WE JUST PUT IN THE MONEY GET EXCHANGE STRUCTURE MARKED UP ON THAT ENTIRE HUB OR YOU KNOW
FIGURE OUT HOW TO BOOT STRAP IT SO WE WE GET THIS UM UH HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SELL THAT AS A AS A PROJECT GOAL YOU KNOW
'CAUSE PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY EXCHANGE STRUCTURE SO WHAT
WHAT DO WH WHAT DO YOU WHAT HOW DO YOU PLUG THAT INTO THE REST THE STUFF RIGHT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
SEE 'CAUSE I THINK THAT UM JUST TO MAKE THIS M MORE EFFICIENT
YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE HIGH LEVEL GOAL IN ORDER TO FOCUS THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING RATHER THAN THINKING WELL
YOU KNOW THERE'S THESE THEORIES YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE APPLY THESE THEORIES TO IT
UM AND THEN SEEING WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR THE MEETING BROWSER ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY YEAH
WE HAVE A GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO DO THIS WITH THE MEETING BROWSER UM WHAT KINDS OF DIALOGUE STRUCTURE WOULD WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
I MEAN UH I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU'D WANNA DISAGREE WITH THAT
BUT I THIS MORE GOAL DIRECTED MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE IT EASIER TO UM BRING THESE THINGS TO PUBLICATION IN THE LONG RUN RIGHT
RIGHT
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT THEY SAY
BUT IT'S SOMETHING AT LEAST IDENTIFY SOMETHING THAT WE'D HOPE TO GET OUT OF IT YOU KNOW
MM-HMM
YEAH
I IT JUST HELPS YOU KNOW WHICH THEORY YOU SHOULD BE CONCENTRATING ON
SO YOU KNOW THAT IMMEDIATELY DISCOUNTS EXCHANGE UM STRUCTURES THAT ARE MOSTLY FOR INFORMATION SEEKING ALONE BECAUSE THE NOTION EXCHANGE IS TO RESTRICT IT THERE
AND IN FAVOUR OF UM THESE THESE MORE ARGUMENTATIVE THINGS
SO I MEAN UH I DO THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND WHAT THE FINAL GOAL IS SO THAT YOU CAN PLUG THIS INTO SOMETHING AT THE END AND AND UM SHOW SOME BENEFIT OF HAVING THE MARK UP
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN OPERATIONALLY IT'S NOT GONNA MUCH DIFFERENCE WHETHER IT'S HUB OR NOT RIGHT BECAUSE
WE'VE GOT THE BANK OF PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO GET THE HUB STUFF THROUGH BUT UM YOU KNOW HE'S N NOT READY WITH AN ANNOTATION SCHEME THAT CAN BE USED AT THE MOMENT ANYWAY
SO AND IT IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE
I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN AFFORD OFF BUDGET 'CAUSE
YEAH IT UH AND IT'S TOO DIFFERENT A GENRE YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S NOT HELP EITHER
BUT YEAH THEY'RE SURE TO DO THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IN THE M
MM-HMM
Y
UM WELL I DON'T REMEMBER THAT ABOUT THE W I MEAN THE
OH BUT THAT WAS ABOUT WHAT TASK THE PERSON DOING THE BROWSING WAS GONNA DO
IT W THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT SORT OF INFORMATION THEY'D WANT FROM THE MEETING ITSELF
IT W IT WAS ABOUT UH I
THAT WAS THE THAT WE THE BROWSER TASK
YOU KNOW THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THESE SEVEN DIFFERENT TASKS PEOPLE MIGHT WANNA DO WITH BROWSERS UM YOU KNOW
LIKE UH JOIN A MEETING LATE AND CH UM CATCH UP ON WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE MEETING SO FAR BE AT HOME WAITING FOR THE WASHING REPAIR GUY
AND
YEAH
OKAY WELL C MAYBE
OKAY
MM-HMM
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO AVOID DOING STUFF THAT WAS S STUCK IN THIS PARTICULAR DOMAIN IF POSSIBLE
BUT YOU KNOW TH THEY WEREN'T CONCENTRATING
WELL YEAH
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE UM USING THE TECHNIQUES THAT YOU CAN BE USING OPEN DOMAIN TECHN
MM-HMM
AND YOU DON'T THINK THAT CAN BE DONE IN OPEN DOMAIN AT ALL
'CAUSE WE DON'T WANNA GET INTO UM WORKING WITH ONTOLOGIES
I MEAN ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF THIS GROUPING WAS THAT YEAH THEY ALL WORK WITH THE CLOSED DOMAIN ONTOLOGIES AND WE'LL DO THE OPEN DOMAIN SIDE OF THINGS
SO
I DON'T KNOW
WE'LL SEE
OH RIGHT YEAH
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT ONE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO YOU'RE ADVISING WEI XUN THAT HE SHOULD BE USING LIKE ANY ONTOLOGIES AND PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT THAT UM D. F. K. I. AND T. N. O. BANK IN THE C. V. S. REPOSITORY OR OR NOT
THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT CLEAR ON
WITH OUR WITHOUT
MM-HMM
OKAY
CAN ACTUALLY TRY
MM-HMM
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'LL BANK THESE BY THE WAY
UM 'CAUSE THAT'S IT'S NOT HUB
SO I IT'S ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED TO BANK AS MANY THINGS AS POSSIBLE
SO YOU KNOW W
YEAH
BUT OPEN
YEAH IT'S NOT REALLY AN OPEN DOMAIN TASK YEAH
WELL EVENTUALLY THE HUB IS SUPPOSED TO BE FORTY PERCENT NON SCENARIO
BUT THAT DATA'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE KIND OF COMING IN THE LAST
SO
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT'S QUITE REASONABLE
W WE'VE GOT FIVE ISCA MEETINGS ACTUALLY WHICH ARE STILL UH AN ELICITATION TASK BUT THEY'RE NOT OUR DOMAIN
SO THAT SHOULD HELP SOME
AND THEY'VE BEEN DECLARED HUB
SO SO THEY'LL ACCRUE ALL OF THE NORMAL AN ANNOTATIONS
OF COURSE YEAH YOU'LL YOU'LL NEVER GET THE T. N. O. AND D. F. K. I. STUFF ON IT 'CAUSE THEY'RE ONLY BILLING STUFF FOR THE ONE TO MAKE THE
YEAH JUST FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA HELP HIM TO TO TRY TO MAKE THIS MORE EFFICIENT
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE WE FINISH THAT OFF BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAT WORK'S JUST WASTED RIGHT
WE'RE GONNA USE CHUNKS FOR SOMETHING USEFUL
YEAH CHUNKS ARE GONNA BE NAMED ENTITIES IF NOTHING ELSE
AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION AT WHICH LEVEL
UH-HUH
DIALOGUE ACT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND THAT'S A PROBLEM
YEAH
CERTAINLY IF IF YOU'VE GOT CHUNKS IT OUGHT TO HELP YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR DIALOGUE ACT BOUNDARIES BETTER NOT BE
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND IT MAY BE EVEN MORE MECHANICAL THAN THAT BASED ON THE UM EXAMPLES WE'RE SEEING FROM D. F. K. I.
'CAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE HAND MARKING STUFF AND THE DIALOGUE ACT BOUNDARIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE INTENTIONAL
UM BUT THEY SEEM TO ALWAYS BE MARKING THEM THAT UM UH AFTER VERBS YOU KNOW WITH CLAUSE M UH IT'S VERY IT LOOKS QUITE MECHANICAL
SO WE'RE QUERYING THEM ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT
AND
WELL HOLD ON
BUT WHEN DO WE NEED CHUNKING BY
AND IT YOU KNOW SO Y I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW
YOU START SOMETHING AND THEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER YOU PICK UP TO DO THE LAST TEN PERCENT OF THE WORK TO FINISH IT OFF OR WHATEVER
SO IT I LIKE THINGS KINDA TIDY
RIGHT
SO HOW MUCH WORK IS THERE LEFT AND WHEN DO WE ACTUALLY NEED IT BY WOULD BE USEFUL TO DISCUSS
THE AMI DATA IS IS THERE
THERE'S I MEAN THERE'S HUB SET A. IS TRANSCRIBED I THINK UM IN FINAL FORM
YOU WE CAN CHECK THE WIKIS
BUT YOU KNOW THE DATA IS ROLLING IN
SO
AND BUT BARBARA STILL SAYS SOMEBODY'S DONE THIS FOR CHUNKS
I'LL HAVE TO LOOK UP YOU KNOW SO
MM
HAND CHUNKED
MM-HMM
BUT
THAT SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD TO DO RIGHT
HOW MUCH DATA DO YOU NEED
I DON'T READ LIPS
WHAT WAS THAT
WAS IT HARD
YEAH
THEY THE DATA HOW MUCH DATA YOU NEED WAS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE SWITCHBOARD 'CAUSE HE HAD LOTS
SO HE DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH
SO WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH DATA YOU NEED HAND CHUNKED
AND THEN UH HOW DO YOU HAND CHUNK STUFF RIGHT
SO YOU WERE WERE WORKING ON INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOING HAND CHUNKING
FOR SWITCHBOARD YEAH
BUT THEN HE THERE WERE TWO POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR UH FOR DOING THIS ON THE AMI DATA
YOU COULD EITHER UM ESSENTIALLY GO THE SAME ROUTE AS THEY DID WITH THE SWITCHBOARD UM YOU KNOW
DO THE PENN TREE BANK AND THEN CREATE THE CHUNKS OFF THAT OR YOU COULD CHUNK DIRECTLY
AND IT WASN'T CLEAR TO US WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO METHODS WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS
RIGHT WELL SO YOU'D HAVE TO PRODUCE AS PART OF THIS EXERCISE
YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT SO BUT I DUNNO
OH YES YEAH I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT
BUT THAT'S NOT VERY SIMILAR
WELL I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT GRAMMAR
IS TH IS THAT SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT THAT THIS SAME METHOD COULD APPLY THAT WE DERIVE CHUNKS OFF THE H. P. S. G. OUTPUT
I THINK YOU MIGHT LOSE A LOT IN YOU KNOW THIS STEP
SO BASICALLY YOUR YOUR CHUNKER IS TRAINED ON SOMETHING THAT WAS DERIVED OFF PENN TREE BANK
AND IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT ENOUGH THAT THAT ACTUALLY CAUSES IT NOT TO MATCH
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SUDDENLY EVALUATING AGAINST CHUNKS THAT WERE DONE USING H. P. S. G. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GRAMMAR BUT IT YOU KNOW IT
YEAH
AND THE MAPPINGS ARE CAN BE CR PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR THIS RIGHT
OR IS IS EASY TO MAP BETWEEN FINER GRAINED DISTINCTIONS AND COARSER ONES
THINK SO
YEAH
HUH
THE NAMES WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS THE IDEA RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
SO Y THAT SORT OF ASSUMES THAT WE THINK IT'S BETTER TO DO THIS BY DERIVING CHUNKS FROM UM SOME PARSED FORMAT THAN JUST HAND CHUNKING THE STUFF
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO LET'S TRY IT THIS WAY
AND THEN THAT THAT PUTS OFF THE QUESTION OF UM WHEN DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS TO WHEN WE GET H. P. S. G. STUFF RIGHT
SO CAN YOU ASK UM D. F. K. I. WHETHER THEY CAN GIVE US A COUPLE AMI MEETINGS RUN THROUGH THEIR H. P. S. G. PROCESS
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TIME SCALE THEY HAD IN MIND
I MEAN IT IS THIS SOMETHING THEY W THEY WERE DOING IT AT THE MOMENT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS VERY PRELIMINARY OR DO YOU REMEMBER
TWENTE YEAH
YEAH
Y YOU'RE EXPECTING ME TO REMEMBER STUFF AREN'T YOU
OH YEAH
OH I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE I'VE MISSED
BRUSSELS AMSTERDAM
T. N. O. OKAY
SEE I WASN'T THERE
SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS
UM
YEAH
YEAH
SO ASK 'EM RIGHT
SO IT'S TALK TO ALEX SEE IF IT LOOKS LIKE IT MAPS BY LOOKING AT THE VERBMOBIL
IF IT DOES ASK D. F. K. I. EITHER FOR DATA OR A TIME SCALE AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH DATA YOU NEED IN ORDER TO DO THAT
SO DO YOU HAVE A TECHNIQUE FOR ESTIMATING HOW MUCH DATA YOU'D NEED
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT SO WHO KNOWS HOW YOU DO THAT
OKAY
SO JUST ASK D. F. K. I. HOW MUCH DATA AND WHEN RIGHT
IF
YEAH I KNOW
UH WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR TIME IN MIND WHEN WE NEED A CHUNKER THAT WORKS ON THIS STUFF
SO
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I GUE IF WE DID A CHUNKED VERSION OF THE AMI DATA AND STUCK IT INTO C. V. S. UNDER THE AUTOMATIC CONTRIBUTIONS THEN UM PEOPLE WOULD END UP USING IT
'CAUSE THEY DO THAT RIGHT
SO THE QUESTION IS AT WHAT STAGE SHOULD WE PUT THAT IN
YEAH SO POST EVALUATION SO WE CAN PUT IN SOME IDEA OF WHAT THE EVALUATION IS LIKE
MM-HMM
NO BUT HE'S RELYING IT ON IT TH THIS SUMMER
MM-HMM
SO WHEN WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE
WHEN WHEN IS SHE SENDING SOMEBODY
OH FOR THE NEXT ONE MM-HMM
BUT THAT'S A PRETTY TIGHT TIME SCALE THEN RIGHT 'CAUSE IT'D BE FOR THE FALL WE'D WANNA KNOW THE EVALUATION
IS THAT THE TIME SCALE YOU'RE THINKING OF OR
HOW IT COULD BE DONE
YEAH
UH THAT'S ALL I THINK
UH
MM-HMM
I THINK YOU SHOULD STILL ASK BARBARA AGAIN YOU KNOW C CAN YOU HAVE ANOTHER THINK ABOUT WHO MIGHT HAVE THE CHUNKING STUFF
'CAUSE SHE HAS SAID SEVERAL TIMES THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY AND SHE CAN HELP WITH THAT
AND UM I THINK SHE'S JUST FORGOTTEN
SO
SO AND THEN WE CAN EVALUATE ON THE ICSI YOU KNOW PRETTY EASILY
YEAH EVEN IF IT'S JUST A YOU KNOW ON A WIKI THE UM THE REFERENCES AND THEN WHY THEY'RE RELEVANT RIGHT
I MEAN YOU DON'T WANNA MAKE THIS REALLY FORMAL OR DO YOU
YEAH A PARAGRAPH EACH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THAT WOU THAT WOULD HELP US BE A LOT MORE SPECIFIC AB THAN THAN JUST UM YOU KNOW
LISTING BULLET POINTS ON SLIDES CAUSE THEN WE'D KNOW SORT OF WHICH LITERATURE YOU'RE THINKING OF UM PUTTING IN AND WE COULD READ THE MOST IMPORTANT ARGUMENTATIVE STUFF
I CAN HAVE THESE THINGS ANYWAY YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THEY HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THIS PROBLEM
YEAH
YEAH
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO VERY SOON BECAUSE I'VE GOT THIS UM THIS HEARING TO GO TO
BUT UH SO THE PRACTICAL ACTIONS YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE'RE GONNA GO AWAY AND DO
YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU CAN DO THIS EXERCISE AND THEN COME AND TALK TO ME SOME TIME NEXT WEEK
I'M NOT IN MONDAY BUT THE OTHER DAYS I'LL BE AROUND
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
S
YEAH SO THIS THIS IS INTERESTING BUT I W I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO L UM LOOK AT THIS RIGHT NOW
SO WHY DON'T YOU BRING IT BY UM NEXT WEEK
AND I WHAT I REALLY WANNA DO CONCENTRATE JUST NOW IS IS FINDING OUT THE HOW WE'RE GONNA HELP UM WEI XUN WITH WITH MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS
SO WE'VE ALREADY GOT YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA UM CONSTRUCT A LIST OF THE REFERENCES HE THINKS IS IMPORTANT
AND JOHANNA AND I AND AND YOU AS WELL ARE GONNA CONTRIBUTE TO THAT
AND WE CAN PUT THAT ON A WIKI OR WE CAN DO IT SOME OTHER WAY
I MEAN YOU KNOW I'M WIKI MAD
SO UM IF WE SHARE IT IT SHOULD GO ON A WIKI 'CAUSE I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING IN MY EMAIL
BUT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT
UM AND THEN UH HOW DO WE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS TAKING ALL OF THE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT REFERENCES FOR UM FINDING ARGUMENT STRUCTURE THAT MIGHT I EVENTUALLY BE OF SOME USE TO A MEETING BROWSER AND TRYING TO LOOK AT ACTUAL DATA AND APPLY AND AND SEE LIKE WHICH ONE HELPS YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA DO WITH THIS PARTICULAR DATA
RIGHT
SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD TAKE LIKE THE FRONT RUNNER SCHEME AND THE DATA AND YOU SHOULD LOOK AT NOT FRONT RUNNER SCHEME BUT FRONT RUNNER THEORY AND I SEE IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE DATA
YOU KNOW USING THAT KIND OF THEORY AT SOME POINT
AND MIGHT MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING EXERCISE RIGHT
THE UPDATE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT THAT'S A GOOD STARTING POINT YEAH
THAT'LL BE THE EXACTLY YEAH
SO YOU WANNA GO THROUGH BASICALLY THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THINK ABOUT SOME USER REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR OWN AND MAKE A CASE FOR
YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'D WANT AND LOOK YOU'RE GONNA NEED UM THIS KIND OF DIALOGUE OR ARGUMENT STRUCTURE FOR IT
UM UH UH I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT
YEAH
SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET RECORDS
I MEAN I'M SURE THEY'RE NOT ON THE WEB YET
SO
YEAH
MM-HMM YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO SO WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THE REQUIREMENTS LIKE THAT AND DID DID YOU THINK THAT'S THAT WAS REASONABLE TO AFTER THAT TO TRY AND UM ACTUALLY
YOU KNOW TAKE SOME THEORY THAT SEEMS FAIRLY REASONABLE AND THINK ABOUT THE PARTICULAR DATA AND COME AND TALK
YEAH
I THERE'S A FEW REFERENCES MISSING
YEAH
YEP
SO THEN TRY FRONT RUNNER SCHEME ON WELL A FRONT RUNNER THEORY
YEAH
BUT TRY IT INFORMALLY
YEP MM-HMM
WHEN DO WE GET TOGETHER AGAIN
'CAUSE I REALLY DO HAVE TO GO
I PROMISED THESE GUYS I'D BE THERE
UH-HUH
BUT W
READING LISTS BEFORE THAT THOUGH SO RIGHT
SO WE'LL GET TOGETHER IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS
UH
UH-HUH
FOUR WEEKS YEAH
RIGHT
I'M GONNA HEAD OFF
C 'CAUSE FLOODS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN DIALOGUE STRUCTURE I'M AFRAID
YEAH MM-HMM
HMM
THANK YOU
NO I DON'T THINK SO
I D
HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YES
HMM
MM-HMM
MEETING ACTION
MM
THEY JUST MENTION THAT THEY WANT DECISION UM FOR ISSUES ACTION ITEMS
I THINK THEY ARE MORE TALKING ABOUT UM USER REQUIREMENT FOR THE MEETING THAN SOFT TEXT THEY WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENING IN A MEETING
THEY SAY THAT
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
CONTACT
HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM RIGHT NOW D UH I'M DOING I'M TRYING TO DO THE UH MEETING ACTION SEGMENTATION
J BECAUSE UH AFTER TALKING TO JANE UM JUST UH WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS WHETHER UH MEETING ACTION WILL BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS TOPIC SEGMENTS
SO UM IT WOULD BE GOOD TO UM T RIGHT NOW I'M DOING THIS
UM LOOKING AT THE DATA AND TRYING TO SEE IF I CAN DO THE MEETING ACTION SEGMENTATION FIRST AND THE SCHEME
AND THEN DO TOPIC SEGMENTATION AGAIN TO SEE IF THE BOUNDARY ACTUALLY COINCIDE WITH EACH OTHER
YEAH IF IF THAT THAT DO THEN MAYBE WE CAN TALK AGAIN WHETHER UM I IT IT MAKE SENSE
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT YEAH
UM I HAVE JUST STARTED
AND UM SO FAR UM I S THINK UH IT'S UH IT I THINK IT IT'S A STILL UM ABOUT THE S ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL OF SEGMENTATION WE'RE TALKING HERE
BUT UH MAYBE THE BOUNDARY WILL NOT BE EXACTLY THE SAME
BUT UH THAT THAT THE SEGMENT
MM-HMM RIGHT SURE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM SURE
YES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
MM
I WANT TO SEE
SOMETHING
SURE
MM-HMM
AREN'T THEY SUING HIM
MM-HMM
CAN'T TH CAN'T THEY GET LEGAL AID
HMM
MM-HMM
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO COUNT TO TEN OR SOMETHING
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL THAT
OKAY
THANK YOU
MM-HMM
OKAY SO
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE A PRESENTATION FOR US THEN
GREAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU WERE GONNA DEFINE THIS MORE ON THE SLIDES TO COME OR IF THIS IS AS MUCH AS YOU'RE GONNA TELL US
I'M JUST WONDERING IF HE'S PREPARED
SURE
SO SO WHAT DID YOU HAVE MORE ON LATER SLIDES ABOUT THIS
OKAY
BUT WE'VE ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT IT'S NOT JUST SPEAKER CHANGE IT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE MM-HMM OKAY THEN
OKAY
Y YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL IT MIGHT BE THE CASE THAT TO BE INTERACTIVE THERE HAVE TO BE DIALOGUE ACTS OF SOME SPECIFIC TYPE IN A TURN RATHER THAN
LIKE STATEMENT STATEMENT REJECT ACCEPT YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T QUITE AGREE
I MEAN I FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN'T USE R. S. T. ACROSS SPEAKERS BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS OF THE RELATIONS DEPEND ON THE INTENTIONS OF THE SPEAKER AND THERE'S DIFFERENT SPEAKERS HAVE DIFFERENT INTENTIONS
SO YOU CAN'T USE THE THEORY
IT'S JUST FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG IT'S IT WAS MEANT AS A THEORY FOR A ONE PERSON UH RIGHT
SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T OTHER THEO SO FOR
YEAH
RIGHT
BUT THOSE ARE VERY THOSE ARE REALLY DIFFERENT UM THEORIES THAT ARE AT ARE TRYING TO GET AT DIFFERENT THINGS AND IT AND THEY ADMIT OF M YOU KNOW
SOME OF THEM ADMIT OF MULTIPLE PARTIES AND SOME OF THEM ASSUME YOU'RE IN ONE SPEAKER'S HEAD
RIGHT AND THE
MM-HMM
YEAH THE ENTIRE THEORY IS BASED ON INTENTION AND THE INTENTION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL
SO R. S. T. WOULD BE A BAD THEORY TO USE
W
SO MODELLING MODELLING A SINGLE CONTRIBUTION BY A SINGLE SPEAKER YOU CAN WITHIN THAT YOU CAN USE R. S. T. IF YOU WANT TO RIGHT
BUT ACROSS SPEAKERS YOU CAN'T
THEY HAVE NO RELATIONS FOR THINGS LIKE REJECT OR AGREE
THEY THE THEORY DOESN'T HAVE THEM
SO THE THE SO IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THEORY 'CAUSE THE THEORY IS THE RELATIONS PLUS THE NOTION OF NUCLEARITY
SO WE NEED A DIFFERENT THEORY
NOW I THINK ALEX UM S. D. R. S. ALLOWS BOTH KINDS
SO YOU KNOW WITHIN A SPEAKER TURN YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE EXPLANATION AND CAUSE AND ALL THAT
UM BUT THEN ACROSS SPEAKER TURNS YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE CORRECTION OR I DIDN'T SEE ANY EXAMPLES OF AGREE OR DISAGREE IN S. T. R. S. BUT I THERE AREN'T
I MEAN THERE ARE THIRTY RELATIONS
SO WE SHOULD LOOK AT AT WHAT THEY ARE
BUT I D I DON'T
WELL HER THE RELATIONS HAVE A S
D YES BUT SO I MEAN THE RELATION NAMES IT'S NOT THE NAMES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IT'S THEIR SEMANTICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT RIGHT
AND THEY'RE THE SEMANTICS OF THE RELATIONS ARE BASED ON THE SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCES THAT THEY'RE RELATING AS ALEX S EXPLAINED YESTERDAY
UM AND SO UM IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THESE RELATIONS HAVE A SEMANTICS THAT'S TIED TO THE SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCES RIGHT
UH P POSS POSSIBLY BUT FEW PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO YOU KNOW
DO THE KIND OF UM TRUTH CONDITIONAL SEMANTICS THAT YOU KNOW ASHER AND LASCARIDES HAVE DONE RIGHT
SO THE THEORY CAN HANDLE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN MEETINGS AS SHE EXPLAINED
THE ACTUAL COMPUTATIONAL MECHANISMS THEY HAVE CURRENTLY FOR BUILDING UP THE TREES CAN'T
NOW I DON'T REMEMBER WAS WHICH SPEAKER YOU IN THE C IN THE EXAMPLE SHE SHOWED YESTERDAY
WAS IT THE CASE THAT THE REPRESENTATION OF THE UTTERANCES AND THE RELATIONS INCLUDED WHICH SPEAKER WAS UH
I MEAN IT HAD THE AT THE L AT THE LEAVES THEY HAD THE WELL SHE DIDN'T SHOW IT BUT THEY WOULD HAVE THE SEMANTICS OF THE UTTERANCES
AND THEN SHE HAD RELATION NAMES AND HANDLES
RIGHT
I JUST I JUST DON'T DIDN'T REMEMBER SEEING IN THE REPRESENTATION WHICH SPEAKER CONTRIBUTED WHAT
'CAUSE SHE DID REPRESENT UM DISCOURSE STRUCTURES 'CAUSE THESE WERE THE VERBMOBIL SCHEDULING DIALOGUES
SO THE UTTERANCES IN THE IN THE REPRESENTATION WERE UTTERED BY TWO DIFFERENT PARTIES THAT WASN'T THE YOU KNOW
IN THE IN THE EXAMPLES SHE SHOWED US THERE WERE THERE WAS SOME THAT WAS JUST YOU KNOW ONE PARTY
IT WAS A MONOLOGUE BUT THEN THERE WAS A SNIPPET OF DIALOGUE AS WELL WITH
FOR THIS SPECIFIC SET OF RELATIONS THAT THAT THEY'VE DEFINED
THERE MIGHT BE SOME HIGHER LEVEL STRUCTURE THAT YOU WANNA PULL OUT OF THAT
I MEAN I 'CAUSE YOU WERE SAYING YOU'RE JUST GONNA YOU YOU'RE YOU WANNA LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW VERY LOCAL STUFF
BUT FROM THAT YOU C ONE WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD PULL OUT SOMETHING HIGH YOU KNOW
NO I THINK WORKING FROM THE BOTTOM UP SOUNDS GREAT
BUT I'M JUST Y I MEAN WHAT YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMEONE SAYING WELL HOW DID THEY DECIDE TO MAKE IT BLUE
AND MAYBE THERE WAS A LONG BLOW BY BL AND YOU DON'T YOU KIND OF WANNA ABSTRACT AWAY FROM HE SAID THIS
SHE SAID THAT HE SAI YOU KNOW TO ANYWAY I YOU KNOW I MEAN I I DON'T THINK ESPECIALLY UH
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT STEEPED IN THESE THEORIES THAT IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO YOU WHETHER WE USE R. S. T. OR SOMETHING LIKE S. D. R. S.
BUT IT MIGHT MAKE MUCH MORE YOU KNOW I MEAN
WELL I THINK WE SHOULD ASS I THINK WE SHOULD
TRY TO FIND A THEORY THAT ALLOWS MULTIPLE SPEAKERS AND RELATIONS TO SPAN OVER MORE THAN ONE SPEA YOU KNOW
BECAUSE IT IS TRUE THAT I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE DAMSEL AND OTHER ATTEMPTS TO COME UP WITH ANNOTATION SCHEMES FOR FOR DIALOGUE ACTS
THERE WAS THIS NOTION OF FORWARD LOOKING AND BACKWARD LOOKING
ANYWAY THEY'RE RELATIONAL
I MEAN IN SOME WAY YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL RELATIONAL
UM BUT YOU NEEDED
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF TAGS IN THERE FROM THE KINDS OF RELATIONS YOU SEE WITHIN R. S. T. FOR EXAMPLE
SO IF YOU LOOK AT AMANDA STENT'S THESIS AND THE ANALYSIS THAT SHE DID SORT OF WITHIN A TURN SHE USED SOMETHING LIKE R. S. T.
AND THEN ACROSS TURNS SHE USED DAMSEL RIGHT
WELL I
WELL IT GIVES YOU THINGS LIKE ACCEPT AND REJECT AND
OH YEAH
IN FACT R. S. T. DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING LIKE THAT
OKAY
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT OKAY
D SO I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE IMPOR I THINK IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO GO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FIGURING OUT WHAT KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS WE WANT AND THEN FINDING AND
YOU KNOW LIKE SETTING DOWN WHAT THE CONSTRAINTS ARE ON THE ANALYSIS GAME
HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE DATA OKAY S TO GOOD
UM AND THEN AND THEN THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THEORIES OF ARGUMENT
I MEAN YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT THE SORT OF JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING KINDS OF UM APPROACHES
SO YOU KNOW CLARK AND LOCKBAUM AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT KIND OF THING
THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR DIALOGUE RIGHT I MEAN AND CAN BE EXPANDED TO MORE THAN TWO PERSONS
ACTUALLY THE LOCKBAUM STUFF IS FOR GROUPS
YEAH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO KNOW WHAT M
BUT WHO'S THEY
THAT'S THE QUESTION
WHO
RIGHT
MM-HMM
WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT UM W IT I DON'T KNOW UH W IT'D PROBABLY GET TO RE HEAR YOU KNOW
MORE OF YOUR PRESENTATION BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT CANDIDATES AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T GO THROUGH AND MARK UP EVERY MEETING
I MEAN MARK UP MEETINGS WITH EVERY SCHEME WE THINK OF
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO KIND OF GET AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE CANDIDATES ARE M IF THERE'S LIKE TWO OR THREE THAT WE THINK ARE GOOD CONTENDERS
THEN WE TRY TO SEE WHAT WORKS BETTER RIGHT
THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTION THERE ARE A LOT MORE OPTIONS
SO SO LET'S SEE WHAT WHAT ELSE YOU'VE GOT
OH SO THAT WAS IT ON DIALOGUE OKAY
OKAY
SO UH IT'S VERY UNCLEAR TO ME WHY YOU THINK EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IS MORE PRINCIPAL T UH DID YOU I MEAN WHAT DID YOU HAVE SPECIFIC SCHEMES IN MIND THERE
OR SPEC MM SPECIFIC
PEOPLE'S WORK THAT YOU UM
BUT CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF A SCHEME THAT'S BASED ON EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK THAT UM THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BEFORE I MEAN
YEAH
I MEAN AND
WELL WE'RE MARKING UP A LOT OF HIGHER LEVEL THINGS IN OUR
OKAY
SO UM HAVE YOU LOOKED AT NATE BLAYLOCK'S WORK
SO HE HAS THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW ADOPT UM SO BASICALLY IT'S TO
YOU KNOW COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING YOU KNOW MORE THAN ONE PERSON INVOLVED AND TRYING TO CHARACTERISE THINGS AS UM
YOU KNOW IF I
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ALL THE ACTIONS
NO SO SO THE COCONUT PROJECT IS A PROJECT THAT I DID WITH RICH THOMASSON AND BARBARA DIGINIO
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT
NOT VERY CLEAR
NO
THOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL IN THE PAPER
BUT YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT NO IN VERY MUCH DETAIL
OKAY SO I THINK YOU SHOULD
UM BECAUSE IT WAS ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE DONE FOR JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING AND JOINT ACTION I THINK ARE VERY RELEVANT TO LOOK AT BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE SOLVING A PROBLEM TOGETHER
RIGHT
SO UM WHILE THESE SCHEMES MAY NOT HAVE THEY HAVE SOME ES OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS THAT YOU NEED TO CHARACTERISE UM JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING
SO WHILE TH UM
YOU MAY THINK THAT THEY'RE MISSING SOMETHING THEN WE WE COULD CERTAINLY AUGMENT THEM
BUT I THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT
AND SO SO NATE BLAYLOCK TRIED TO OKAY SO YOU KNOW
FROM GROSS AND KRAUSS AND GROSS AND SIDENER CAME ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT SHARED PLANS AND HOW YOU REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND
YOU KNOW DIALOGUE U UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND SHARED PLANS
BUT THE ACTUAL THEORETICAL UM OR FORMALISATION OF IT WAS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX
AND SO UM LOCKBAUM SIMPLIFIED IT QUITE AND YOU KNOW SIDENER AND RICH AND COLLAGEN HAVE SIMPLIFIED IT QUITE A BIT
UM BUT NATE BLAYLOCK TRIED TO UM YOU KNOW DEFINE
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SOMEBODY SUGGESTS SOMETHING
WELL YOU CAN ADOPT IT YOU CAN WELL I CAN'T REMEMBER YOU KNOW OKAY BUT HE HAS UH HE HAS A TAXONOMY YEAH RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY RIGHT
UM WHICH WE TRIED TO APPLY TO TUTORING BUT IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL FOR TUTORING 'CAUSE TUTORING'S JUST A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BALL GAME
BUT UM IT YOU KNOW
WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING AT IT AND IT DID STRIKE ME THAT FOR JOINT PROBLEM SOLVING THERE W THERE WERE SOME GOOD IDEAS
AND THERE IS YOU KNOW A SET OF TAGS AND WHAT THEY MEAN AND YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF THING
AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT YOU KNOW CL YOU KNOW CLARK ON JOINT ACTION
NOW HE'S NOT GONNA GIVE YOU A SET OF TAGS 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF GUY HE IS
BUT UM
BUT THE OVERARCHING IDEA YOU KNOW
I MEAN I THINK ACCOUNTS FOR A LOT OF THE WAYS IN WHICH UM YOU KNOW THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE THI ARE THINKING
BUT I MEAN I THINK THAT WE WE BASICALLY HAVE TO MERGE SOME OF THIS STUFF THAT'S BEEN DONE YOU KNOW
ON MEETINGS WITH SOME OF THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN DONE ON COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING 'CAUSE THERE'S ELEMENTS OF EACH THAT SEEM REALLY IMPORTANT
AND I THINK TH
BECAUSE IT REALLY SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT AND SOME OF THIS STUFF ON EXCHANGE IS LIKE ANCIENT AND YOU KNOW
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MARK UP LOTS OF DATA AND COUNT THINGS YOU KNOW
SO I MEAN ALL THE CONVERSATIONAL ANALYSIS STUFF I MEAN THOSE GUYS NEVER COUNT ANYTHING YOU KNOW
I MEAN THEY'RE UH PS SO THEY SEE A PATTERN AND THEN THEY THINK IT'S KINDA CUTE AND THEN THEY SCOUR THE WORLD FOR THIRD TURN REPAIRS YOU KNOW
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SAY HOW OFTEN DO THOSE HAPPEN
I MEAN THEY WORKED I MEAN I KNOW MANNY SCHEGLOFF REALLY WELL AND THEY'RE NOT COUNTERS
THEY'RE PURPOSELY NOT COUNTERS
THEY DEFINE THEMSELVES AS NON COUNTERS
MM-HMM
YEAH TH I MEAN IT IT DOES SEEM LIKE YOU KNOW
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT FROM THAT AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT FROM COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING
AND
IF YOU L IF YOU TAKE THE EXCHANGE STUFF IT'S NOT GONNA D QUITE DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING STUFF MAYBE IT WON'T DO EVERY THAT YOU WANT
AND SO
HMM
LIKE SOMEBODY'S WRITING ON THE WHITE BOARD OR I MEAN THE W MEETING ACTIONS THEY PRESENTED AT THE REVIEW SEEMED REALLY LOW LEVEL TO ME LIKE SOMEBODY STOOD UP
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
I MEAN I I REALISE IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WEI XUN GOT UP AND WENT TO THE WHITE BOARD
I REALISE THAT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW
BUT I D WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT THOSE MEETING ACTIONS
SO YEAH MM OKAY
WELL I THINK WE SHOULD APPROACH IT BOTH WAYS
I MEAN UH YOU KNOW I I D
YOU KNOW THE MEETING BROWSER PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF CONSTRAINTS
AND SO WHAT THEY END UP WITH SAYING IS MOST CRITICAL FOR THEM RIGHT NOW MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST INTERESTING THING IN THE LONGER TERM
AND SO
RIGHT
I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW A DECISION HAS EVOLVED RIGHT
UM AND I THINK THAT
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF ALL OF THIS LOW LEVEL STUFF WOULD ALLOW YOU TO TRACK THAT KIND OF THING
BUT IT MIGHT AT LEAST BE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ALLOWING YOU TO TRACK THAT KIND OF THING AND
YEAH SOME HIGHER LEVEL YEAH
SO I MEAN I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMETHING AT THIS LEVEL NEEDS TO BE THERE
I MEAN AND TO ASK QUESTIONS LIKE WHO DISAGREED OR WERE THERE ANY COUNTER PROPOSALS OR WHATEVER
EVEN THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS YOU NEED SOME KIND OF MARK UP LIKE THIS
WELL THAT BRINGS UP SOMETHING INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK PROBABLY WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS TRY TO GET
YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE
TASKS SORT OF PUT ON YOU KNOW SORT OF AS PART OF THE OFFICIAL AGENDA
SO BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE UM WERE THERE ANY COUNTER PROPOSALS TO THE BANA YOU KNOW BANANA SHAPE OR WHATEVER
UM UH OR TO SOME SPECIFIC YOU KNOW RECOMMENDATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT
I MEAN YOU KNOW THOSE YOU KNOW STRIKE ME AS CL CLEAR THINGS THAT YOU KNOW
PEOPLE WHO GO TO DECISION MAKING MEETINGS WANT TO KNOW IF THEY'VE MISSED ONE OR ARE ARRIVING LATE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
SO IT WOU IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET SOME OF THESE THINGS ON THE OFFICIAL AGENDA AND SAY LOOK
YOU KNOW WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF YOU COULD HAVE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING
OH
NO M SO
AND I THINK WE WOULDN'T WANNA NECESSARILY DO THIS ON ICSI DATA
I THINK THE ICSI DATA IS TOO TOO COMPLEX AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH REAL DECISIONS MADE YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD CLEARLY IDENTIFY
I MEAN THERE ARE SOME BUT AND NOT THAT I'VE READ MORE THAN ABOUT TWO MEETINGS
BUT UM I THINK W IT YOU KNOW W WELL SO ONE THING THAT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING IS THE I THINK TO ME
IS THE UM WHAT CAN YOU DO BECAUSE PRESUMABLY THE UM D. F. K. I. FOLK OR SOMEBODY IS GONNA MARK UP A LOT OF THE DATA WITH SORT OF TAGS ABOUT ONTOLOGY
RIGHT
SO WE KNOW YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WILL HAVE GONE AND BY HAND AND SORT OF MARKED UP SOM SOMETHING L LIKE SHALLOW SEMANTICY KINDS OF THINGS RIGHT
OR MAYBE DEEPER SEMANTICY THINGS BUT THAT BUT YOU KNOW
NOT REALLY IN A IN A FORMAL LANGUAGE BUT MOSTLY JUST YOU KNOW TAGS RIGHT
UM AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WELL HOW DOES YOU KNOW
JUST THE WAY PEOPLE TYPICALLY DO THIS IS YOU KNOW
LET'S TAKE THESE SEMANTIC FEATURES INTO OR THESE FEATURES INTO ACCOUNT AND SEE HOW WELL WE DO WITH THE THE LEARNING
AND THEN LET'S THROW THESE FEATURES OUT AND SEE HOW WELL WE DO UM BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE THEM
BECAUSE ONE OR TWO SIDES IS REALLY INTR ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS ONTOLOGY STUFF RIGHT
I MEAN T. N. O. IS AND D. F. K. I. IS RIGHT
SO THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF DOMAIN SEMANTICS
AND THERE WILL ALSO BE PRESUMABLY SOME KIND OF TASK HIERARCHY MODELLING GOING ON IN I MEAN 'CAUSE THE WHOLE BROWSER WORKING GROUP UM FINAL UM SORT OF PRESENTATION ON THAT SECOND DAY WAS ABOUT
YOU KNOW KNOWING THE TASK RIGHT
AND VERY YOU KNOW DETAILS ABOUT WHICH TASK IS THIS YOU KNOW
WHICH SUB TASK IS THIS LITTLE CHUNK OF THE MEETING ADDRESSING AND FURTHERING IN VARIOUS WAYS RIGHT
WHICH SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD IN AN OPEN DOMAIN
YOU REMEMBER WHEN STEVE CAME IN STEVE WHITTAKER CAME IN AT THE END AND SAID YOU KNOW
THEY'D SPENT THE MORNING TALKING AND THEY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA
UM
NO THEY SAID PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT TASKS YOU KNOW
I MEAN THEY REALLY THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WERE THAT THAT WAS GONNA BE HEAVILY
NO THOSE ARE THE S THOSE ARE THE SCENARIOS
THOSE ARE THE USER SCENARIOS
THE TASK WHAT WHAT HE CAME BACK AND SAID THAT AT THE END
I MEAN IT ACTUALLY KIND KIND OF SCARED ME BECAUSE IT WAS ALL BASED AROUND TASKS
AND AND THE DOMAIN TASKS OKAY THEY'RE NOW THEY NOW HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MANY BUTTONS TO PUT ON THIS THING
I MEAN IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE DOMAIN TASK
AND IT IS REALLY THE IT AND GIVEN THAT
UH IT IT'S REALLY SCARY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO IN AN OPEN DOMAIN WHERE YOU DON'T WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TASKS ARE
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO FIGURE THEM OUT UH VERY RELIABLY
I DO BUT THE WHOLE PROJECT IS YOU KNOW FOCUSSED ON AMI HUB DATA AS THEIR FIRST PRIORITY
N NO NO NO NO NO
BUT I MEAN IF THE IF THE IF THEY HAD TH THEY HAD THIS SORT OF EPIPHANY AT THE END OF THIS MEETING WHERE THEY DECIDED WELL WHY ARE PEOPLE BROWSING THIS
WELL IT'S ALL TO SEE HOW YOU KNOW HOW THE PARTICIPANTS WERE FURTHERING THEIR TASKS
WELL RIGHT
AND THEN YES
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS CONFUSION ABOUT THE UM LAST SPIDER PHONE CONFERENCE THAT THE MESSAGES TELLING PEOPLE TO CALL CAME OUT AFTER THE MEETING HAPPENED
AT LEAST TO SOME OF US
SO UM I MEAN WE'LL WE'LL GET THAT BACK ON TRACK
BUT I THINK THAT UM WE DON'T YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE SOME MEETING BROWSER DEMO THAT UM
YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION OF OKAY WELL IF YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE
YOU HAVE TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY
WELL I THINK WHEN HE DOES RE WHEN HE DOES LEAR THESE LEARNING EXPERIMENTS HE SHOULD DO 'EM TWO WAYS
BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH OR WITHOUT
AND THEN WE CAN SEE LIKE WELL WITHOUT YOU KNOW THESE TAGS SO YOU KNOW
ALEX WAS SHOWING UM YESTERDAY WELL WITHOUT KNOWING THE HEAD WORD OF THE UTTERANCE AT THE LEAF
YOU KNOW YOU GET THESE KINDS OF RESULTS AND WHEN YOU ADD THAT IN YOU GET THESE OTHER KINDS OF RESULTS
AND YOU KNOW I THINK YEAH
UM SO I THINK IF WE HAVE THOSE FEATURES IT'S YOU KNOW
IT'S A RARE ORP OR RARE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRY ONE HEAD TO HEAD AGAINST THE OTHER
UM AND THEN OF COURSE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALLY UM
RIGHT
WELL WE WON'T I MEAN WE WON'T USE 'EM TILL THEY'RE READY OBVIOUSLY
SO WE MIGHT DO THE SORT OF OPEN DOMAIN
I MEAN A ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE A CLOSED DOMAIN I MEAN WE WE CAN'T USE ANY DOMAIN INFORMATION NECESSARILY
UH
I MEAN THERE PROBABLY ARE A BUNCH OF ISSUES LIKE IF YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED HOURS OF MEETINGS AND THEY ALL TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS
THEN IT'S EA IT IT'S NOT REALLY OPEN DOMAIN AND SOMEHOW THAT SNEAKS INTO ALL THE STATISTICS ANYWAY 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE SUCH A WIDE VOCABULARY AND YOU KNOW
RIGHT
SURE SO WE MIGHT FIND THAT WHEN WE MOVE FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS OPEN DOMAIN BUT ON THE HUB
YOU KNOW OUR RESULTS GO DOWN WHEN WE TRULY ARE GETTING MEETING YEAH
SO I MEAN THAT'LL BE INTERESTING
OKAY WELL THAT'S GOOD
SO OKAY
SO WE WANNA DECIDE UM WHAT WEI XUN SHOULD DO NEXT AND MAYBE THINK ABOUT MEETING IN I DON'T KNOW A MONTH OR SOMETHING
YEAH MM-HMM
UM SO BEFORE WE DO THAT CAN I JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT CHUNKING
IN THE BEGINNING YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT YOU WERE DOING THIS CHUNKING UM AND YOU'RE DOING IT ON THE ICSI DATA
BUT THIS WAS DID YOU SAY IT TH WASN'T PICKED UP IN AMI OR YOU I I I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT W
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND YOU AND YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT YET
THA THAT'S FINE
SO THAT'S STILL ON THE AGENDA TO DO AT SOME POINT
YEAH
EXACTLY
THAT'S
WELL SO I MEAN RIGHT
UM OR BUILDING BLOCKS
I MEAN SO I MEAN WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW S CHUNKING INTERACTS WITH THE AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION YOU KNOW
BECAUSE UM BARBARA WAS SHOWING THE LOW LEVEL
AND I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CHUNKING SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF SO IF IF YOUR DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTER SAYS THERE'S THERE'S A SEGMENT HERE
BUT YOUR CHUNKER SAID NO
THIS IS A COHERENT CHUNK THEN Y Y YOU KNOW W I MEAN MAYBE THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER TO DO A BETTER JOB THAN
RIGHT
YEAH
PERIODS
OH AFTER UH RIGHT
OKAY
RIGHT OKAY
GOOD
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WELL W
WELL HOW MUCH AMI
WELL YOU WANTED TO DO THE CHUNKING ON THE AMI DATA RIGHT
BECAUSE M
SO WE GOT STUCK AT SOME POINT ON EVALUATION OF CHUNKING RIGHT
THE PROBLEM WAS YOU DIDN'T HAVE ICSI DATA THAT WAS HAND LABELLED FOR CHUNKS
AND WE DECIDED LABELLING THE ICSI DATA FOR CHUNKS WOULD BE PROBABLY DIFFICULT AND MAYBE NOT VERY USEFUL
AND SO IT IT MI
OKAY IF THERE IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS HAND LABELLED DATA THAT YOU COULD EVALUATE AGAIN SO TRAIN ON SOME AND EVALUATE ON SOME
WOULDN'T THAT UM 'CAUSE YOU'VE TRAINED ON SWITCHBOARD RIGHT WHERE THERE THERE ARE CHUNKS
SO IF YOU HAD SOME ICSI DATA THAT YOU COULD MAYBE USE I DON'T KNOW
UM AS A WHAT'S THE N THERE'S T THERE'S A TRAINING SET AND THEN THERE'S THE DEVELOPMENT SET AND THEN THERE'S THE TEST SET
MAYBE YOU'D USE SOME CHUNKED ICSI STUFF AS DEVELOPMENT OR SOMETHING AND DO SOME LAST TWEAKS AND THEN EVALUATE
BUT YOU KNOW W H I MEAN I CAN SEE WHY WEI XUN DIDN'T WANNA SPEND HIS TIME CHUNKING ICSI D
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO GET SOME PORTION OF THE DATA HAND CHUNKED
HOW MUCH UM WELL
HOW MUCH
IN SWITCHBOARD
SWITCHBOARD IS ALL CHUNKED
RIGHT
RIGHT
WELL
NO YOU HAD PENN TREE BANK PARSES AND YOU MADE CHUNKS FROM THAT
MM-HMM
IS ANYBODY GONNA PARSE
IS ANY GONNA TRY TO ANYBODY TRY TO PARSE THE AMI DATA
WELL THEY'RE USING THE E. R. G. RIGHT
THE WHICH PROBABLY HAS A L MAYBE FINER G UH WHICH I BELIEVE HAS FINER GRAINED DISTINCTIONS THAN AND DIFFERENT LABELS THAN THE PENN TREE BANK
IT'S I'M T IT'S PROBABLY EASY TO DUMB DOWN THE H. P. S. G. PARSE TOO
'CAUSE THE PENN TREE BANK PARSERS ARE PRETTY MINIMAL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANNA COMMIT TO A SPECIFIC GRAMMATICAL THEORY
SO I MEAN IT PROBABLY IS WORTH LOOKING AT
'CAUSE THEY'RE DOING THIS WITH DAN FLICKINGER RIGHT
WHICH IS THE SAME UM PARSER AS THE REDWOODS TREE BANK WAS MADE WITH THAT ALEX TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY
SO YOU CAN LOOK AT REDWOODS PARSES
UM AND SEE HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE FROM TREE BANK PARSES
AND YOU MIGHT WANNA TALK TO ALEX TO FIND OUT IF SOMEBODY'S ALREADY DONE THIS TURN REDWOODS STUFF INTO TREE BANK STUFF SO THAT THEY CAN COMPARE
YOU KNOW AGAINST RESULTS THAT ARE REPORTED ON TREE BANK
WELL THAT WAS THE IDEA I BELIEVE BUT UM
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ANOTHER TREE BANK
WELL THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THEN YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH AND PARSE YOU'LL BE GETTING THE SAME CHUNKS AS WHEN YOU DO THIS PROCESS AUTOMATICALLY
'CAUSE THE PROBLEM W WHEN YOU GO THROUGH AND HAND DO IT IS THEN SUDDENLY YOU INTRODUCE YOUR AUTOMATIC METHOD AND YOUR ACCURACY GOES CAN GO WAY DOWN
I MEAN SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T IF YOU KNOW SORT OF FOR PART OF SPEECH TAGGING YOU KNOW
WHETHER YOU DO IT BY HAND OR MACHINE IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ACCURACY RIGHT
BUT
THEY TALKED ABOUT IT AT THE MEETING THAT WE WENT TO IN
TWENTE
I WAS THINKING ENSCHEDE
WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER THE N THE F THE RIGHT NAME OF THIS PLACE
YES TWENTE
WHICH
YOU WERE THERE JEAN
YEAH OKAY
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
I I I KNOW YOU MISSED A MEETING AND S AND SO THERE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN YOU MISSED THE ONE IN T. N. O.
ON ON WHICH PROJECT
SORRY I DIDN'T GET THAT
VERBMOBIL RIGHT
YES YES THEY DID
IT WELL THAT'S THAT'S WHAT ALEX TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY RIGHT
THE PARSE I MEAN THAT'S WASN'T SOMETHING SHE DID BUT THAT'S THE DATA SHE'S USING RIGHT
SO WE HAVE ALL THAT STUFF HERE YOU KNOW THE PARSED VERBMOBIL MATERIAL
SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SEE WHAT THE PARSE TREES LOOK LIKE
YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR D. F. K. I.
AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU THINK OH THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAP THESE INTO PENN TREE BANK STYLE BRACKETING
THEN THEN WE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT
BUT I THINK THEY HAD THAT IN MIND
SO IT'S IT'S WORTH ALSO TALKING TO HER ABOUT THAT
OKAY GOOD
EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAYS THERE'S NO DATA LIKE MORE DATA
YOU KNOW I MEAN THE TYPICAL THING IS TO DO LEAVE ONE OUT CROSS VALIDATION WITH YOU KNOW EIGHTY NINE DIALOGUES
OKAY SO I TRAINED ON EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN OR I TRAIN ON ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE AND OKAY BUT WE SHOULD SPEAK TO STEVE
WE MIGHT HAVE SOME UM
WELL THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT IS CHUNKING GONNA HELP
I MEAN I THINK CHUNKING COULD HELP AUTOMATIC DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTATION
I THINK CHUNKING COULD HELP AS YOU MENTIONED NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
UM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL WE'D WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE PRETTY HAPPY THAT IT'S RELIABLE BECAUSE
MM YEAH
I MEAN OTHERWISE
YOU GET THESE VERY BIZARRE RESULTS BECAUSE THE DATA IS NOT REALLY VERY GOOD
SO UM BUT I AND NOBODY HAS EXPRESSED LIKE MASSIVE INTEREST IN T IN CHUNKING
SO I THINK YOU KNOW NOBODY'S UH WAITING FOR IT
BUT BUT WE COULD WE C I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO BARBARA ABOUT HOW TO DO SOME JOINT EXPERIMENTS OR OR IF SHE'S GONNA BE SENDING OTHER PEOPLE
MAYBE LIZ OR WHOEVER COMES OVER NEXT TIME
UH AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE GREAT IF IT WAS LIZ BECAUSE I THINK SHE IS THE ONE WHO DID THE DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTATION AUTOMATIC
SHE JUST SAID THAT HOPEFULLY BY THE NEXT MEETING SHE WOULD BE BRINGING SOMEONE ELSE OR SOMEONE ELSE WOULD BE COMING INSTEAD OF HER REMEMBER
THE TH NOT TO HAVE NOT TO HAVE IT DONE BUT JUST TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT COULD INTERACT WITH AUTOMATIC DIALOGUE ACT SEGMENTATION
UM AND WE I GUESS WE SHOULD TALK TO YOSHI ABOUT ABOUT IT IN RELATIONSHIP TO NAMED ENTITIES
WHO'S UH WHO'S DOING NAMED ENTITIES BESIDES YOSHI
OKAY
SO WE COULD TALK TO VASILIS ABOUT THAT AS WELL
AND THEN
SO ONE THING THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVEN'T READ I THINK WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE JEAN YOU KNOW
HAS READ A LOT OF LITERATURE AND I'VE READ A LOT OF LITERATURE AND WE THERE IS SOME OVERLAP
BUT THERE'S ALSO QUITE A BIG SPACE WHERE WE DON'T KNOW THE LITERATURE FROM THE OTHER SIDE
AND SINCE YOU'RE GONNA BE READING IT I MEAN IT WOULD BE PROBABLY BE USEFUL IF YOU MADE SOME KIND OF
YOU KNOW REPORT THAT DESCRIBED YOU KNOW OKAY THIS WHAT THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THIS IS
YOU KNOW A SYNTHESIS OKAY HERE'S THE BASIC IDEA BEHIND EXCHANGE STRUCTURE AND
YOU KNOW HERE'S A COUPLE OF YOU KNOW HERE'S THE TWO MOST RELEVANT WORKS THAT I'VE READ OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW TO JUST
OR EVEN JUST LIKE A PARAGRAPH OF YOU KNOW THE BASIC IDEA
JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GONNA GO REA OFF AND READ ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME
AND YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ ALL THIS COLLABORATIVE PROL PROBLEM SOLVING
SO
WELL IN ANY WAY EVERY TIME YOU WRITE A PAPER YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK AND DO THIS RELATED WORK THING ANYWAY
SO IT JUST IT JUST MAKES IT A LOT EASIER UM TO GET THAT
COMMON GROUND I THINK YOU KNOW
I THINK IT'S A REAL ADVANTAGE THAT WE'VE READ DIFFERENT THINGS AND COME AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE BECAUSE I THINK THIS HA THEY THE THE PREVIOUS APPROACHES HAVEN'T REALLY
YOU KNOW TAKEN YOU KNOW THE GOOD FEATURES FROM YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES AND AND TRIED TO PUT THEM TOGETHER
YEAH ME TOO
I CAN SEND YOU A L
WELL I THINK WE BOTH WANNA SEND W WELL I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THIS BUT I YOU KNOW
I WILL SEND YOU OR WE CAN YOU KNOW
CHAT OFF LINE FOR A MINUTE A ABOUT A LIST OF THINGS THAT I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT
AND JEAN PROBABLY MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME
UM
AND IF SABRINA HAS ANY IDEAS WE'D BE HAPPY TO HEAR FROM SABRINA AS WELL
UM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
M
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL I THINK WE NEED TO UM LIKE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER UM FACTOR IN WHAT THIS MIGHT BE USED FOR IN THE END
AND SO EVEN IF IT WE WON'T IT WON'T BE USED
MAYBE IF IT WOULD NEED SOME HIGHER LEVEL ANALYSIS BEFORE IT COULD BE DIRECTLY USED FOR THAT PURPOSE WE SHOULD STILL KEEP THAT IN MIND
AND SO I THINK GOING THROUGH THE PRESENTATIONS THAT UM WERE GIVEN AT THE WORK PACKAGE SIX MEETING WHERE UM AND I THINK IT WAS UM IT WASN'T WHA WAS IT ANITA OR WAS IT OH I'VE FORGOTTEN HER NAME
THE OTHER WOMAN UM FROM TWENTE YOU KNOW THEY TALKED ABOUT
THEY DID THEY HAD DONE A LOT OF QUESTIONNAIRES AND THEY GOT SOME USER REQUIREMENTS OUT OF THAT
AND THEN STEVE PRESENTED UM THE RESULTS OF FOLLOWING PEOPLE AROUND AND LOOKING AT HOW THEY USED THEIR NOTES FROM MEETINGS
AND AND SO THAT WOULD GIVE US SOME IDEAS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT YOU KNOW OUT OF MEETING RECORDS
BUT THEN WE SHOULD ALSO ADD THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE INTERESTING
BUT JUST TO HAVE TO KEEP SOME OF THESE GOALS IN MIND 'CAUSE THEY'RE T O ONE SCHEME MIGHT LET YOU ANSWER THIS SET OF QUESTIONS BUT WOULDN'T HELP YOU AT ALL WITH ANOTHER SET OF QUESTIONS
SO SHOULD WE EXPECT THAT ALL THE SLIDES FROM LIKE THE WORK PACKAGE SIX MEETING OR THE JOINT WORK PACKAGE FIVE WORK PA WILL BE U UP ON ONE OF THE WORK PACKAGE WEB SITES
AND IF NOT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN
HMM OKAY
SOME OF THIS WAS PRESENTED IN AT LEAST THE ONE SPIDER PHONE OR THE SECOND SPIDER PHONE TELECON I WENT TO FOR WORK PACKAGE SIX
SO IF THEY'RE NOT ON THE WEB WE CAN TRY TO LOOK AT THAT
YOU KNOW AT THE MATERIALS THAT WERE PRESENTED IN THAT TELECON WITHOUT NECESSARILY LISTENING TO THE WHOLE TELECON
YEAH
WH
AND STEVE M AND HIS I'VE FORGOTTEN THE NAME IS IT WAS IT SIMON HIS YEAH
THEY THEY'VE I THINK THEY MAY HAVE WRITTEN THIS UP UM IN A REPORT UM
BUT I WOU WOULD HOPE THAT'S ON THE WORK PACKAGE SIX WEB SITE AS WELL
I DO AS I ONCE HE'S READ A COUPLE MORE I MEAN HE'S JUST COMPLETELY MISSED OUT THE COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING WORLD
WHICH I D I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
I MEAN YOU MAY TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT AND SAY NO YOU'RE WRONG AND HERE'S WHY BUT I I I'M GONNA NEED SOME CONVINCING
OR T OR OR TWO AND SEE THIS ONE GIVES YOU THIS AND THIS G AND CAN'T YOU KNOW ARE THEY FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE
OR CAN WE YEAH MM-HMM
OKAY
I THINK THIS IS GONNA TAKE ABOUT THREE WEEKS 'CAUSE HE'S GOT PLENTY OF READING TO DO
SO MAYBE WE GET TOGETHER AGAIN IN THE YEAH I MEAN I'LL SEND THEM THE REFERENCES IMMEDIATELY
IS THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU DO YOU THINK
IS THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU TO TO READ AND THINK ABOUT
IF Y IF IF IT'S TOO TIGHT YOU KNOW I THINK M WE CAN SAY FOUR
OR ARE YOU GONNA BE ON HOLIDAY
YEAH
MAYBE FOUR WEEKS
OKAY
OKAY
SO WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER PROBABLY IN ABOUT FOUR WEEKS YES
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA BRING THIS BEAUTIFUL BABY IN TO SEE EVERYBODY
GOOD GOOD
THAT'S GREAT
YEP
WELL GOOD LUCK SOLVING YOUR PROBLEM
I HAVE TO TICK AND TICK
IT DOES SOMETHING WEIRD WHEN YOU DO THAT
RIGHT
'KAY
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
HE HAS HAD IT CERTAINLY
YEAH
YEAH HE'S BEEN EMAILED IT WHILE AGO
NOW HE'S GONE
OH REALLY
EXCELLENT
WE SHOULD HAVE THESE THINGS IN OUR AREA
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE HIGH TECH THINGS
WELL I GUESS THERE'S TELESCOPES BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT THOUGH ISN'T IT
THAT'S NOT NO
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT ALTHOUGH YOU OH IT ISN'T ACTUALLY USED ALL THAT OFTEN THESE DAYS I THINK
GOSH
RIGHT AYE
RIGHT
GOSH
AND YOU MISS ALL THE THE BODY LANGUAGE AND THINGS
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
OH
RIGHT
GOSH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S VERY ARTIFICIAL THOUGH ISN'T IT
YEAH
NOT VERY SENSIBLE
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH
THAT MUST BE REALLY WEIRD
IS THERE
GOSH
YEAH
GOSH
WELL MM-HMM
GREAT
DO YOU THINK
SORRY I I SHOULDN'T INTERVENE PROBABLY
BUT WELL THE UM ISN'T IT THAT IF UM IT'S A REGION OF THE SPECTRUM THAT'S U
AND WE CAN POINT AT IT
AND THEN IT IS A SP A SP SPECTRAL F F
FEATURE AND THAT ISN'T
YOU THINK
OKAY ALRIGHT
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT'S A FEATURE
UM BECAUSE IN THE S SP SPECTRUM IT DOES THAT AND IT DOES THAT
SO IT YEAH
THAT'S THAT IS WHERE IT BREAKS
SO YEAH
OH YOU WANT TO S SPLIT THAT ONE AND DO YOU INTO TWO
YEAH
YEAH
UH I'D AGREE WITH THAT I THINK
YEAH
THANKS
BUT IF IT HAD BEEN THERE UM YOU WOULD'VE
HAD IT AS A FEATURE
YEAH BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LISTED EXPLICITLY UM THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INCLUDE IT
L LINE RATIO IS AFTER ABUNDANCES
SO
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
UM
WELL
NO
YEAH
UM
WELL I MEAN YOU COULD LOOK AT THIS THIS SPECTRUM AND SPOT THAT UM TH L LYMAN ALPHA HAS BEEN DAMPED
THAT IS A N SPECTRAL FEATURE
OH YEAH
NO THAT'S TRUE
DIFFERENT REDSHIFTS
YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH BUT
BUT YOU'RE GUESSING IN A WAY THOUGH AREN'T YOU
SO
MM THAT'S A THAT'S A TRICKY ONE CERTAIN CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T YOU
WOULDN'T YOU HAVE ALL OF IT
RIGHT WELL TH YEAH TH THAT'S IN THE THE MANUAL
SO
I G I GUESS IT IS
I
AND THAT IT IS ALTERING THE SPECTRUM ISN'T IT
I MEAN IS A CH
CHANGE IN THE S SPECTRUM OF
BACKGROUND OBJECTS
UH IS THAT RIGHT
YEAH
NO
YEAH I THINK SO TOO IN THAT
M
THAT'S ACTUALLY AN IONIC SPECIES ISN'T IT ACTUALLY
NOT A A SPECTRAL FEATURE AS SUCH O ON ITS OWN
NO
B B WHY AREN'T YOU MARKING IT THEN
UH-HUH
WELL THAT'S P WHAT I'M P PONDERING REALLY
UM
YEAH BUT THIS IS UM SPECIES OF CLOUD IT'S A P
A PARTICULAR SPECIES OF CLOUD NOT JUST A GENERAL CLOUD ISN'T IT
SO ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT
OKAY TH
THEN I GUESS NOT THEN
YEAH
AND
BUT IT'S IN THIS S SP SP SP SP SPECTRUM OF ANOTHER OBJECT THOUGH
IT IT ISN'T THE SPECTRUM OF THE CLOUDS
YEAH
THAT IS TRUE
UH AND HE COULD POINT AT IT THAT'S TRUE AND SAY THAT IS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH YEAH
I'M NOT SURE ACTUALLY
I TH I THINK I WOULD MARK IT
AND
AND THAT IT
IT IS A REGION OF THE SPECTRUM AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY USING A REGION OF THE SPECTRUM
AS THE DATA
UM
BUT IF YOU BOTH WANT NOT TO MARK IT THEN FINE DON'T MARK IT
MM
RIGHT
YOU HAVE TO S SPEED UP
WE'LL GO P COULD BE HERE ALL DAY
WELL I Y
YEAH I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
YEAH UH I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FEATURE
REALLY
IT'S A PROCESS ISN'T IT
WELL
ISN'T THAT A PROCESS
IT'S A PROCESS ISN'T IT
WELL IT I WOULDN'T
HAVE ANY OF IT I THINK
I THINK ALL OF THAT IS UM JUST THAT IS PROCESS
ISN'T IT
YEAH
YOU THINK
UM
YOU DON'T THINK THAT IT
ACTUALLY IS ABUNDANCE REALLY IN A WAY
I'M NOT SURE
BUT
I'M NOT SURE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
UH I
WELL BUT IT
ISN'T THIS AN ELEMENTAL UM ABUNDANCE
THAT YOU ESTIMATE ACTUALLY USING A NUMBER OF LINES
IS IT IT ISN'T JUST ONE DISCRETE
LINE IN THE SPECTRUM IS IT
B
I'M NOT SURE
WELL IF YOU T
TWO IS AN IONIC SPECIES AND IT'LL HAVE A NUMBER OF
LINES IN THE SPECTRUM AND YOU'LL UH ESTIMATE
ON THE ABUNDANCE ALL OF THE S SPECIES ACTUALLY USE THE OLD LINES
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IF IT'S YEAH
I THINK SO YEAH
OH WELL WHAT'S NEW
OKAY
WELL THEN HAVE IT IN
YEAH YEAH OKAY
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
OH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SORRY WHAT'S THE I CAN'T SEE
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
I WOULDN'T I THINK NOW PROBABLY
WELL H. L. WAS A LINE THERE REALLY ISN'T IT
SO
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK SO
YEAH EXACTLY THAT
YEAH EXACTLY THAT
YEP
TECHNIQUE
YEAH
THE NETWORK IS AN INSTRUMENT THOUGH ISN'T IT
IT
IT'S E. V. N. ISN'T IT
WELL IT
ISN'T ALL OF
THIS IS AN INSTRUMENT IF YOU HAVE IT ALL ISN'T IT
I THINK SO
YEAH
BUT UM
WHICH IT IS UH I THINK
THAT'S WHAT I THINK
OH I THINK IT'S UH UM S S S STARTING WITH UM EU EUROPEAN I THINK
UH YES
JUST IN EUROPE
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MERLIN AND ALL THE I UM INTERNATIONAL LOGS IN EUROPE ALL
HOOKED UP INTO ONE INSTRUMENT BASICALLY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
DID YOU
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PROCESS AND THAT IT IT WASN'T INCLUDED
YEAH
YEAH
REALLY
WELL I WOULD ARGUE ABOUT SEE BECAUSE I THINK THAT I MEAN TH THAT YOU ONLY EXTRACT THAT AFTER YOU ACTUALLY MODEL A SP SPECTRUM DON'T YOU
YEAH
BUT HAVE A COMPONENT THOUGH AS SUCH
YEAH G UM C
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING THAT
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY UM AFTER YOU ACTUALLY MODEL THE S A SPECTRUM NOT JUST ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE SPECTRUM
YEAH YOU THINK
Y
YEAH
YEAH BUT UM COMPONENT IT IS M MEANS IT'S AN ELEMENT ACTUALLY IN THE MODEL THOUGH
WELL UH
THE EXCESSES YEAH
BUT UM THE COMPONENT ISN'T
I THINK I WOULD
YEAH
YES
YEAH
YEAH
I
I THINK ACTUALLY PRETTY EARLY ON I'D HAVE THOUGHT
WHERE ARE THEY
UH ONLY JUST
I
INTERESTING BECAUSE ON THE HOUR IT YEAH
NO
NO IT IS YEAH
WELL PEOPLE DO THOUGH DON'T THEY
I MEAN IT'S PRETTY S STUPID BUT THEY DO
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH
IF YOU'RE HAVING ULTRA LOOM THIS EARLY ON THEN I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE HERE
I DON'T THINK SO
BUT T Y ARE YOU ARGUING NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING WITH OBJECT IN IT THOUGH
SO THERE GOES
AND YOU S SPEED IT UP AS WELL I THINK
SO
AND SOMETHING TO FIDGET WITH
OKAY
SEE
ON YOUR MARKS GET SET GO
SUCH A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE DONE THESE
AT THE BEGINNING WE DID
UM
WE DID A TRAINING SET DIDN'T WE AND THEN COMPARED TO SEE
WE PROBABLY DID
AND SUPPOSEDLY DECIDED ON THINGS
AND THEN WE DID TH ALL THE REST OF THEM SEPARATELY
YES I THINK
OKAY
YEAH BUT YOU CONVINCED ME
NO THAT'S TRUE
MM-HMM
IT'S THE LENGTH OF IT REALLY
BUT WE HAD
THAT'S REALLY HARD YEAH
MM-HMM
NO
YEAH
AND WE WE HAD A MANUAL WHICH WE HAVEN'T GOT HERE
DO YOU RECKON IF WE GET A COPY WOULD THAT BE USEFUL
ARE WE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE MEETING NOW IT'S STARTED
CAN WE GET BEN TO PRINT US OUT ONE
MM
OKAY
YES NOW WE'RE MOVING WITH THE HEADPHONES
YES HE'S HE'S BEEN E EMAILED IT YEAH
OTHERWISE WE CAN GO ONTO OUR SYSTEM AND GET IT
YES
LET'S SAY SOMETHING RUDE
I OH
TOP
BUT NO HOW LITTLE WORK WE DID
I'M DOING THAT AT YES
YEAH
THEY HAVE GOT A
CONFERENCE THING HAVEN'T THEY
IN THE A. T. C.
I HAD TO FLY TO GERMANY TO DO A TELECONFERENCE THE SAME AS YOU DID FOR THE INTERVIEW
AND THEY FLY YOU TO GERMANY AND PUT YOU ON A FOUR WAY TELECONFERENCE WITH THREE PEOPLE IN CHILE
AND HAD THEY ASKED WE COULD HAVE DONE IT FINE AT A. T. C. AND SAVED ME HAVING TO TO GO TO GERMANY FOR A DAY
BUT
THEY HAVEN'T GOT THAT FAR
MM
AND MINE WAS EVEN IT WAS DIFFERENT AGAIN
W WE HAD IT WAS A FOUR WAY SPLIT SCREEN WITH ME AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE AND IT JUST STAYED LIKE THAT
AND I HAD THE TALK ON A LAPTOP IN FRONT OF ME AND THEY HAD THE TALK ON THEIR LAPTOPS
AND I HAD TO TELL TELL THEM WHEN TO PRESS THE BUTTON TO TURN THE PAGE
IT JUST
YES IF YOU SEE TOWARDS THE TOP LEFT OF THE IMAGE YOU'LL NOTICE AND LUCKILY OLIVIA HAD WARNED ME IT MIGHT BE COMPLICATED
AND SO I HAD SOMETHING WITH WITHOUT VERY MANY UM N NOT LITTLE FLYING IN AND THINGS BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT
BUT I PRACTISED THE TALK YEAH STANDING UP IN FRONT OF IT AND POINTING TO THINGS
AND YOU'RE SITTING DOWN IN FRONT OF AND YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF BUT NOT ONLY COULD S YOU SEE YOURSELF YOU SEE YOURSELF BOUNCE BACK TWO SECONDS LATER
BY THE TIME THE SIGNAL HAD GONE TO CHILE AND BACK
SO YOU'RE LIKE OH DID I JUST DO THAT
AND THEN YOU REACTING TO WHAT YOU DID A WHILE AGO
IT WAS A REALLY DAFT SITUATION
LOVELY
AND THEN WE CAN START FIGHTING ABOUT
YES LET'S
CONTINUUM FLUX OR CONTINUUM
MM
YES
FLUX ON ITS OWN WOULDN'T BE A SPECTRAL FEATURE
I THINK IT SHOULD PROBABLY JUST BE CONTINUUM
IF IT WAS CONTINUUM LUMINOSITY YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T IT
OOH
OKAY IT'S MY PART
OH
I THINK I THINK WE'VE WORKED
YES AND I'M PRETTY SURE I'M BOTTOM ANYWAY
SO EVEN ON ONE WE CAN TELL
'CAUSE I WOULD FIGHT FOR LINE BEING A SPECTRAL FEATURE AS WELL
IT'S A BIT HARD TO MARK ON THIS
LET'S DO THAT
THE ONES WE WANT
YES
AND IF NEITHER THEN WE'LL HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING ELSE
AND I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT SOFT COMPONENT IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE
OOH
WELL IF YOU DON'T NO
YEAH GO AHEAD
MM-HMM
PI
YOU CAN POINT TO A SOFT COMPONENT
YEAH
IS IT
UH NOW IS A FEATURE PART OF SPECTRAL FEATURE
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL
'CAUSE IT IT'S NOT JUST ABSORPTION
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABSORPTION POINT FIVE K. V.
IT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING IN THE ABSORPTION THAT YOU'RE SEEING
IF IT WAS A
A DIP IN ABSORPTION OR A
A LACK OF ABSORPTION YOU WOULD PUT IT IN BECAUSE WE SAID WE WOULD PUT DESCRIBING WORDS
MM-HMM
YOU WOULD GET A PENCIL
THAT'S TWO
AH THERE'S ONE WITH THE EQUIVALENT WIDTH
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WE WE WEREN'T GONNA MARK THE EQUIVALENT WIDTH BUT WE WERE GONNA MARK THE LINES
BROAD LINE
AND THAT SHOULD BE A AND NEBULAE
AS A SOURCE TYPE
I CAN'T REMEMBER
SHOULD WE SEE WHEN THE MANUAL COMES
SO LET'S COME BACK TO THAT ONE
UM
YEP
I WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT THAT EITHER
SELECT A
YEAH THAT SEEMS REASONABLE
YES
UM
BREAKING THE POWER LAW INDEX I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A YOU CAN POINT TO IT BUT EQUALLY IT'S NOT A IT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE DERIVED
SO WHAT'S A BREAKING A POWER LAW INDEX
MM-HMM
YEP
OKAY
SLIGHT DEPRESSION OF THE CONTINUUM NEAR THE LYMAN LIMIT
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY W
YEAH I IF IT WAS ABSORPTION AT H. ALPHA THAT WOULD ALL BE ONE
OR ABSORPTION AT FIVE THOUSAND NANOMETRES WOULD ALL BE ONE ANYWAY
BECAUSE IT WAS AT A CERTAIN POINT
BUT THIS IS NEAR
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
IT'S IT'S NEAR RATHER THAN AT
IT'S NOT
LET'S MARK THAT THEN
YES
IS THAT K. CLEAR
OH
MM ABSORPTION
YES AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL
TELL YOU WHO'S MORE AWAKE AT THIS
MM-HMM
AN ABSORPTION FEATURE
THANK YOU
THERE IS NO STEEP SOFT COMPONENT BUT OUR TWO K. V.
MM
YES YOU COULD
I TEND TO MISS OUT THINGS IF THEY'RE TOO LONG
UM
YOU WOULD POINT TO IT
YEAH
YES I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
SHOULD WE GO BACK TO NUMBER FIVE
BUT YES NEBULA
MM-HMM
I THINK IT DOES
WE WEREN'T MATCHING A H. TWO REGIONS BECAUSE IT WAS A REGION I THINK WAS THE ARGUMENT FOR THAT
LINE AGAIN
LINE IN RATIOS
BUT I REMEMBER WE WEREN'T GONNA MARK LINE RATIOS BUT WE WERE GOING TO MARK 'CAU WE'RE HERE WHERE YOU'VE GOT EQUIVALENT WIDTH OF H. BETA ORBITED
RATIO IS DIFFERENT I GUESS
MM
I GUESS IT'S SIMILAR
DON'T INCLUDE
IS THAT THE VALUE OR IS THAT THE WORD
DON'T IT IN INCLUDE THE DERIVED PROPERTY
YOU WOULDN'T INCLUDE LINE IN THAT
OKAY
THE ONE TO KEEP YEAH
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS I THINK THAT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE EVEN THOUGH IT'S
YOU WOULDN'T MARK THE SOURCE TYPE
HERE
YES BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IT UNDERLINED
IT SHOULDN'T BE HIGHLIGHTED
SO
YEAH
M
MM-HMM
BUT IT'S ALSO A I I IF WE HAVE
BUT TH BUT YOU ALSO ABSORB THEM BY Y YOU OBSERVE THEM BY THEIR SPECTRAL FEATURE
WHAT WERE WE DOING FOR THINGS BROAD ABSORPTION LINE QUASAR FOR EXAMPLE
WE WERE MARKING THE BROAD ABSORPTION LINE AS WELL AS BROAD ABSORPTION LINE QUASAR
SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THAT
IF IT'S DEFINED BY A SPECTRAL FEATURE WE SHOULD MARK IT
HERE
YOU COULD POINT TO DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA THOUGH
BECAUSE IT SAYS HERE SPECTRAL FEATURES WE'RE NOW REFERRING TO A TYPE OF SOURCE E. G. QUASAR
UM NOT A BIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF SOURCE BUT I THINK STILL THE THE SPECTRAL FEATURE GE COUNTS EVEN THOUGH IT'S M A MODIFIER OF SOMETHING
WHAT DO YOU RECKON BOB
HOW DOES IT WORK
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHICH DOESN'T HELP
MM-HMM
Y YE
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S YOU COULD STILL SAY THAT'S DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA AND THAT'S DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA
YOU COULD SAY ALL OF THAT IS DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA
BUT ISN'T THAT J ALWAYS THE CASE WITH SOMETHING THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY
MM-HMM
IT IT IF IT WAS IF IT WAS SOME OTHER SPECTRAL FEATURE AND THEN ABSORBERS
WOULD WE MARK IT
BUT
BUT WE INCLUDE MODIFIERS OF SOURCE TYPES WE WOULD MARK
WE'RE NOT MARKING ABSORBERS
BUT IF IT WAS A DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA QUASAR
THEN WE WOULD MARK QUASAR AND WE WOULD MARK DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA
IF IT WAS BROAD ABSORPTION LINE QUASAR WE'D MARK IT
YEAH
SO IT'S JUST I GUESS WHETHER DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE
IN ITSELF
WHICH I WOULD PROBABLY SAY IT WAS BUT THEN I'VE NEVER LOOKED AT I ONE
MM-HMM
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S SPECIFIC
I GUESS Y YOU KNOW WE WE SAY A UH BIG BLUE BUMP OR A SOFT OR A CONTINUUM
AND WE INCLUDE THOSE
THAT TRUE BUT W WE HAVE INCLUDED C POWER LAW THOUGH
WELL NO WE INCLUDED P STEEP SOFT COMPONENT SORRY
AND HERE WE INCLUDED BREAKING THE POWER LAW BECAUSE OF THE BREAK
MM-HMM
BUT THERE'S STILL SOME DEGREE OF FITTING AND IT'S STEEP YOU'RE SAYING
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STEEP AND WHAT'S SHALLOW
LET'S HAVE THAT FOR NOW THEN
YOU IF IF WE CHANGE OUR MIND LATER WHEN WE GO THROUGH WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK TO IT AND SAY
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
AND ABSORPTION AGAIN
RIGHT WHAT HAVE WE GOT DIFFERENT HERE
HMM
IT'S
YEAH IT'S THAT ONE AND THIS ONE HERE
OH WE WERE INCLUDING FEATURE WITHIN SPECTRAL FEATURE
OKAY
I THINK I JUST MISSED IT
I THINK IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S A ALTHOUGH IT'S FOUR WIDTHS HALF MAXIMUM IT'S STILL THE S THE LINE WITHIN IT
SILICONE TWO IS AN ELEMENT RATHER THAN A
IN THIS CONTEXT
RATHER THAN A LINE
THESE ARE THE LINES
I GUESS WHAT YOU W
IF WASN'T IN THERE THEN YOU'D HAVE IT SILICONE TWO LINES AT BUT WITHOUT WITH THE I THINK THAT MEANS SILICONE TWO DERIVED FROM THESE TWO FEATURES
OKAY
MM
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST YOU CAN POINT TO ON THE SPECTRUM
SO WE HAVEN'T BASICALLY WE JUST HAVEN'T GOT A A RULE FOR
SPECTRAL FEATURES WITHIN OR REFERRING TO S TYPES OF SOURCE WHEN WE'RE NOT BOTHER MARKING THE SOURCE
SO ARE WE MARKING H. TWO AND H. TWO REGIONS FOR EXAMPLE
OH THAT'S TRUE
BUT B YEAH BUT I GUESS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT DEFINED BY A SPECTRAL FEATURE THOUGH H. TWO REGION WHEREAS
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST IS DEFINED BY THE DEFINITION OF LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS IS THAT THEY HAVE LYMAN ALPHA FORESTS
BUT SOMEONE'S L SOMEONE'S LOOKED AT THAT SPECTRUM
I DON'T THINK WE WERE MAKING DIFFUSE DIFFUSE EMISSION OR
UM
HMM
MM
IT'S A MODIFIER OF OF CLOUDS BUT I DON'T TH DON'T THINK IF WE'RE INCLUDING THE
I THINK IF WE'RE NOT INCLUDING NEBULA AND CLOUDS WE CAN'T INCLUDE
PERHAPS WE SHOULD'VE DONE
BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE FOR THE WHOLE THING
SO I THINK MAYBE WE JUST NEED TO PUT UNDER DON'T INCLUDE DIFFUSE EMISSION
BUT THEN WE STILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF WE DON'T LABEL THE SOURCE WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE SPECTRAL FEATURES THAT DEFINE THAT SOURCE
I IF WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE BROAD ABSORPTION LINE OBJECT WE MARK THAT
WE MARK BROAD ABSORPTION LINE IN THAT
IT'S AN BUT JUST TO KNOW THIS IS A LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUD WE'RE SEEN LYMAN ALPHA FOREST
BUT IT'S STILL A SPECTRAL FEATURE EVEN IF IT'S NOT IT MIGHT BE A SPECTRAL FEATURE I NOT IN THE CLOUD
BUT IT A SPECTRAL FEATURE IN THE QUASAR THE LYMAN ALPHA FOREST
OKAY
EVEN IF NOT MARKED
NO ONE ELSE CAN READ THAT SORRY
OKAY SO TH LYMAN ALPHA FOREST AGAIN
AND THAT DEFINITELY IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE ON ITS OWN THEN 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T EVEN SAY LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS
EACH HELIUM TWO OPTICAL DEPTH I THINK THAT'S ELEMENTAL SPECIES
OH
OH WE MARKED THE SAME LINES
WHAT HAVE WE DONE DIFFERENTLY
'CAUSE THE PROPERTY OF THE LINE
THEY'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF THESE
AND WE WEREN'T USING LINE
WHAT WAS THE ONE WE DIDN'T DO BEFORE
LINE RATIO WE WEREN'T DOING
WAS TALKING ABOUT L LINES OKAY
LINE FEATURE NEED THAT
THERE'S ONLY ONE DIFFERENCE HERE
NO NO THEY ARE THE SAME OTHERWISE
QUITE IMPRESSIVELY
THAT ONE'S THE SAME
AND DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA DATA
I CAN'T EVEN BUT IF YOU SAID
IF YOU SAID THE SPECTRAL DAT
THE CONTINUUM'S SPET MM
BUT IF IT'S A DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SPECTRUM YOU'D MARK DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA BECAUSE IN THE SPECTRUM
AND AND A DA IS EQUIVALENT OF SPECTRUM
THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS TALKING ABOUT S BUT IF IT'S SAYING SILICONE TWO LINE
LEVELS THE NEW WORD
I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT IN THE CASE OF IT BEING DATA
MM
WELL
IF IT'S AN EMISSION LINE DATA
MM
IF IT'S AN EMISSION LINE DATA WOULD WE PUT IT IN
BUT IF IT JUST SAID EM BUT IF IT JUST SAID EMISSION LINE WE WOULD
IT THE EMISSION LINE IS STRONG
THE EMISSION LINE DATA SHOWS STRONG
THEN UH I THINK IT'S THE SAME ACTUALLY I TH I THINK IT'S DATA ISN'T EVEN NEEDED
IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA AT MORE THAN THE NINETY NINE PERCENT
OR THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA FEATURE IF YOU PUT FEATURE THERE RATHER THAN DATA THEN YOU'D MARK IT
BUT I THINK DATA IS EQUIVALENT IF
YEAH
OKAY
THAT'S THINK ENOUGH
GIVEN THAT WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT IT FOR TEN MINUTES IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT CLEAR CUT
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SYSTEMS AND UH IT SHOULDN'T BE EITHER OF THEM
IT SHOULD BE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA
IN RED WHATEVER THAT IS
SPECTRAL FEATURE
AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE AT ALL
AND I'VE DONE IT TWICE
IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH
FLAT SPECTRUM
WE WERE INCLUDING MODIFIERS INCLUDING BROAD LINE QUASARS NON BROAD LINE QUASARS AS WELL
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY INCLUDE THE FLAT SPECTRUM WITH YOUR Q WITH YOUR QUASAR IS A VERY DIFFERENT FROM STEEP SPECTRUM
WE'RE TEN PERCENT OF THE WAY THERE
CONTINUA
OH GOSH IT WILL BE HERE FOREVER
REMARKABLY SOFT IONISING CONTINUA
YOU'RE RIGHT THOUGH I THINK
OR OR CONTINUUM
THE ABSORBED CONTINUUM
MM-HMM YES
OXYGEN SHOULDN'T BE THERE
THAT'S NOT OBSERVED
HEAVY ELEMENT ABSORPTION LINES I THINK SHOULD BE THERE
NOW WHAT ELSE IS DIFFERENT
MM
OH THANK YOU
AND THAT ONE
YOU'RE RIGHT STAR FORMING GALAXIES ARE DISTINCT
THAT'S YEAH DERIVED
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU WERE DOING SEVEN THOUSAND OF THESE AN HOUR
YOU MEAN THAT
IF IT WAS LINES FROM H. TWO YOU'D MARK IT
BLUE WING FLUX
WHAT WERE WE GONNA DO ABOUT FLUX
DOESN'T SAY
YES IT'S THE AMOUNT OF STUFF IN THE BLUE WING
SO I'M HAPPY WITH THAT
LINE PEAK
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE MARKED
EVEN THOUGH IT'S TALKING ABOUT INCREASING LINE PEAK IT'S ALSO TALKING ABOUT INCREASING EXCESS BLUE WING
SHOULD ACTUALLY BE EXCESS BLUE WING FLUX
ANYWAY
I THINK LINE PEAK IS SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT TO
NO BUT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T S ALSO POINT TO INCREA INCREASING BLUE WING
WHAT
MM
OKAY
LIGHT
YE YES
RIGHT
NEUTRAL HYDROGEN GUNN PETERSEN ABSORPTION
I THINK ALL OF THAT'S A SPECTRAL
FEATURE
IT'S BASICALLY A WAY OF SAYING THE GUNN PETERSEN T IT'S A WAY OF SAYING THE GUNN PETERSEN TROUGH THOUGH
WHICH IF YOU JUST SAID THAT IT'S GUNN PETERSEN ABSORPTION FROM NEUTRAL HYDROGEN RATHER THAN I IF IT WAS A T IF IT WAS HYDROGEN ABSORPTION
YOU'D MARK THE WHOLE THING
IF IT WAS HYDROGEN ALIGN YOU WOULD SO YOU SHOULD MARK IF IT WAS OR H. BETA ABSORPTION
IT'S A MARKS THE KIND OF SPECTRAL FEATURE DOESN'T IT
BUT SO IS H. BETA ABSORP UH EMISSION AS A PROCESS FROM H. BETA
BUT IT'S STILL THIS IS A PROCESS FROM NEUTRAL HYDROGEN
I GUESS WHAT I'M MEANING IS NEUTRAL HYDROGEN SHOULD BE IN THERE
AND THE FACT THAT GUNN PETERSON COMES BETWEEN IT
IS JUST A PAIN
MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
LET'S JUST CROSS EVERYTHING OUT
BLUE SHIFTED ABSORPTION
I THINK IT'S A MODIFIER OF THE THING AND SO IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE THERE
AS IN WE'RE PUTTING WEAK AND STRONG ABSORPTION WOULD COUNT SO I THINK BLUE SHIFTED SHOULD
UM
THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE LINE ISN'T IT
SO THAT SHOULD BE IN
YEAH
THAT'S TALKING ABOUT UH
STRENGTH RATHER THAN
IT'S NOT THE UH ABUNDANCE OF IT OR ANY DERIVED PROPERTY IT'S JUST THE STRENGTH OF THE LINES
I GUESS PERHAPS IT IS
UM LET'S MAKE A DECISION
I GUESS IT COULD BE ABUNDANCE
YES THAT'S TRUE
I THINK YOU PROBABLY SHOULD THEN 'CAUSE WE WILL PUT IN OUR ALIGN STRENGTH
UH IF IT'S A F. I OF A TWO LINE STRENGTH WE WOULD DEFINITELY PUT IT IN
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S REFERRING TO EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT
IT'S NOT SAYING
TWO
ITS LINES
IT'S AN ABUNDANCE I IT'S AN ELEMENT I GUESS BUT IT'S
BUT IT'S A STRENGTH RATHER THAN ABUNDANCE
I THINK THAT'S STILL LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT OF FLUX COMING OUT OF THE OUT OF ALL THE F. E. TWO LINES RATHER THAN
IN GENERAL WE HAVEN'T IF UNLESS IT'S SPECIFICALLY SAYING IT'S A LINE BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS JUST AS SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO A LINE
AND I MAYBE IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH TO MARK
LET'S NOT MARK IT THEN
WELL LINE NARROW LINE
IF IT SAYS IT F. E. TWO LINE STRENGTH THEN WE WOULD MARK IT 'CAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LINE OF IT RATHER THAN THE EV ELEMENT
THE WORD LINE SHOULD BE IN THERE
OR
YEAH I THINK THEY MEAN L
I THINK THEY MEAN THE LINE STRENGTH RATHER THAN THE F. E. TWO ABUNDANCE
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY PROBABLY MEAN
BUT IT'S JUST NOT VERY CLEAR
B. S. BLOATED STAR
THAT'S A
YEAH
UM TAKE OUT LINE
AND THAT'S JUST THE WRONG
THAT'S JUST THE WRONG COLOUR AS IS THAT
I THINK YOU WERE RIGHT THERE
YEP YOU'RE RIGHT
AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL
THAT'S A PHYSICAL PROCESS
YES THAT WAS ONE I WASN'T SURE ABOUT 'CAUSE INFRARED
AND IF IT WAS MID INFRAR UH IF IT WAS YOU'D PUT IT IN
THAT'S JUST THE WRONG NA THAT'S JUST THIS SHOULD BE A SOURCE NAME
I DON'T KNOW W
YES
I GUESS THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO WHAT DOES THAT M MEAN
I PRESUMED IT
IS IT
OKAY RIGHT
'CAUSE THAT'S ONE I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT
UH I THOUGHT IT WAS A CATALOGUE
MM
H. ALPHA I THINK SHOULD BE MARKED YEAH
YEAH YOU'RE STILL DETECTING A LINE EVEN IF YOU'RE DETECTING IT FROM BROAD BAND FILTERS
UM
BROAD BAND
BROAD LINE REGION YOU ARE RIGHT
AND NOW ALIGN NEBULAE
OKAY WE'LL JUST GO BACK AND CHANGE THOSE
YOU'RE RIGHT
OKAY WHERE WAS IT
STARTED HERE
UM
WHY DID IT SO WE MARK
UM WE HAVE GOT NEBULAE MARKED HERE
OH
YEAH OKAY MODIFIERS WITH THEM WHICH IS GIVE A YELL IF YOU SEE ONE
SO DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
BUT THEN I'M I I P I PROBABLY USE THAT RULE SO HALF THE TIME AND JUST FORGOTTEN TO USE AT OTHER TIMES
MM
YEAH
YES I I'M SURE I'VE FOLLOWED THAT RULE SOMETIMES AND JUST FORGOTTEN
SO LET'S TAKE THAT OUT
UM
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST HERE
BUT LYMAN ALPHA FOREST SHOULD BE IN HERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT UH M IT'S NOT MODIFIED
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA DATA
DATA I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP IN
BECAUSE IT'S WOULD BE THE SAME AS FEATURE
OR SPEC SPECTRUM
I THINK DATA'S THE SAME AS SPECTRUM 'CAUSE THE DATA IS A SPEC M
FINAL VIEW BOB
OKAY
MM LET'S TAKE THAT OUT
AND THIS ONE COMES OUT AS WELL
OKAY SO WE WANT NOTHING
THERE
DIDN'T IT
YEAH
RIGHT
WE'RE THERE
RIGHT
H. ALPHA DETECTION
BUT I WOULDN'T IS H. ALPHA BROAD BRAND
IT'S A LINE
WHETHER YOU DETECT IT
H. ALPHA EMITTERS ARE NOT
A DISTINCT CLASS OF SOURCE I DON'T THINK
LINE
MM-HMM
BUT I GUESS IF YOU'RE PICKING OUT A SPECTRAL FEATURE EVEN WITH A BROAD BAND OR NARROW BAND THEN IT'S STILL A SPECTRAL FEAT FEATURE
IF YOU'RE PICKING OUT A LINE
WHAT HOWEVER YOU PICK IT OUT
LINE ON ITS OWN
I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF THOSE WHICH MAKES LIFE SIMPLER
YEP
ABSORPTION PROFILES
I THINK THAT I THINK THE WHOLE THING SHOULD ACTUALLY BE MARKED
EVEN THIS COMPLEX
HOW FAR SHOULD WE GO
COMPLE JUST ABSORPTION PER
UM
LYMAN ALPHA FOREST LINE BLANKETING OR LYMAN ALPHA FOREST LINE
IS IT A SYSTEM
V. L. B. A. IS AN INSTRUMENT
OH IS IT
IS A NETWORK
BUT IS IT
YES
V.
V. L. B VERY LONG BASELINE ARRAY
V. L. B. A.
IF IT HAD AN A. ON THE END IT WOULD BE THE NE INSTRUMENT
YES 'CAUSE IT TA IT TAKES AN IMAGE
SO OH BUT THEN A M RESEARCH GROUP COULD TAKE AN IMAGE
OKAY LET'S OH HOW MUCH OF MODIFIERS ARE WE PUTTING IN
FROM ONE POINT SIX OR FROM EUROPEAN
OR JUST UM V. L. B. A.
HE'S USING CAPITALS
BUT S
OKAY
UH-HUH
OKAY
THAT'S JUST BROAD BAND ISN'T IT
BROAD LINE EMISSION
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE MARKED
RADIO LOUD OBJECTS
IT'S NOT VE IT'S NOT A M MOD IT'S NOT AN ORIGINAL SYSTEM
M
ANYTHING ENDING IN OBJECT WE DON'T INCLUDE YEP
SO NONE OF THOSE
YEP
NOW WE'VE BOTH MARKED LINE RATIOS HERE
AND THAT'S THE SAME
CONTINUUM
AND THERE IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IONIZING CONTINUUM WHICH IS A PRE
YEAH
I THINK YOU CAN POINT TO LINE PAIRS
AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
YEP
SCRIBBLE AWAY
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
THAT'S ALL ONE BIG SPECTRAL FEATURE
AND NEBULA SHOULDN'T BE MARKED
WHAT DO WE DO BACK HERE
WHAT DID WE DO BACK HERE
WE DID MARK NEBULA YES
IT WAS THINGS THAT WEREN'T DISTINCT LIKE YEAH
MM-HMM YEAH IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA STICK TO IT LET'S STICK TO IT
THE
THE
AND I THINK WE NEED THE
I THINK WE WOULD PUT STOP PUTTING THE IN WE COULD GET CONFUSED
AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
OH YEAH
LINE BLANKETING YOU THINK Y
WE HAD LINE BLANKETING JUST NOW AND WE INCLUDED IT
I THINK WE SH UM
WHERE WAS IT
DON'T THINK N LYMAN F FOREST LINE BLANKET WE TOOK BLANKETING OUT
AND THAT'S ALL THE SAME
YES
YES IT IS
RED AND BLUE COMPONENTS
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE AS WELL
YEAH I THINK I IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU CAN POINT TO
THE SOFT X. RAYS OR OR THE HARD X. RAYS YOU CAN POINT TO THE RED AND THE
HMM
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE C THE CONTINUUM THOUGH
IF YOU HAVE A GALAXY SPECTRUM THOUGH YOU CAN SAY THERE'S THE BLUE COMPONENT THERE'S THE RED COMPONENT TO THE SPECTRUM
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN I LIKE IT COMES FROM ADDING TWO DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER
I CAN SEE THAT YEAH
YES
BUT IF IT SAID RED OR BLUE EXCESS RATHER THAN RED OR BLUE COMPONENT I GUESS THE PROBLEM WITH
MM-HMM OKAY
LET'S
IF YOU MODELLED IT WITH TWO PARTS ONE THAT HAD A A HA A HARDER AND SOFTER SPECTRUM HUBBLE IN HUBBLE DEEP FIELD SOUTH
I DIDN'T INCLUDE IT
ALTHOUGH IT DOES APPLY TO THE TELESCOPE
BUT MM
LET'S KEEP IT IN
ANYONE REMEMBER WHEN
LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING
OH
EXCELLENT
UM
HUBBLE
NO WAIT THE TOP ONE I THINK YOU SHOULD INCLUDE
POSSIBLY WITH FLUX AS WELL THOUGH
AND THEN YES THE WHOLE THING
WELL I SAID RADIO GALAXIES
NOW WHAT DID WE P WE SAY ABOUT ACRONYMS WHERE PART OF IT WAS USEFUL
UM
UM
BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MARK HIGH RED SHIFT IN THAT
THEY ARE JUST RED SHI BUT YES
WH WHAT DID WE SAY ABOUT ACRONYMS WHERE
YES I THINK YOU ARE
SEYFERT ONE POINT EIGHT AND ONE POINT NINE GALAXIES
YOU WOULDN'T SAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YES
I THINK THEY PROBABLY ARE
INSEPARATE
AND IT'S JUST THE AND THAT ANNOYS
MISSION LINE FEATURE WE'RE GONNA INCLUDE
GALAXY WHEN IT'S A PROCESS
YES
AH NOW THIS IS ONE
WHERE IT SHOULD BE THIS ONE BUT WHAT IF YOU'D UN IF THESE ARE DOUBLY UNDERLINED
HAS IT JUST PLOTTED THE TOP COLOUR
YES
OKAY BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT HERE LET'S JUST MARK WHAT WE WANT AND MARK THAT BUT WITH ALSO BROAD LINE
I CAN'T WRITE
WE CHANGED IT SO THAT YOU COULD
YEAH BECAUSE QUITE OFTEN UH AN OBJECT CLASS IS DEFINED BY A SPECTRAL FEATURE
LIKE BROAD LINE RADIO GALAXIES
BROADER LINES I THINK
LIST THE WRONG WRONG COLOUR FOR A FEW THINGS
OH IT'S ALL HERE
HYPER LUMINOUS GALAXY
MM-HMM
THIS IS JUST A COLOUR ISSUE
YE
YEAH THEY SHOULD ALL BE AND THAT ONE
I. S. M.
IT'S DIFFUSE
SO IT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
OH
NO
WHAT WE DOING ABOUT NEBULA AGAIN
I'VE FORGOTTEN
OKAY
YEAH
FEATURES
FLAT SPECTRUM RADIO QUASARS
STRONG DROP IN THE CONTINUUM
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT AGAIN
THAT'S JUST THE PLACE
UM WE'RE NOT DOING EMISSION LINE WHEN IT'S A MODIFIER OF OBJECTS ARE WE
THE QUESTION IS ARE EMISSION LINE OBJECTS A SEPARATE CLASS OF SOURCE
I THINK THEY ARE
YES YOU'RE RIGHT
AND SEYFERT GALAXIES W SHOULD BE ONE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
I GOT THREE SEVENTY
RIGHT
WE DID YEAH
YEAH WE DID TWO OF THOSE DIDN'T WE
I THINK WE DID TWO TRAINING SETS AND THEN WE HAD AT LEAST ONE MEETING WITH YOU WHERE WE TALKED IT ALL THROUGH
YES
YEAH
I'D SAY NO
BUT I D I MEAN I THOUGHT WE HAD BASICALLY THE SAME IDEAS TO B I DON'T REMEMBER EVER HAVING STRONG ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE IN WHAT GROUP OR IT WAS JUST THE RULES ABOUT THINGS THAT S YEAH
AND WHAT COUNTED AS WHA AS FOR THE SPECTRAL FEATURES IT WAS MORE CONFUSING WHAT COUNTED AS A SPECTRAL FEATURE AND WE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER SORT OF ARGUING FROM DIFFERENT SIDES AND CONVERGING JUST SORT OF PIECING OUT WHAT WOULD COME UP AND AGREEING WHAT WE'D DO
IT PROBABLY WOULD BE BUT I DON'T I IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME YEAH SINCE WE'VE DONE THIS
YEAH THAT WOULD BE HANDY
SIGN OFF
WE DID SEND IT TO HIM YEAH
YEAH
THERE'S A COOL LITTLE COUNT DOWN CLOCK THAT LETS YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN MEETING AS WELL
NO WE DON'T AT ALL
YEAH
BUT THEY'RE HARDLY IN OUR AREAS
UH
YEAH I DID AS WELL
NO
IT'S A VERY STRANGE INTERVIEW FEELING AS WELL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THEM WHILE YOU'RE GIVING YOUR TALK
BECAUSE THEY JUST SHOW USUALLY THEY HAVE A CAMERA ON YOU AND A CAMERA ON THEM
BUT DURING THE TALK PART THEY HAVE A CAMERA ON I BELIEVE THEM 'CAUSE I COULD SEE THAT GUY READING A NEWSPAPER HALFWAY THROUGH MY TALK
AND THEN THEY HAD A CAMERA ON SHOWING WHAT MY SLIDES WERE AND SO YOU FORGET THAT THEY CAN SEE YOU AT ALL
AND SO WHEN ALL THAT WAS OVER THEY WERE ANSWERING ME QUESTIONS AND THE VIEW SWITCHED AGAIN I REALISED THEY WERE SITTING THERE IN THE INTERVIEW GOING
SO
YEAH
AND YOU CAN'T SAY LOOKING OVER HERE
LIKE O
YEAH
YEAH
IT IS REALLY STRANGE
MM
EXCELLENT
RIGHT
SHALL W SHALL WE DIVE IN IN THE INTERIM
OR
MM
NO YOU WOULDN'T DO
I THINK I'M DO I THINK I'M WORKING OUT WHO'S TOP AND BOTTOM
UM
YEAH I'M HAPPY ENOUGH WITH THAT
I DON'T FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT
AH
BEN SAID HE HE LEFT IT OUT ON PURPOSE WHICH IS REASON
YEAH
I'M PRETTY SURE I'M TOP
UH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT AS WELL
OKAY NEXT
OKAY
SO HERE WE'RE MISSING SOFT COMPONENT ON THE BOTTOM
THERE
IF YOU GET LINE I GET SOFT COMPONENT
YEAH
YOU CAN POINT TO A SOFT COMPONENT
YEAH
IT'S A BIG BUMP IN THE SOFT BIT
IT C UH YEAH I'M NOT FUSSED ABOUT THAT
THEY BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING
YEAH
THIS IS THE THIS IS THE THING YOU POINT TO YEP
YEAH THAT'S THE THING YOU POINT TO AND THIS IS A PH A PHYSICAL MECHANISM
SO YEAH I'D SAY
TWO DOWN
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN TO GO
EXCELLENT
MM THAT'S DEFINITELY TWO
YOU'RE RIGHT
I THINK THAT'S TRUE
ALRIGHTY
WHAT ARE WE MISSING
BROAD LINE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YOU GET THAT
UH
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE DOING WITH NEBULAE
WE WEREN'T DOING LIKE H. TWO REGIONS AND STUFF WERE WE
I CAN'T REMEMBER ACTUALLY
YEAH
YEAH
YES
MM WE WERE DOING DESCRIPTIONS THAT MADE THINGS SEPARATE CLASSES IN WHICH CASE I'D ARGUE FOR ELLIPTICAL I THINK
MY GOD I'VE JUST GONE MAD WITH THE UNDERLINING HERE
YEAH I
YEAH THAT'S THE THING BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT WAS A P YEAH
THE PARALLEL INDEX IS SOMETHING YOU DESI DERIVE
A BREAK IN A SPECTRUM IS SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT AT
SO
YEAH B THAT THING THERE
AND IF I DID IT AGAIN I'D SAY A SLIGHT DEPRESSION OF THE CONTINUUM AND POSSIBLY WELL
'CAUSE YOU CAN SEE BOTH THE SLIGHT DEPRESSION AND THE LYMAN LIMIT
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY THE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS OF THE FEATURES
SO
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT THEY WOULD BE THE SAME THEY'D BOTH BE THE SAME SPECTRAL FEATURE WHEREAS HERE THEY'RE TWO SPECTRAL FEATURES
THERE'S A LYMAN LIMIT WHICH YOU COULD SEE AND THEN THERE'S A SLIGHT DEPRESSION NEAR IT
BUT
YEAH
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE ABOUT THAT
YEAH
EXCELLENT
YEAH OKAY
UH-HUH
THAT I DIDN'T MARK BECAUSE IT'S THE PHYSICAL PROCESS OF ABSORPTION
NOT THE THE THING
YEAH IF IT WAS THERE'S AN ABSORPTION FEATURE OR ABSORPTION TO SEE IT THE SPECTRUM AT THIS WAVE LENGTH
BUT WHEN YOU SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE THE QUASAR IS ABSORBED THAT JUST MEANS THE QUASAR IS BEHIND A A BUNCH OF STUFF
SO THAT'S DESCRIBING SOMETHING PHYSICALLY RATHER THAN DESCRIBING THE SPECTRUM ITSELF
SO
THANK YOU
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO ABOUT THINGS THAT WEREN'T THERE
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT TO
YOU COULD POINT TO IT IF IT WERE THERE
MARKED IT YEAH
YEAH
HUH
OH YEAH
YEAH
WHAT WERE WE SAYING ABOUT NEBULA
SOURCE TYPES
NO NEBULA COUNTS DOESN'T IT
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT'S LINE RATIOS
BUT
UH LINE IN IN LINE IN LINE RATIOS IS MODIFYING RATIOS
IT ISN'T IT
IT'S IT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC LINES
A LINE RATIO IS A THING
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T INCLUDE ABUNDANCES OR LINE STRENGTHS
YEAH IT SHOULDN'T BE IN
I DON'T THINK
WHOOP NO
OH I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE CIRCLING THE ONE WE LIKE RIGHT
OH SORRY UM YEP
UH RIGHT DAMPED LYMAN SEE AGAIN THAT'S UH THESE ARE SOURCE TYPES THE UM I MEAN IT'S NOT A SOURCE TYPE
B
BUT DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS ARE TH ARE PHYSICAL THINGS NOT SPECTRAL FEATURES
YE
BUT UH YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO POINT SOMETHING IN A SPECTRUM AND SAY THAT'S A DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBER UNLESS YOU'D
YEAH YOU COULD DO
BUT WE WOULDN'T SAY ABSORBERS WERE A TYPE OF SOURCE
OKAY
I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THAT BUT I
HMM
BUT
D DON'T WITH DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA OBSERVERS YOU THEM A VARIETY OF PLACES ALONG THE LINE OF SIGHT
SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW
IF YOU LOOK AT A QUASAR AND YOU SEE A BUNCH UH IF YOU GOT A BUNCH OF CLOUDS OF GAS IN THE WAY
YOU CAN SEE THESE THINGS AND BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO POINT AT ONE OF THEM AND SAY AH THAT'S A DAMP YEAH
THEY'RE GONNA BE AT DIFFERENT RED SHIFTS
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO TH THAT
BUT
YEAH
YE
WELL NO BUT YOU SEE THEM IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT RED RED SHIFTS
IT'S LIKE THE THE LYMAN ALPHA FOREST SORT OF
AND I'M NOT CERTAIN I WOULD
I WOULD MARK THAT
IT'S A TRICKY ONE
UM NO I WOULDN'T BECAUSE IT'S THEY'RE PHYSICAL THINGS NOT SPECTRAL FEATURES
YOU CAN'T POINT AT SOMETHING ON A SPECTRUM AND SAY THAT'S DEFINITELY A D DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SOME I G AND I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE MODIFIERS OF THIS SOURCE TYPE
AND WE WOULDN'T MARK THAT SOURCE TYPE
WE WOULDN'T MARK ABSORBERS NO
YEAH
YEAH
HMM IT'S TRICKY ONE
OKAY
OKAY
BUT WE WEREN'T GOING TO INCLUDE S DESCRIPTIONS OF SPECTRAL FEATURES THAT WERE BASED ON FITTING WERE WE
HAVE WE
STEEP SOFT COMPONENT
YEAH BREAKING THE POWER LAW IS SOMETHING I'M NOT CERTAIN OF
STEEP SOFT COMPONENT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT AT IN A SPECTRUM AND SAY THERE IT IS
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S TRICKY
YEAH
THAT'S GRAND
YEAH
YES
UM AGAIN I'D SAY THIS THIS IS A PHYSICAL PROCESS NOT A SPECTRAL FEATURE
UH
YEAH
UH I DON'T HAVE K. STAR BUT I SHOULD DO
WAIT WHERE
OKAY
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BROAD H. ALPHA
RIGHT
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
OH NO WE'RE BACK TO IT AGAIN
THAT'S TRUE BUT LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS ARE SOURCE TYPES WE AREN'T MARCHING MARKING
WHICH WE DON'T MARK YEAH
BUT WE CAN JUST BE CONSISTENT
AND I DON'T THINK WE ARE 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT A SPECTRAL FEATURE IN THE SPECTRUM WE'RE LOOKING AT
YEAH
BUT SAYING THAT ISN'T THE SAME AS SAYING WE'VE SEEN THAT IN A SPECTRUM
WHEREAS A BROAD LINE QUASAR SOMEONE HAS LOOKED AT IT AND THEY'VE SEEN A BROAD LINE
BUT IF YOU'RE DISCUSSING LYMAN ALPHA FOREST CLOUDS THEY COULD JUST BE DISCUSSING THE PHYSICAL OBJECT WHICH WE AREN'T MARKING
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING BLOBBY I DI I DIDN'T MARK
YEAH
YEAH
I W I REMEMBERED NOT MARKING NEBULA OR CLOUDS OR
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE DOING IT
YEAH BUT BOB'S SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD BE UH INCLUDING NEBULA AND CLOUDS
BUT WE HAVEN'T FOR THE WHOLE THING
YEAH
BUT THAT'S 'CAUSE WE'VE TO KNOW IT'S A RATHER BROAD ABSORP ABSORPTION LINE OBJECT WE HAVE SEEN IT
UH
YEAH
YEAH
LET'S KEEP THEM
NOPE
AND HERE
YEP
MM-HMM
THERE THAT'S DERIVED YOU'RE RIGHT
OH RUBBISH
EXCELLENT
UH YOU'VE GOT LINE BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES
YEAH
YEAH WE ARE
YEAH I DON'T THINK LINE BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES COUNTS
'CAUSE IT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT A SPECIFIC LINE
SO YEAH
I DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS
FEATURE
RIGHT
MM-HMM
OH NO
YEAH THEY'RE ALL THE SAME
YES EXCELLENT
UM DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA AGAIN
SYSTEMS
THAT'S A MODIFIER OF DATA
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S A DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPE OF DATA
A D
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS
I WOULDN'T BUT YOU WOULD
I THINK JUST BECAUSE IT'S GOT A SPECTRAL FEATURE IN THE PHRASE
YOU WOULDN'T FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE WERE SAYING SILICONE TWO LEVELS WE DIDN'T MARK SILICONE TWO
THAT'S THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SPECTRUM
BUT WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS IS WE'VE MADE SOME MEASUREMENTS BASED ON DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA MEASUREMENTS AND THEY TELL US THIS ANSWER
AND THIS ANSWER IS INCONSISTENT WITH THAT ANSWER
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT
HMM
M
I WOULDN'T BUT BECAUSE IT'S A MODIFIER OF DATA
OH FEATURE ABSOLUTELY
B BUT
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
ALRIGHT
TAKE IT AGAIN BUT SYSTEMS SHOULD BE OUT
YEAH
MM 'KAY
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN
YES
RIGHT
SOURCE TYPE
DID WE HAVE A RULE ABOUT THIS
MM-HMM
YEP THAT'S TRUE
THAT IS TRUE
ARE WE
EXCELLENT
JUST HITTING THE HALF AN HOUR MARK
SEE THAT I THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE THE FLUX OF KIN OF IONISING PHOTONS RATHER THEN THE CONTINUUM OF THAT SPECTRUM
SO I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE
OXYGEN ABUNDANCE
YEAH
MM
I'M HAPPY ENOUGH WITH THAT
BLUE SHIFTED
THAT'S OKAY WITH ME I DON'T CARE
YEAH YOU CAN HAVE THAT AS WELL
THERE YOU GO
NEXT
UH
I THINK THEY ARE
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THAT
I DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL
YEAH COULD BE THAT I WAS A BIT SLEEPY
LINES FROM IONS
YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LINE FROM AN ION AND A LINE LINE FROM SOMETHING ELSE
WELL YOU'D KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IN THE
WELL I GUESS YEAH I DUNNO
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S TRUE
ALRIGHT
YEAH BUT THE FEATURE ITSELF IS BLUE WING FLUX OR IF IT WAS SAID BLUE WING FEATURE WE'D MARK FEATURE
HMM
YEAH
POSSIBLY
DON'T KNOW
AH UH
YOU CAN POINT TO IT BUT CAN YOU POINT TO A LINE PEAK VELOCITY SHIFT
WELL YOU CAN POINT TO BLUE WING FLUX 'CAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR LINE AND THERE'S THE BLUE WING FLUX
BUT IF THE LINE PEAK IS INCREASINGLY SHIFTED YOU'D
MM THERE'S A SYSTEM ISSUE AGAIN SO WE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT AND KEEP IT
RIGHT
YEAH
MM
MM
I THINK I MIGHT AGREE WITH YOU
'CAUSE THIS DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T BE MARKED
BECAUSE THAT IS A PROCESS NOT A
A
AND IF THAT SHOULDN'T BE MARKED THEN THAT SHOULDN'T BE MARKED
RIGHT
OH OKAY
MM
YEAH
HMM YES
OKAY
YEAH I'M NOT SURE EITHER
BUT UM
B OH YEAH EITHER THAT IF THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN NEITHER SHOULD EITHER OF THOSE
MM YEAH
A FEATURE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IS IT
UH
WE'VE MARKED THING HAVE WE MARKED THINGS LIKE
YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE MARKED THINGS LIKE SILICONE ONE
THROUGHOUT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IF WE DON'T MARK IT THOUGH WE DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T MARK THESE TWO SHOULD WE
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT
IF THAT'S TRUE THEN THEIR LEAVING OUT THE WORD LINE I DON'T SHOULD MEAN THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE MARKED
BUT
BUT I MEAN WE KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN
LIKE
YEAH LET'S LEAVE IT IN
NEXT
UH
OH IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS
OH YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
SEYFERT TWO
OH YEP
YOU'RE RIGHT
RADIO LOUD COUNTS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
THAT COUNTS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THE AND THIS SHOULDN'T BE SHOULD IT
M M DOES THOSE COUNT AS MODIFIERS ACTIVE WE DEFINITELY INCLUDE ACTIVE
SO
IT'S A K KIND OF ELLIPTICAL IS IT
A E. TWO IS A KIND OF ELLIPTICAL
WHAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE J. MEANS
THOSE CAN DOES THAT NOT MEAN A A BROAD BAND DETECTION
AND DOES THAT COUNT
UH H. ALPHA DETECTION
BUT DON'T WE SAY WE DON'T DO THAT
AH
I'M RIGHT LOOK
DON'T INCLUDE MODIFIERS OF REGIONS OR SYSTEMS E. G.
REGION SYSTEMS
THAT'S WHY I WASN'T DOING IT
G AH LOOK AT THAT
YEAH BUT B UH MODIFIERS OF REGIONS OR SYSTEMS IS THE
YEAH WE COULD ALWAYS CHANGE THIS IF WE THINK WE'RE RIGHT RATHER THAN GOING BACK THROUGH AND
BASED ON THIS BUT WE COULD CHANGE THIS RULE RATHER THAN CHANGING ALL THOSE THINGS
WHAT'S THE WHAT WAS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO AT THIS POINT
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEP
'CAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED THAT RULE
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
UM
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S FINE
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA SYSTEMS
AH WE'RE BACK TO DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA DATA
OKAY
I
I DO I STILL DON'T THINK THAT GOES IN
BUT
YEAH
I STILL DON'T LIKE IT
BUT
I DON'T HAVE PASSIONATE FEELINGS
YEP
YEAH JUST CROSS THOSE OUT
OOPS
EXCELLENT
SO WHAT WERE WE LOOKING AT THIS PAGE FOR ANYWAY
IT WAS FOR SOMETHING ELSE H. ALPHA DETECTION
UH
BROAD BAND DETECTIONS IS IN DON'T INCLUDE
OH SO IT WOULD BE A NARROW BAND DETECTION A NARROW BAND IMAGING DETECTION
ALRIGHT GOOD
NO THEY AREN'T
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
OKAY YEAH
RIGHT
UH THIS IS ANOTHER SYSTEMS THING
OKAY
YEAH
NO
UM
YEAH ABSORPTION PROFILES I'LL GO FOR
WHY NOT
YEAH TAKE OUT THE BLANKETING
HAS THIS
AH RIGHT
YEP
YEAH V. L. B. I. IS UH A NET UH IT'S IT'S A V. L. B. I. IS IT'S A TECHNIQUE
IT'S NOT A YEAH
WHAT'S IT'S CALLED SOMETHING ELSE ISN'T IT
THE V. O.
YEAH IT'S CALLED A V. L. B. A.
THIS IS
V. L. B. I. NETWORK IMAGE
SO DO THEY MEAN THE V. L. B. A.
EUROPEAN V. L. B. I. NET
IS IT IN IT IT'S AN INTSTRU GROUP INSTRUMENT NOT A RESEARCH GROUP
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE PROPER NAMES
BUT I DON'T
YEAH IS THAT SO THIS WHOLE THING IS AN INSTRUMENT YOU SAY
OH
OH I SEE I SEE
YEAH
SO IS THIS LIKE IT'S A SUBSET OF THE V. L. B. A.
RIGHT
COOL
RIGHT
OH
THAT IS A SOURCE NAME YOU'RE RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S JUST
MM-HMM
WE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT OBJECTS AND I THINK IT'S THAT WE DON'T USE IT
YE
YEAH BUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE
SO THAT'S IT YEAH
YEAH THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A SOURCE NAME
YEAH THAT MEANS THAT'S A PROC IT'S A PROCESS OR IT'S A IT'S A TYPE OF PHOTONS THAT'S NOT THE CONTINUUM YOU'RE LOOKING AT
SURE YOU CAN YEP
MM NOPE
NEITHER SHOULD THAT
EXCELLENT
HAVE WE AGREED ON THAT
WE ONLY AGREED THAT SO FAR WE'VE ONLY AGREED THAT WE CAN'T INCLUDE SPECTRAL FEATURES MODIFYING NEBULA
BUT I DON'T SEE YET WHERE IT'S WRITTEN DOWN THAT YOU CAN'T MARK NEBULA
YEAH
YEAH BUT THE SEE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF NEBULA
I THINK IS WHY I WASN'T DOING IT
YEAH
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM LET'S HAVE THEM
WHAT'S DIFFERENT
OH YEAH
UM DON'T MIND
MM-HMM
YOU'RE RIGHT
THERE
SOURCE TYPE
LINE BLANKETING
SH I NO I DON'T THINK I DID I
SO THAT YEAH
DID WE
AH
UM
WE DID JUST HAVE IT DON'T KNOW
IT WASN'T THAT FAR BACK WAS IT
NO IT WASN'T THAT FAR BACK
LINE YEAH WE TOOK BLANKETING OUT SO I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE IN
IS THAT IT
YEAH
UH THAT'S A SOURCE NINE
ISN'T IT
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK I'M RIGHT
OH YEAH
YEAH
MM THE SOFT EXCESS YOU CAN DEFINITELY POINT TO ON AN X. RAY THING
YOU KN YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ONE THERE OR NOT YOU COULD SAY THAT'S THAT
SO
YOU'RE SAYING YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT WAS SOFT UNLESS YOU'D
W OH YEAH
I SEE WHAT
MM
BUT RESULTS FROM SPECTRAL
GIVE THAT FOR RED AND BLUE COMPONENTS BUT I WOULDN'T PROBABLY GIVE THAT FOR SOFT COMPONENT
BECAUSE A SOFT EXCESS IS A UH I MEAN THAT'S AN X. RAY THING
LIKE A BREAK YOU SAY OH LOOK THERE'S
MM
YEAH
YEAH I'D TAKE OUT RED AND BLUE
WHICH MEANS MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE OUT SOFT
BUT IT'S SUCH A BASIC SORT OF YOU LOOK AT A SPECTRUM AND YOU SAY THAT'S A A SOFT EXCESS IT'S A SOFT
YEAH
IT'S JUST A T
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE YEAH
UM HUBBLE AND HUBBLE DEEP SENT TO US
YEAH
YEAH
SO SHOULD W DID WE HAVE A SOFT COMPONENT EARLIER
SO WE SH SHOULD KILL IT
NO
YEAH
THERE IT IS
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
MM D YEAH OKAY
YEAH THAT'S FINE I'M HAPPY WITH ALL THAT
YEAH
YEAH THAT COUNTS
DO WE HA DID WE S MAKE A DECISION ABOUT RADIO GALAXIES
'CAUSE I THINK
THEY ARE DISCUSSED AS A SEPARATE SOURCE TYPE AREN'T THEY
RADIO GALAXIES
IT HIDES THAT YEAH
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
WHERE PART OF IT'S USEFUL
I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MARK THE WHOLE THING AREN'T YOU
YEAH SO YOU'RE RIGHT
UM
IT'S A SUB CLASSIFICATION OF SEYFERT'S
WOULD MAKE A S STUDY SEYFERT ONE POINT EIGHTS
OH DO THEY
YOU'RE RIGHT YEAH
YEAH THAT'S FINE
UH YEP
YEAH GALAXY AND GALAXY FORMATION DOESN'T COUNT
AND YES THAT COUNTS
BUT IN
YEAH
RIGHT BUT I'M ON THE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD GO IN
DON'T MIND
OH UP HERE
YEAH
MM
IS IT
OR IS IT OH RIGHT
AND Q. S. O. IS NOT YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
YEP
THE I. S. M. ISN'T A SOURCE TYPE
IS IT
WE'RE NOW INCLUDING NEBULA AREN'T WE
MM WHAT HAVE WE DONE FEATURES
MM YEP
OKAY
NOPE
YEP
WE AREN'T DOING EMISSION LINE OBJECTS
OH NO WE AREN'T DOING THAT EITHER YOU'RE RIGHT
MM NO
THEY AREN'T ARE THEY
YEAH
YEAH ANYTHING TO DO WITH OBJECTS
SO NOTHING
YEAH
YES
HMM
DID DID YOU GUYS ACTUALLY HAD SORT OF UM THE INTERACTION OR DISCUSSIONS WHILE YOU WE DOING THE ANNOTATION
DID YOU HAVE HAD STAGES OF CLARIFICATION OR I SUPPOSE YOU DID RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO DID YOU FEEL THAT IT WAS SOME SOME KIND OF SOME PROCESS OF CONVERGENCE
LIKE THAT INITIALLY HAD QUITE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE PHRASE TYPES AND AND MARKATIONS AND THEN EVENTUALLY YOU CAME UP UH WITH SOME KIND OF RULES THAT YOU SET UP BETWEEN UH THE TWO OF YOU
OR
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK SO
OKAY
I DROPPED A
SO DID DERE DEREK AND BEN HAS THE UM THE FILE THAT THEY THIS MANUAL
OR
YEAH
O OKAY
OKAY RIGHT IT'S PRINTING IT OUT AS WELL
I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT LIKE UH MARKING OR NOT MARKING WHO'S TOP AND WHO'S BOTTOM
I THINK MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR YOU GUYS TO KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
OKAY FAIR ENOUGH
SO SO YOU SORRY UM JUST FOR THE CONVENTION YOU YOU YOU MARKING WHICH UH WHICH THE ANNOTATION YOU THINK IS IS THE RIGHT ONE
OKAY FAIR ENOUGH
MM-HMM OKAY
WOULD THERE BE OTHER CASES WHERE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY MARK AN AB ABSORPTION
OR
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
CHEERS
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
IS THAT THE NEBULA
WAS IT THE NEBULA THIN YEAH
UM SO SO CAN I JUST ASK W W NOW YOU JUST UH ALIGNED D UH SORRY YOU CIRCLE THE WORD IN THE IN THE OUTLINE WHICH DIDN'T
RIGHT SORRY
OK OH I SEE OKAY
MM-HMM
CHEERS
I SEE
THAT WAS EASY
THE THE
I IT IT WOULDN'T COUNT AS A SOURCE TYPE
OR
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
UM SORRY CAN WE JUST GO BACK TH UH ONE PAGE
DID DID YOU RESOLVE THE THE LI THE DIFFERENT UM SEGMENTATIONS LIKE UH THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS
OH SORRY I I THOUGHT IT WAS A PROBLEM OF LIKE UH ONE HAVING UNDERLINED THE ENTIRE OH SORRY
NO NO I I SE OKAY SORRY
YEAH I SEE
SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION TASK
SO I TH I THINK TH THERE THERE WAS ALSO THIS ONE GUIDELINE OF SAYING FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMETHING UH IS SITTING UNDER A NEGATION
RIGHT THE THERE WAS NO UM DAMPED L. Y. ALPHA SOMETHING
THEN UM WE THEN I THINK THE CONVENTION WAS THAT WE STILL THAT YOU STILL WOULD MARK THAT
RIGHT
SO IT'S MORE LIKE UH A S IT'S UH UH IT'S UH SORT OF LIKE A QUITE LITERAL TASK THAT'S REALLY LIKE FINDING THESE KIND OF UH THESE TYPES OF STRINGS UH RATHER THAN REALLY REFERRING TO THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL REALITY
WHICH I MEAN SORT OF LIKE IF IF YOU IF YOU WERE TO RESOLVE THESE KIND OF UH CASES IN ORDER TO PUT THEM SAY IN A DATABASE OR SO
THEN YOU'D PROBABLY BE RIGHT IN THIS CASE RIGHT
BUT UH TH GIVEN THAT THE KIND OF THING IS THAT THAT THIS NAMED ENTITY RECOGN TASK IS IS A MUCH IS A MUCH MORE UH LITERAL THING
LIKE REALLY JUST FIN FINDING THESE KIND OF STRINGS
I THINK IN THIS CASE UM I W I WOULD SAY THIS IS PROBABLY AN ENTITY
YEAH
UM SO UH JUST ABOUT CHANGING RULES
I MEAN IN A SENSE YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ANNOTATION THAT THAT THEY THE AGREEMENTS THAT YOU ARRIVE ON TODAY
THAT THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU DID BEFORE
RIGHT SO UH I MEAN THIS REALLY ONLY DISPLAYS UH TH THOSE CASES WHERE YOU DISAGREED
BUT IF YOU SORTA LIKE CHANGE A RULE NOW ON THE FLY THEN THAT MIGHT BE THEN THAT MIGHT B UH CREATE INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE
YEAH
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY THIS NARROW AND BROAD BAND THAT THAT REFERS TO THE TYPE OF SPECTROGRAM THAT YOU HAVE
LIKE T ON THE TYPE OF FILTER OR IS IT OH OKAY
YEAH OKAY
MM-HMM
OH WAS IT ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO DOUBLY UNDERLINE THINGS
UM
I DON'T KNOW WH WHICH ONE IT WOULD DISPLAY THEN
I I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THESE SO YOU YOU YOU ALLOWED THESE KIND OF EMBEDDED UH ANNOTATIONS
RIGHT OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD THAT'S NEARLY A THIRD
GREAT THANK YOU
YEP
SORRY MM YEP
YEAH
UH YES COURSE OF COURSE IT IS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT ALL IS YEAH I THINK IT IS ALL M ONE NAME
YEP
YEAH THESE ARE S S SPECIES IONS AGAIN NOT INDIVIDUAL LINES
IT'S NOT A COMPETITION
UH
YEAH AND THIS ONE
UM
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL IT'S ONE OF THEM OUT UM OVER HERE I THINK ACTUALLY AT THE MOMENT
SO 'CAUSE OUR SUN IS A IS A T. DWARF
MM-HMM
UH
WELL IT'S A PROCESS THOUGH ISN'T IT
ISN'T IT A PROCESS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I WOULDN'T HAVE THAT
WELL I THINK Y BU Y Y YOU CAN ACTUALLY MARK IT IF IT ISN'T ALTERING WHAT'S IN THE MANUAL
UH UM IT'S ONLY ALTERING EARLIER RULES
THAT AREN'T ALLOWED
YEAH THEN THEN DO I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
Y YEAH YEAH BUT YEAH
YEAH
JUST A P WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE THERE SORRY
YEP
ISN'T REMOTE
YEAH FINE
UM YEAH THAT'S ACTUALLY MARKED EX EXPLICITLY IN HERE NOT TO HAVE A. BAR CLUSTERS
SO YEAH
NO I I'M I'M NOT ARGUING
I AGREE YEAH
DO YOU WANT THIS ONE HERE
NO
CONTI CONTINUUM
NO OKAY
I THINK THAT'S A S SPECIES AGAIN
YEAH I THINK YOU HAVE
YEAH
WELL N I THINK I WOULD ACTUALLY LEAVE IT UM WITH ONLY TH ON THOSE
BR BROAD L
LINE IN IT
UM BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S S WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING EARLIER ON
YEAH
YEAH
NO
THE DIFFERENCE ONLY WEAK LINE ISN'T IT
OH YEAH
THERE'S A LINE THERE AS WELL
IT'S DIFFERENT
AND AN AND
DIFFERENT AS WELL
THEY JUST MADE THAT UP
THAT'S YEAH EXACTLY
THAT'S NOT A SOURCE TYPE
THAT'S WE DID EARLIER ANYWAY
SO
NO THEY JUST MADE THAT UP AS WELL
NO
THAT'S A PROCESS THOUGH
YEAH IT'S A PROCESS OR A SOURCE
I'M SORRY
YEAH
WELL HANG ON THOUGH
BUT WASN'T THERE ONE JUST A MINUTE AGO IN WHICH ONLY HAD A LINE
BUT YOU JUST
KEEPING LINES THERE
SO
ADJECTIVE
UH YES
RIGHT
OKAY OKAY
OKAY
YEAH OKAY FINE
YEAH
YEAH
THAT HAS TO GO AS WELL THEN SURELY
A STAR BURST IS A CLASS
AS IS AN A. G. N.
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
UM ARE THEY UH IF YOU SAY SO
OKAY
OKAY
WELL YOU HAVEN'T BEEN EARLIER HAVE YOU
I DON'T THINK YOU WERE
UH
HAVE YOU
OH OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
I THINK SO
UH
NO
HIGH VELOCITY CLOUDS
THERE
THAT'S RIGHT
WHY
Y YES THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
UH
REALLY
IF IT WAS
ARE YOU
N
NO
NO
NOR WEAK EMISSION THEN
NO
OH YEAH
SORRY
YEAH
NO
YEAH
YEAH
UM M UH Y YE WELL I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
BUT
HMM
THAT'S THE ACTUALLY USUALLY
BUT ANYWAY
I DON'T MIND
YEAH
I GUE I GUESS KEEP IT THEN
YEAH I THINK SO
BLENDED ION LINES YEAH
YES YOU DO MEAN ION LINES
YEAH
NO
YEAH IT'S IF IT HAS
H H
HYDROGEN OR H HELIUM IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF WHITE DWARFS
YEAH
NO THAT'S RIGHT
THAT ALL GOES
YEAH
I GUESS YOU COULD KEEP IT THEN
YEAH
BUT IT'S A REGION THOUGH ISN'T IT
YE YE
THE N. AS WELL
UH YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
WELL KIND OF IT IT'S UH UH D IF YOU HAD A S SP SPECTRUM
YOU HAVE ALL THE L LINES OF ACTUALLY LOTS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS AND YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT AT ALL THE ONES SP WHICH ARE ION LINES
THEN AFTER THAT YOU LOOK AND SAY UM HA HAS A LOT OF ION IN IT
UM
BUT B YEAH I
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S IT YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH I THINK SO
I THINK SO
YEAH
REALLY
REALLY
YOU THINK
OKAY IF YOU BOTH THINK SO
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY OKAY
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH
WELL HANG ON THOUGH BUT UM
IS IT JUST UM TO S SCRUB YOUR MECHANISM THERE
IT ISN'T UH A SPECTRAL FEATURE SUCH AS OH IT'S A PROCESS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I THINK IT'S A PROCESS MYSELF
YEAH
WELL THAT'S TRUE
THAT IS TRUE
YEAH
YEAH OKAY OKAY
I GUESS KEEP IT PROBABLY YEAH
NO THEY'VE MADE THAT ONE UP CERTAINLY
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT ONE BEFORE
NO
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH I WOULDN'T YEAH
I THINK ALL OF THAT GOES THEN DOESN'T IT
SURELY
NO
NO I DON'T THINK ANYBODY GOES
YEAH
MM NO
IT'S AN INSTRUMENT YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S IT
HURRAY
WELL VERY GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
WE'RE DONE
RIGHT
SMILE FOR THE CAMERA
HELIUM ONE
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BREAK FOR AND
BUT I THINK MAYBE THAT ONE SHOULD BE UNDERLINED
HELIUM
M. B. D. A. PRESUMABLY IS LAMBDA
AND THE IN THAT CASE
YEP
YEP
RIGHT WHAT'S DIFFERENT
JUST THIS
HIGH EXCITATION EMISSION LINES
I THINK HIGH EXCITATION SHOULD BE IN BECAUSE IT'S JUST SAYING
IT'S TALKING ABOUT THE SPECIES THAT THE EMISSION LINES ARE COMING FROM
LIVING UP IN NEBULOSITY
ESO I DON'T THINK IS AN INSTRUMENT
OKAY
TO NOT YES TO KEEP HUBBLE
UM FOR THIS THAT SHOULD BE GREEN AS WELL
WELL IT IS THE WHOLE NAME YES I GET
ABSORPTION LINE SYSTEMS SHOULDN'T BE THERE
ABSORPTION LINE SYSTEMS
AND AGAIN
NEEDS COLUMN DENSITIES WHICH IS A DERIVED PROPERTY
BUT THEN
MM-HMM
AND LYMAN ALPHA CLOUD SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE EITHER
RIGHT
NO
FOR SOME REASON I SEEM TO HAVE JUST DIED ON THIS ONE
HE GOT BORED
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
YES
I'VE LABELLED THAT WRONG
AND HERE AGAIN
UM IT IS
BUT IS EMISSION LINE A. G. N. A SEPARATE CLASS FROM A. G. N.
I DON'T THINK IT IS
I THINK A. G. N.
YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'D PARTICULARLY CLASS THEM AS A SEPARATE SOURCE
A SEPARATE SOURCE CLASS
MAYBE YOU WOULD
MM I DIDN'T IT I JUST LOOKED AT THE PLU
AND I GUESS THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UH AN A. G. N. WITH EMISSION LINES AND ONE WITHOUT ESP ESPECIALLY IF IT'S X. RAY DETECTED
SO YEAH I'M HAPPY WITH THAT AS LONG AS THAT'S RED AS WELL WHICH IT IS
UM
NO
OH GALACTIC STARS
I THINK YOU'RE R YOU'RE RIGHT AGAIN THERE
G. DWARF
PRESUMABLY
NEVER MET ONE BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
RIGHT
OH IS IT
THERE YOU GO
AND CLUSTER YOU'RE RIGHT
ABSORPTION
BUT IT'S THE SAME LYMAN ALPHA FOREST SYSTEMS AGAIN
SO YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
OR THERE MAYBE THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY YEAH I THINK SHOULD STILL BE ABSORPTION
RADIO LOUD QUASAR AGAIN
YOU'RE RIGHT
I SHOULD DEFINITELY NOW WE HAD A DEBATE ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHY I DECIDED TO MARK ASSOCIATED
UM WHAT DOES IT MEAN
WHAT IS AS ASSOCIATED ABSORPTION
DOESN'T SAY IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT
I DON'T KNOW
I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS
YEAH
RIGHT OKAY
SO IS THAT WHAT IT MEANS IN THAT C CONTEXT
RIGHT
UM AND ASSOCIATED AGAIN
MECHANISMS
QUASAR
AND WE SHOULD'VE S PUT EMISSION LINE FEATURES SHOULDN'T WE
BUT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO MARK THINGS WE'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY
SO
WE'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT N UND UNDERLINING FEATURES
IT DOESN'T SAY IN THE MANUAL ABOUT FEATURES OR NOT BUT WE D WHEN WE SAW ONES PREVIOUSLY WE MARKED FEATURES
UM YES
THE ONLY PROBLEM IT'S DONE IF WE'VE BOTH BEEN NOT MARKING IT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER INSTANCES IN THE TEXT WHERE IT'S NOT MARKED
MM-HMM
RIGHT OKAY
YEAH
YES WE'VE GOT QUASARS
AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS LAST ONE
SYSTEMS
I. M. GALAXIES
IS IT
OKAY
HUBBLE DEEP FIELDS IS BEING MARKED
AND ABSORPTION SHOULDN'T BE MARKED YEP
I DON'T THINK ABLE CLUSTER IS DIFFERENT FROM CLUSTER
HMM
AN ABLE CLUSTER IS JUST A A DISCOVER
YEAH
SOFT EXCESS
YEP OKAY WE CAN HAVE SOFT EXCESS
MM-HMM
AND YES YOU'RE WRONG 'CAUSE THAT'S YOU'RE RIGHT 'CAUSE THAT'S EXTENDED EMISSION AND COMPTON EMISSION
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON BOTH OF THEM
UM X. RAY B. L. X. AND RADIO B. L. X. I THINK ARE BECAUSE THE B. L. WITHIN SHOULD BE MARKED SO
NO CONTINUUM
C. O. LUMINOSITY
MM-HMM
OH IT'S STILL TOO HOT
UM
INTERMEDIATE IS A REGION
IT SHOULDN'T BE HIGHLIGHTED YOU'RE RIGHT
BECAUSE IF IF WE TALK ABOUT THE BROAD LINE REGION WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HIGHLIGHT IT
IT'S THE SAME IT'S JUST IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR BEFORE THE SO CALLED
UM
YEAH JUST GALAXIES
STAR BURSTS
YES THEY DO
OH
YES ASSUMING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STAR BURST GALAXIES RATHER THAN STAR BURST WITHIN A GALAXY
BUT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT STAR BURST GALAXIES
AND GALAXIES
MM CONTINUA OR CONTINUUM FLUX
IT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THAT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
BUT WHAT DID WE DECIDE
LET'S KEEP FLUX IN BECAUSE IT IN MOST OF THESE CASES WE'VE PUT FLUX IN
AND THE SAME AS FEATURE
BROAD LINE
I WAS GONNA SAY PUT IT IN
UM THE LACK OF BROAD LINE POLARIZATION
BROAD LINE POLARIZATION IS THAT A SPECTRAL FEATURE
I THINK YOU'D WANT THE WHOLE THING IN SOME EXTENT
TS YOU CAN'T GET IT JUST FROM A SPECTRUM
BUT YOU CAN IF YOU'VE GOT A SPECTRUM THAT'S SPLIT BY POLARIZED LIGHT
AS IT IS
POLARIZATION'S A PROPERTY
YES OKAY
YEP
NOW I D DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS MARKED HERE
HAVE YOU GOT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE
OR IS IT CUT OFF
NO
I SAID THAT WEAK LINE WAS
BECAUSE THE MODIFIER SHOULD BE INCLUDED WHICH I THINK IT SHOULD
EVEN THOUGH WE CLAIM RADIO GALAXIES I THIS SHOULD BE UNDERLINED
THIS SHOULD BE GREEN
OH RIGHT OKAY
ARE WE THE SAME ON THE BOTTOM LINE
OKAY SO THE QUESTION IS OH NO IT'S DIFFERENT
OH I'VE GOT LINE THAT'S FINE
LINE COMES OUT AND AND SHOULD COME OUT AS WELL
SO THERE'S A RIGHT BUT I THINK WEAK LINE SHOULD BE IN
BEC I IN THE SAME WAY THAT IF YOU HAD BROAD LINE IT WOULD BE IN THERE
RIGHT
YES
MM OKAY
UM LINE AGAIN
BUT WE'VE GOT EMISSION LINE IN THE RATIOS
THAT'S FINE
INFRARED GALAXIES
THAT'S RIGHT AGAIN
OH NO IS IT
NO IT'S WRONG
YEAH
I'LL GET THIS
LINE
AND THAT'S IT
MAKING EMISSION FEATURE WHICH WE'RE INCLUDING NOW
MM-HMM
STAR FORMING GALAXIES
NO WE CAN'T
STAR FORMING GALAXIES SHOULD BE IN
YEAH
PROTO GALACTIC LUMP
W NOT GONNA GET AWAY WITH THAT ONE
IT'S A LUMP
IT'S SOMETHING
EMISSION FEATURE AGAIN
DAMP LYMAN
THAT SHOULD BE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN ABSORBER IT'S AN ABSORPTION
OH COVERS YEAH
YEAH YOU CROSS 'EM OUT
FEATURES
A FEATURE AGAIN
IS A FEATURE A SPECTRAL FEATURE
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHAS AGAIN
YEAH
AFTER AND THE REST IS THE SAME
NOW A LINE SHOULD BE IN
X. RAY B. L.
INTERMEDIATE
WE PUT IN TYPE TYPE ONE POINT NINE
YES I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN
MM-HMM
OH GOSH THIS LOOKS COMPLICATED
OH IT'S JUST IT'S LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION
AND WE DON'T LIKE THAT ONE
AND WE DON'T LIKE THAT ONE
YES WE ARE TAKING OUT LINE ON ITS OWN
SO WE HA YES
EVERY TIME
YES I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE IN GENERAL EVERY TIME THERE'S BEEN LINE WHERE'S THERE BEEN LINE
OKAY IT'S LINE WIDTH BUT IT'S ST IT'S STILL WHERE IT SAYS LINES
HAVE WE HAD ANY JUST WHERE IT SAYS LINE RATIOS
MM
YES I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
NO
WE WANT THE WHOLE THING IN THERE
OR IN THE U. V.
I DON'T THINK SPECTRUM SHOULD BE THERE
BUT IF IT'S A WAVE LENGTH OR A WAVE BAND WE WERE PUTTING IT IN
YEAH
YEP YOU'RE RIGHT
LINE CENTRE YOU CAN POINT TO
NOT LIKE LINE WIDTH BUT YOU CAN POINT TO LINE CENTRE
IN FACT THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED I THINK
YOU CAN POINT TO THE LINE WINGS
MM THAT'S JUST A
YEP NO THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
MM YOU'RE RIGHT STAR BURST
OH STAR BURST ACTIVE STAR BURST LIKE ACTIVITY THAT'S I DON'T THINK THAT'S A CLASS
IT'S A ACTION
BUT A. G BUT A AN A. AN A. G. N. IS A CLASS
A STAR BURST IS A TYPE OF GALAXY BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHIN A GALAXY
IT'S
BUT AN A. G. N. IS AN OBJECT
THE STAR BURST YOU CAN'T SAY HERE IS A STAR BURST
CAN'T STAR BURST IF IT MEANS GALAXY
IF THIS MEANS STAR BURST GALAXY LIKE ACTIVITY THEN THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH
BUT STAR BURST REFERS TO
MM
I CAN SEE THAT
MM-HMM
OKAY
LET'S KEEP IT IN
I I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ANYWAY
MM-HMM
YES I THINK IT WAS MA MAYBE IF IT WAS STAR FORMING LIKE ACTIVITY THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
BUT YEAH
YES THAT'S RIGHT BUT STAR BURST IS DIFFERENT
OKAY
UM WE'VE JUST GOT THIS SPLIT UP
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE W H.
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S TWO
IT'S A WAVE LENGTH REGION BUT IT'S TILT BUT YOU'RE SAYING BETWEEN THAT LINE AND THAT LINE
UM
YOU ARE YES
THAT'S ALL PART OF THE NAME
LINE RATIOS
BUT GALAXY SHOULD BE IN
SO WE NEED TO WRITE THAT
UM HOLD ON
OH NO THEY ARE THE SAME
SORRY I MISSED THAT
ABSORPTION LINE SYSTEMS
HUBBLE
AND HUBBLE
AND GALAXY
GALAXY DISTRIBUTION
STILL THE DISTRIBUTION OF GALAXIES
UM HIGH IONIZATION LINES
YES
MM-HMM
OPEN THAT RADIUS BUTTON
YES DON'T INCLUDE PLATT'S SPECTRUM
QUASARS
LOW IONIZATION
MM BUT THREE SHOULD BE IN
UM LOW IONIZATION TH THEY'RE LOW BALS AREN'T THEY
LOW BAL IS A SEPARATE CLASS OF SOURCE
UM I I DON'T KNOW IF HIGH BALS ARE BUT LOW BALS ARE
OH RIGHT YEAH
YEAH
I SHOULDN'T YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
EMISSION LINE CANDIDATES
YES YOU'RE RIGHT
CONTINUUM I THINK SHOULD BE IN AREN'T THEY
ALTHOUGH I WAS TALKING ABOUT CONTI YEAH CONTINUUM LUMINOSITY CONTINUUM FLUX IT SHOULD BE IN
I THOUGHT WE HAD WE'D PUT IN
MM-HMM
YEAH WE WEREN'T DOING BROAD BAND DETECTIONS
WE WERE DOING YEAH
THIS IS NICE TEA
NOW WHAT WERE WE DOING IF
IT
AND WHAT WERE WE DOING
UM
I DON'T KNOW 'CAUSE YOU IN LANGUAGE SPEAK MARK EACH AS A SEPARATE ENTITY
THAT'S DIFFERENT
MARK SUB SECTIONS OF ENTITIES T NO THAT'S DIFFERENT
DOESN'T REALLY SAY
SO WE NEED A RULE FOR THAT
WHAT HAVE WE DONE T
Z. EQUALS TWO
YEAH
AS ONE OKAY
LET'S WHATEVER'S EASIEST FOR YOU
Y UM YES TAKE IT OUT
ISN'T IT
THE SPECTRAL COMPONENTS
X. RAY BINARIES
HUBBLE DEEP FIELD AGAIN
EMISSION LINE OBJECTS SHOULDN'T BE IN EITHER OF THEM
RADIO QUIET QUASAR SHOULD BE GO MM
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT
NOW YOU'VE DONE ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
AND YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE ONE'S LINE FORMATION AND ONE'S LINE PROFILE
I. G. M. I'VE DONE AGAIN
THIS IS NICE AND EASY
COMPONENTS
UM
MM-HMM
BUT WE WANT THE LINE STILL
THE GALAXY OR GALAXY
GIVEN THAT IT IS THE GALAXY
IT SHOULD BE THE GALAXY I GUESS
INSERT PROPER WHATEVER THE WORD IS
H. V. C. IS IT THIS
KNOWN TO LIE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIGH VELOCITY CLOUDS
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE
THEY SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
YES BUT THEY DON'T EXPLAIN
I. C. M.
SCUBA
SOMETIMES ANYWAY WHEN IT WORKS
UM
NO BUT NO YOU'RE RIGHT AND THIS SHOULD BE RED AS WELL
IT SHOULD ALL BE
NARROW LINE A. G. N. ARE DIFFERENT
I MISSED OUT THAT
H. BETA L WIDTH
SO
JUST KEEP H. BETA I THINK
GIVEN THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING LINE WIDTH ITSELF
EVEN LINE IF IT IS LINE WIDTH
YOU CAN HAVE FLUX
H. BETA SHOULD BE IN
NOT THAT LINE BUT WE WANT ENHANCED
WE WE WANTED AND THIS IS RELATIVE WE WANTED MODIFIERS OF MODIFIERS OF SPECTRAL LINES E. G. WEAK BROAD LINES
I WEAK W RELATIVE TO WHAT THOUGH
IT'S ALL RELATIVE BUT IT'S STILL A MODIFIER OF THAT LINE
AND THE SAME
UM
NO ONLY WHEN IT'S EMBEDDED
OH BUT THE SECOND ONE
OH IT'S INCLUDED BESIDE MARK IT ALL AS ONE ENTITY YES
YES I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE MISSED THE
UM WEAK EMISSION I THINK SHOULD BE IN THERE
MM
IF WE'RE INCLUDING IT EMISSION
UM
NO THAT'S TRUE SO WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE EITHER OF THOSE
BUT THEN WEAK YEAH OKAY NOTHING AT ALL
THAT'S NOT A SEPARATE SOURCE
RED CONTINUUM SHOULD BE IN
BROAD LINE EMISSION AND THE REST FRAME U. V. SHOULD ALL BE ONE
YOU'RE RIGHT YEAH
OH
NO IT SHOULDN'T
OH YES SORRY YOU'RE RIGHT
LINES
YES THAT'S TRUE
ASSOCIATED AGAIN WHICH MEANS NOTHING
CONTINUUM SOURCE SHOULDN'T BE IN
AND ASSOCIATED SHOULDN'T BE IN
C. T. I. I. O.
WHAT DOES IT STAND FOR
THAT IS A SEPARATE THING
Y YEAH
YES BUT IT'S ALSO A TELESCOPE AND I THINK HE IF THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OF DESCRIBING IT THAT TELESCOPE
THE C. T. I. O. FOUR METRE TELESCOPE IS MUST BE WHAT IT'S CALLED
OTHERWISE THEY'D CALL IT A NAME
UM
WE'RE INCLUDING OBSERVATORY IF IT REFERS
IF IT'S PART OF THE PROPER NAME OF AN INSTRUMENT
YES UP THE TELESCOPE
NO JUST FOUR METRE
ION SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
OH NO IT SHOULD
IRON AND ABSORPTION
IS IT CONTAMINATION FROM BLENDED IRON AND ABSORPTION LINES
NO IT'S NOT
IT'S NO IT'S NOT
I IF THE COMMA WASN'T THERE IT WOULD BE IN
SO THEY DO MEAN IRON LINE
SO SO IT SHOULD BE IN
AND WE'RE KEEPING LINE IN 'CAUSE ITS STRENGTHS YEAH
CONTINUUM FLUX WE SHOULD HAVE ALL IN
G OH
THERE'RE GONNA BE HUNDREDS OF THOSE
LEAST IT'S QUICK
UM
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A SEPARATE CLASS OF QUASAR
BUT THEN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT QUASARS
I THINK IT SHOULD P
YEAH
THAT'S OKAY
UM THE A. W. D. S
MM WHITE DWARF
UM
OKAY SO IT IS A DIFFERENT CLASS
OKAY
NOPE
LOW BAL
MM I'D PUT MULTIPLE IN THERE
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO COMPONENTS
I SAY NEITHER OF THEM
OR YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
NO ABSORPTION LINES
THAT SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED
OH SORRY I'M I ME
YEAH I DON'T THIN I DON'T THINK THERE WAS S BUT
MM ONLY IF IT'S AN ASTRO PHYSICALLY DISTINCT DISTINCT
OKAY
NO ABSORPTION LINES SHOULD BE IN AND THE SAME HERE
I DIDN'T
NICE NOT TO DO ASSOCIATED FOR ONCE
I YOU'RE
Y YES YOU SHOULDN'T
AND WE W OH GOSH WHAT WERE WE GONNA TO DO ABOUT A. AND AGAIN
YES YOU ARE RIGHT YEAH
STRONG SOFT X. RAY FLUX
YEAH YOU CAN POINT TO THAT
AND THAT'S ASSOCIATED ABSORPTION LINES
AND ABSORPTION AND SMALL CLOUDS IS OUT
AH NOW THIS IS THE CONJUNCT RULE AGAIN
AND I'VE DONE BLUE WINGS OF THIS AND THIS AND THIS
AND THIS IS ONE DOUBLE LINE
AND THIS
AND PRESUMABLY THAT'S RED THERE
IT GOES OVER THERE
I THINK I IF THE LINE'S TOO LONG Y YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED ALL I AS ONE
BUT AND I'VE HIGHLIGHTED IT SEPARATELY
IT SHOULD BE SEPARATE
I THINK IF THE LINE'S TOO LONG
IT'S ONLY HA PUTTING THE BOTTOM LINE BECAUSE OLIVIA WOULD'VE MARKED FROM BLUE ALL THE WAY TO THE END AS ONE LONG LINE
YES BUT I THINK IT PROBABLY WAS AND JUST HASN'T PRINTED BECAUSE OLIVIA WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED MARKING AT FOURTEEN O. TWO
ALMO TWO LINES ABOVE
YEAH BUT I THINK IT'S JUST M MISSING OUT THE PRINTING IF THE LINE GOES OVER THE END
'CAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT YOU LOOK AT WHAT OLIVIA'S DONE HERE OLIVIA WOULDN'T HAVE JUST HIGHLIGHTED THAT LINE
SHE WOULD HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE WHOLE THING
YEAH AND IT'S JUST HASN'T PRINTED THAT
BUT IT IS MARKED I THINK
MM-HMM
SHOULDN'T BE
BUT IT'S AL IS THAT ALSO THE NAME OF THE SOURCE
SO IT SHOULD BE THIS ONE PLUS THE PINK
LINE BROADNESS AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE IN
THAT'S TRUE
WELL OKAY YEAH
SO WE'VE BEEN IN HERE
ALRIGHT
MY TABLE FOR NOW
RICH IRON SPECTRUM
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
TO THE FEATURE OF THE SPECTRUM
DOES THAT MAKE IT A SPECTRAL FEATURE
UM
IT'S A FEATURE OF THE WHOLE SPECTRUM RATHER THAN YOU CAN'T SAY THERE IS A RICH IRON SPECTRUM YOU CAN SAY THIS IS A RICH IRON SPECTRUM
YES IT'S NOT A SPECTRAL FEATURE
IT'S FEATURE OF THE SPECTRUM WHICH IS DIFFERENT
YES
AND THEN WITH THE SAME
GOSH WE'RE GETTING THROUGH THIS NOW
UM GIANT ELLIPTICALS OR ELLIPTICALS
WE WERE INCLU ARE YOU NOT
THEY ARE SEPARATE BUT ARE THEY A SEPARATE CLASS
I THINK THEY PROBABLY ARE IN THE ETA B. T. G. S AND THINGS
IONIZED EMISSION
YES I THINK YOU WANT IONIZED IN THERE
YOU CAN POINT TO IONIZED EMISSION RATHER THAN
HMM
EMISSION FROM HIGH EXCITATION LINES
YEAH
IT IT'S POINTING THERE AND SAYING LOOK THERE'S A HIGH EXCITATION EMISSION
AND THERE'S NOT HIGH EXCITATION
K
MM-HMM
LINE RATIO
WHAT'S DIFFERENT THERE
OH THERE YES
NARROW LINE SEYFERT ONE SHOULD ALL BE ONE
WITH THE RED INSIDE IT
THAT
YEAH
IT'S DESCRIBING THE LINE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
WE'VE INCLUDED IT BEFORE WHEN YOU'VE SAID THIS HAS BEEN DETECTED
FROM I THINK SHOULD BE IN THERE
E EMISSION LINES
QUASARS I MISSED
DAMPED LYMAN ALSO IS NOT SYSTEMS YEAH
MM NO I THINK IT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE
YOU CAN POINT TO THE DAMPED LYMAN A ALPHA RESORPTION IN IN THE SAME WAY YOU CAN POINT TO H. BETA EMISSION
ALTHOUGH H. BETA EMISSION IS A PROCESS
OR EMISSION FROM H. BETA IS IS A PROCESS
NO THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION SYSTEMS WE CROSSED OUT
WE ALSO CROSSED OUT
WHAT DID WE DO BACK
MM YOU CAN POINT TO LOW RED SHIFT DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION 'CAUSE YOU'RE SHIFTED IN THE SPECTRUM THERE
UM
WOULD IT BE IF IT WAS H. BETA ABSORPTION
AND YOU JUST TOOK OUT THE LOW RED SHIFTS
QUASARS WITH H. BETA ABSORPTION YOU'D PUT IN
BECAUSE IT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE
I THINK DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION
I THINK IT'S BOTH
BECAUSE WE'VE EVERY FEATURE IS PRODUCED BY A PROCESS
YES IT'S DEPENDS WHETHER IT HAS T WHETHER IT MEANS WITH LOW RED SHIFT DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA CLOUD ABSORPTION
IF IT WAS DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORBERS THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
BUT I THINK ABSORPTION
IT'S A PROCESS BUT IT ALSO PRODUCES A SPECTRAL FEATURE WHERE YOU CAN SAY THERE'S THE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION
THERE'S THE IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE YEAH H. BETA EMISSION IS A PROCESS
YEAH I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN THERE
MICRO QUASARS
THEY'RE DUBBED MICRO QUASARS
IS IT GONNA BE A DECENT SOURCE TYPE IN THE FUTURE
I HAVEN'T HEARD REFERRED TO SINCE
BUT
BUT JUST TALK ABOUT THE MICRO QUASAR
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THEY HAVE MA
MM ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE'RE HAVING HYPER LUMINOUS GALAXIES WHERE YOU KNOW THEY'VE JUST GOT ULTRA LUMINOUS AND OH EVEN MORE HYPER LUMINOUS
WELL SOMEONE MUST HAVE MADE THAT UP FOR THE FIRST TIME
I THINK
SAME AS A HYPER LUMINOUS GALAXY BEING VERY VERY EXTREME
I RECKON A DWARF AMORPHOUS NUCLEI STAR BURST GALAXY A DANCE IS A YEAH OKAY
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ACRONYM BECAUSE THAT'S HAS THAT SHOULD BE IN
STAR BURST NUCLEI
YOU'RE RIGHT
OH
THE OBJECT
IF IT WAS STAR BURST GALAXIES IT WOULD BE IN THERE
STAR BURST NUCLEI REFERS TO A REGION WITHIN AN OBJECT WHICH WOULD NOT BE OBSERVED SEPARATELY
UM
OKAY
BECAUSE THE ACRONYM HAS STAR BURST IN IT UH GALAXIES IN IT IN THE S. AND IF THE ACRONYM INCLUDES ITS
THEN IT HAS TO BE IN THERE
CONTINUUM FLUX YOU CAN HAVE
U. V. AND OPTICAL EMISSION LINE RATIOS
BUT
U. V. AND OPTICAL EMI U. V. AND OPTICAL EMISSION SHOULD BE IN THERE THOUGH
NO IT SHOULDN'T 'CAUSE IT IT MODIFIES THE RATIOS
OH GOSH NO EMISSION L OKAY SO I'VE HIGHLIGHTED THIS IN R RED AND THEN THE WHOLE THING IN GREEN BECAUSE TYPE TWO SEYFART GALAXIES ARE ONE
SO I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AS LONG AS THIS IS
T. V. GAMMA RAY EMISSION
WE WEREN'T DOING BROAD BAND DETECTIONS YEAH
USING THE
IT IS YES
VERY STUPID BUT IT IS
F. B. S. OBJECTS SHOULDN'T BE IN THERE
I DON'T KNOW BUT IT'S GOT OBJECT
AND THE MAMA SCANNING MACHINE IS AN INSTRUMENT IT'S NOT A TELESCOPE IT'S AN INSTRUMENT
OH YES IT SHOULD BE
NARROW EMISSION LINES FROM HIGH IRON YEAH
ABSORPTION FEATURES
WEAK CONTINUUM
THAT SHOULD BE SEPARATE
CONTINUUM RADIATION
NEITHER
MM-HMM
YEP
OH THERE'S EMISSION FROM THE NARROW LINE REGION YEAH
NARROW LINE EMISSION SHOULD BE IN
F. V. LOW BAL IS A SOURCE TYPE
STUPID KECKERS
YOU USED TO B OH NO KECK OBSERVATORY
YES WE DID DECIDE KECK WAS GOING IN
AT ALL YEP
AND WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW EMISSION
RADIO QUASARS
YEAH
OH NO RADIO LOUD AND RADIO QUIET ARE
YEAH
MM-HMM
UM
YE I THINK THEY'RE A SEPARATE CLASS YES
WE'RE NOT PUTTING THEM IN SPECTRAL BUT I THINK WE ARE PUTTING THEM IN BECAUSE IT'S SO BROAD BAND
BUT YES THEY ARE SEPARATE
NO YOU CAN'T POINT TO IT YEAH
MISSED GROUP
SUBARU TELESCOPE YOU'RE RIGHT
IT'S UNDER A PROPER NAME 'CAUSE IT'S GOT A CAPITAL T.
WONDERFUL
WELL ONCE WE'VE GOT THEM IDENTIFIED A LOT OF THEM WERE THE SAME PROBLEM GOING ROUND AND ROUND
UM WHERE'S THE BIN IN HERE
AND MORE TO THE POINT CAN I GET TO IT WITHOUT GOING AH I CAN CARRY MY LITTLE BITS IN THE WITH ME
EXCUSE ME CAMERA I NEED TO FIND THE BIN
UM AND THERE ISN'T ONE IS THERE
HELLO
RIGHT
MM MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS
THAT'S THIS IS A BIT OF H. T. M. L. GOO
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BREAK FOR AND
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE H. T. M. L. GOO
BUT THIS THIS ISN'T A S YEAH
AND THIS ISN'T A SEPARATE THING SO I W I WOULD AGREE THAT YOU UNDERLINE THE YOU UNDERLINE THE GOO IN EACH CASE BUT NOT THE AND
RIGHT
YEAH
OKAY
MM MM-HMM
MM
YES
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT YOU DON'T GET THAT
ESO ISN'T AN INSTRUMENT
YOU'RE RIGHT
WE AGREED FOR TO KEEP HUBBLE
YEP
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE A SOURCE TYPE YEAH
IT'S
YEAH DO YOU THINK THAT'S PART OF THE NAME YEAH
I DON'T YEAH I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING YEAH
YEP
YEP
RIGHT
MM YEAH
YEP THAT'S FINE
NOPE
I WIN
UH
OKAY
YEAH I KNOW
IS THERE A PRIZE AT THE END
BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
UM OKAY
MM THAT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE THAT'S OKAY
YE
EMISSION LINE A. G. N.
YOU CAN GET A. G. N. WITHOUT EMISSION LINES
I THINK IN PHIL'S PAPER HE DOES DOESN'T HE
THE PAPER I POINTED YOU TO A FEW WEEKS AGO OR LAST WEEK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANT BUT YES
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEM AS SEPARATE CLASSES BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
YEAH
YEP
OH
MM 'KAY
YEAH THAT G. DWARFS ARE THINGS AREN'T THEY
THAT'S ALRIGHT YEAH
I SAW IT YESTERDAY
UH YEAH
THERE HE IS
BY LYMAN ALPHA FOREST AND LYMAN LIMIT SYSTEMS
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
EMISSION MODELS DEFINITELY NOT
UM WHY ASSOCIATED
YEAH
IT MEANS IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SOME PHYSICAL THING BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SPECTRAL FEATURES I DON'T THINK
DOES IT
MM-HMM
I'M HAPPY TO SAY M. TWO WHAT NOT ABSORPTION IS A SPECTRAL FEATURE
BUT ASSOCIATED MEANS IT'S ASSOCIATED TO SOME PHYSICAL THING
SO YEAH
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN
ALRIGHT
YEP
THOSE ARE MECHANISMS
SO THEY DON'T COUNT
DON'T THINK
UM
YEP I JUST MISSED IT
AND THAT'S IT
HMM
YEAH WE SHOULD DO
YEAH WE DID THAT THE SAME
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING
YEAH
YEAH AND IT'S NOT IN THE MANUAL IS IT
YEAH
SO LET'S DO THAT
EXTEND
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
YEP
IT'S A KIND OF A REGULAR GALAXY
MM-HMM
YEAH
RI RIGHT
THAT DEFINITELY GETS TO GO IN
THAT'S NOT A COMPONENT
I THINK
YEAH WE COULD COME TO BLOWS OVER SOFT EXCESS
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
I AGREE
THAT'S FINE
NO
NO FOR CONTINUUM
UM
YEAH THAT'S FINE
UH I CAN AGREE WITH TAKING THAT OUT
THAT THE SO CALLED YEAH I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE SHOULD IT
'CAUSE IT'S A REGION YEAH
YEP
YEAH IT'S BADLY WRITTEN
INFRARED GALAXIES
WE SAID NOT TO MARK THINGS BASED SOLELY ON
SO IT'S JUST DEFINED ONLY BY WAVE LENGTH
SO WE CAN'T INCLUDE INFRARED GALAXIES
AND
STAR BURSTS COUNT SURELY
MM YES YEAH THEY ARE
GALAXIES
MM
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
I'D SAY CONTINUUM FLUX BUT I DON'T OBVIOUSLY
BUT I DON'T CARE
YEP OKAY
MM-HMM
MM NO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT OUT
OH
MM NO YOU CAN'T POINT TO IT
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
MM
UH WE'RE MISSING WEAK WEAK LINE
OKAY YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT
OH
YEAH NO YOU'VE GOT LINE IN THERE
M
AND SHOULD COME OUT
OKAY MM-HMM
YEP THAT'S OKAY
GALACTIC BLACK HOLE CANDIDATES
YEAH
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT'S A SOURCE TYPE
MM MM-HMM
YEP
NO IT'S NOT RIGHT
RIGHT
UH LINE EMITTING GAS I DON'T LIKE YEAH
FAR INFRARED GALAXIES WE CAN'T HAVE
THAT'S OKAY
YEAH THAT'S OKAY
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA ABSORPTION THE SAME
RIGHT YEP
EMISSION FEATURE
YEAH THAT CAN'T BE IN
YEP
UH YES IT SHOULD BE
YEP THAT SHOULD BE IN
THAT IS NOT A SOURCE TYPE
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
YEAH
DIBULAE ABSORPTION
NO BUT IT SAYS IT COVERS A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALL ANGULAR SIZE
IT'S A PHYSICAL THING
YEP
UH THIS FEATURE
YEAH OKAY
ALPHA
YEAH YOU DON'T GET THAT
DO YOU
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE REGIONS GLOBS NEBULAE
YEP
YEAH
X. RAY B. L. LAX
YEP THAT'S OKAY
INTERMEDIATE TYPES
IT NOW IF WE'RE D
DID WE IN THE END
YEAH
OH RIGHT
YOU GET IT THEN
THAT DOESN'T GO IN AND THAT'S OKAY
RIGHT THAT'S OKAY
WE DON'T LIKE SYSTEMS
YEAH THAT'S OKAY
ARE WE
OKAY YEP
WHAT LINE ARE WE TAKING OUT
LINE WIDTH YEAH
LINE RATIOS
WE'VE BEEN TAKING OUT LINE AS A
WORD THAT RELATES TO OTHER WORDS
MY HEAD IS GOING YEAH
BUT LINES ARE STILL LINES
YEAH THAT'S OKAY
RIGHT I AGREE THAT THAT CAN GO OUT 'CAUSE THAT'S A FITTING THING
ABSORPTION FEATURES IN THE U. V. SPECTRA
OKAY
IT'S LIKELY ONE SPECTRUM IN THE U. V. WHICH YOU CAN SEE ABSORPTION FEATURES IN
UH RIGHT
QUASARS QUASARS
UH-HUH
YEAH I'M RIGHT
AND HERE I THINK I'M RIGHT AGAIN
LINE CENTRE
YEAH YOU'D YOU'D SAY LINE WINGS
ALRIGHT YOU GET IT
RIGHT YOU WIN
UM ECLIPSING I DON'T THINK
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
Y YEAH BUT THEN THE A. G. N. LIKE ACTIVITY
SO BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO GO
A STAR BURST IS A CLASS
AN A. G. N.
BUT WE'RE COUNTING STAR BURSTS AS STAR BURST GALAXIES
NO BUT A STAR BURST GALAXY IS ONLY A GALAXY WHICH HAS A STAR BURST IN IT
LIKE AN A. G. AN ACTIVE GALAXY IS JUST A GALAXY WITH AN A. G. N. IN IT
YEAH
I THINK THEY'RE THE SAME
THEY EITHER HAVE TO BOTH STAY OR BOTH GO AND I I THINK THEY SHOULD STAY
YEAH
STAR FORMATION WE WEREN'T PUTTING IN
THAT
OR WAS IT'S A WAVE LENGTH REGION
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
I'M RIGHT HERE
THAT'S PART OF A NAME YEAH
MM 'KAY
INFRARED GALAXIES
THIS TIME YOU HAVE IT
BUT GALAXIES SHOULD BE IN
RIGHT
UH OH WHAT HAVE WE DONE
HUBBLE
YEAH OK I IN THE GALAXY DISTRIBUTION
YEAH OKAY
MM
YEAH WE DID IT BEFORE
YEAH THAT'S OKAY
OH
YEAH OKAY
WE WEREN'T DOING SPECTRAL SHAPES WERE WE
YEAH THAT COUNTS
MM-HMM
WELL
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
THAT COUNTS
THEY ARE AND IT'S A BIG JOKE
HIGH BALLS
UH YEAH
UM NEXT
YEAH
YEAH THAT DOESN'T GO IN
THAT MEANS OBJECTS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AND MAYBE AT A PARTICULAR RED SHIFT BASED ON IT
YEAH
THAT DOESN'T COUNT
MM CONTINUUM LUMINOSITIES
I DON'T REMEMBER ABOUT LUMINOSITIES
WE'VE BEEN PUTTING IN CONTINUUM FLUX
YEAH
MM
MINE TOO
OH
RADIO LOUD QUASAR SHOULD BE IN Z. EQUALS TWO SHOULDN'T
THE RULE WAS TO LEAVE IT IN WAS IT
YEAH THAT'S FOR THINGS MARKED WITH AND
YEAH IT DOESN'T SAY
Z. EQUALS TWO IS UM MEANS AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE
UM SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN BUT RADIO LOUD QUASARS IS A THING
SO IT'S WHETHER TO INCLUDE THE Z. EQUALS TWO IN THE
YEAH
OH
NO
YEAH
NO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM NO WE CAN'T HAVE THAT
YEP
A SOURCE TYPE
YEAH
OH
YEAH
UM RIGHT
YES
UM YEAH
YEAH
WE CAN RID OF THAT CAN'T WE
GALAXY WITH THE GALAXY
IT SHOULD BE THE GALAXY YEAH
H. V. C. COMPLEXES
I DON'T KNOW WHAT H. V. C. STANDS FOR BUT SINCE THEY'RE COMPLEXES WE CAN CROSS IT OUT
HUH
DO YOU KNOW WHAT H. V. C. STANDS FOR
YEAH THAT DOESN'T COUNT
MM-HMM
SCUBA THAT'S AN INSTRUMENT
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
SHOULD BE THIS AND IT PROBABLY IS THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THAT MEANS
OH I SEE
YEAH
RIGHT
BETA LINE
I DON'T THINK THAT MATTERS VERY MUCH
OKAY
HURRAY
UM OH BETA YEP
MM NO
DO WE
BUT ENHANCED RELATIVE TO WHAT
OKAY
BUT WHEN YEAH
OH I DON'T THINK I WAS DOING THAT
YEAH I'VE MISSED THAT A LOT
YEAH
OKAY
OH YEAH EXTENDED EMISSION IS EXTENDED
WE WE'VE NOT BEEN INCLUDING EXTENDED EMISSION
SO
YEAH
WEAK EMISSION LEVELS IS JUST A WAY OF SAYING YEAH I AGREE
DONE
STAR BURST CONTRIBUTION
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
RED CONTINUUM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE OUT
WE WEREN'T DOING COMPONENTS
SO
YEAH THIS IS THIS A RADIO TRANSFER THING
SO THEY DON'T MEAN THEY MEAN PHOTONS IN THE LINES ESCAPE
NOT THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT TO
I DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS
MM
UH UH
MM THAT SHOULD BE OH WAIT IS THAT S THAT'S AN OBSERVATORY ISN'T IT
THE C. T. IS THE C. T. I. O. FOUR METRE UH THE NAME OF THAT TELESCOPE
NO
AND THE A. A. T. IS AN OBSERVATORY AS WELL ISN'T IT
SO
YEAH
BUT WE IF WE PUT
YEAH
BUT THEN WE HAVE TO INCLUDE FOUR METRE AS WELL
NO
YEAH
RIGHT
YEP I AGREE
MM-HMM
WHAT IS THAT COMMA DOING THERE
YEAH NO OH I SEE I SEE I SEE YEAH
ACCOUNTING FOR GALACTIC REDDENING CONTAMINATION FROM BLENDED IRON
WHAT THEY MEAN IS BLENDED IRON LINES
YEAH
CONTINUUM FLUXES YEAH WE'RE DOING THAT YEAH
NO
UH YEAH
DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA Q. S. O.
UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS EITHER
ONE DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA Q. S. O. S
IT'S NOT A SOURCE TYPE THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE
SO
WHAT'S D. A.
AND THERE'S W. D. S
IT'S TWENTY FIVE OF D. A. TYPE AND SIX OF D. B. TYPE
YEP
YEP
YES YOU'RE FINE WITH THAT
NOPE
OKAY
YEAH
NO LUMINOS
YEAH LOW LUMINOSITY Q. S. O. S NO
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEM A LOT BUT
WELL WE'RE DOING ULTRA LUMINOUS GALAXIES
SO WE SHOULD DO
YEAH
PEOPLE DISCUSS THEM AS A SEPARATE CLASS
THEY ARE AS AS MUCH AS ULTRA LUMINOUS GALAXIES ARE
AND YEP THAT SHOULD BE IN
EXCELLENT
REGIONS
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT
OH A. AND B.
NO THAT'S THE CONJUNCTURAL
I'M RIGHT HERE I THINK
IF YEAH
YEAH THAT'S OKAY
UH
OH
RIGHT
IN THE A. A. L. OUTFLOW IT'S A R YEAH THAT DOESN'T COUNT
IT DOESN'T COUNT
AND I DIDN'T OOH
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS
OH I HIGHLIGHTED ALL AS ONE RIGHT
OKAY YEAH
THE N. SHOULD BE
YEAH YEAH
MM
HMM
YEAH
OH I SEE
SO YOUR N. STARTS YEP YEP I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
MM
SO N. PROBABLY SHOULD BE HIGHLI
YEP
ABSORPTION COMPONENTS DON'T COUNT
CONTINUUM SOURCE DOES THAT COUNT
SHOULDN'T BE
MM OH SO IT IS
THAT'S RIGHT
PROBABLY YEAH
YEP
UH LINE BROADNESS
THAT'S A WAY OF SAYING LINE WIDTH THOUGH AND WE DON'T MARK LINE WIDTH
OH
RICH IRON SPECTRUM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEP THAT'S THE RICH IRON SPECTRUM
I AGREE LET'S GET RID OF IT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT THAT'S NOT SHOULDN'T GO IN
IS THAT EVERYTHING
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH YEAH WE AREN'T GONNA MAKE IT TO OUR SECOND COOKIE BREAK
I DON'T MIND
ARE GIANT ELLIPTICALS SEPARATE THINGS
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
OKAY
LINE EMITTING GAS DOESN'T GET IN
IF YOU'RE DOING EMISSION FROM HIGH YEAH
HMM
WELL SHE
SHE WAS ALLOWED EMISSION FROM HIGH EXCITATION WHAT NOT
AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME
YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS
NO
WELL I'M NOT CERTAIN IF HIGH EXCITATION SHOULD GO IN BUT IF HIGH EXCITATION SHOULD GO IN I THINK IONIZED MEANS THE SAME THING DOESN'T IT
SO
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
YOU'VE GOT X. RAY SOURCE R. ONE SEVENTEEN
MM-HMM
NO THAT'S
THIS IS DESCRIBING THE BAND YOU DO THE OBSERVATIONS IN
YEAH THAT COUNTS
ALRIGHT
RIGHT OKAY
S
S YEAH OKAY
YEP
YEP
OOH
THOSE SHOULDN'T BE THERE SHOULD THEY
NO
OH OKAY OKAY OKAY
NE YES
I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE AGREED TO CROSS OUT BEFORE ISN'T IT
I THINK IT'S A PROCESS TOO I THINK
ESPECIALLY WHEN UH THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE Y WE'RE CHOOSING LOW RED SHIFT ABSORPTION
THAT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING YOU CAN POINT TO
MM
I'M NOT TOO FAST I DON'T THINK
MM NO I'M NOT SURE
IT'S WHETHER IT'S A PROCESS OR A A FEATURE
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE
WELL IF IT WAS IF IT WAS ABSORPTION AND DAMPED LYMAN ALPHA CLOUDS YOU'D NOT MARK ABSORPTION
I DO THINK IT'S A PROCESS I THINK
HMM
MM
WELL WE'VE BOTH MARKED IT
SO LET'S LEAVE IT THERE
MICRO QUASARS
YEAH
THAT MEANS IT'S NEW FANGLED
YEAH
YEAH BUT THEY'VE MADE UP THAT WORD
YEAH
BUT W DO THEY WHAT DEFINES A MICRO QUASAR
BUT
UH YEAH YOU Y THERE'S NOT BEEN MORE THAN ONE STUDY OF DWARF AMORPHOUS NUCLEAR STAR BURST GALAXIES
SO THAT DO WE SAY WE TAKE THAT OUT
YEP THAT'S IT IN IT
SO THAT'S OKAY YEP
OH
OOPS
YEP THAT'S FINE
MM-HMM
YEAH
WE WOULDN'T HAVE LINE RATIOS
SO YEAH THAT GOES
YEAH
NO IT MODIFIES RATIOS
MM
RIGHT
YEP THAT'S FINE
PLUS RED
YEAH
WE WEREN'T DOING BROAD BAND DETECTIONS
RIGHT
THAT'S DEFINITELY AN INSTRUMENT NAME
RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
YEP YOU'RE RIGHT
YEAH
OKAY
SO YOU CAN HAVE THAT
RIGHT
AT THE OTHER ONE WE STOPPED AFTER FOUR METRE
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THAT THERE AS WELL
YEAH
WE DID IT THIS WAY BEFORE
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
CONTINUUM RADIATION
NO
NEITHER
NARROW LINE REGION EMISSION
UH DO YOU TH I THINK THAT GOES OUT
YEAH WE DON'T
YEP
UH YEP WHITE DWARFS IS A SOURCE TYPE
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
IT IS
UH
KECK IS YEAH
UH WE DIDN'T ALLOW IRON SPECTRUM
SO WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW H. OR HELIUM TWO O. SPECTRUM EITHER
YEAH
ISO ELECTRONIC
YEAH
RADIO QUASARS ARE S TYPE
BUT RADIO QUASARS MEANS RADIO LOUD QUASARS
U. V. ACCESSORS ARE RIGHT ISN'T IT
IT'S A SPECTRAL FEATURE
WE WEREN'T DOING FLAT SPECTRUM QUASARS WERE WE
NO
WERE WE
RIGHT
RIGHT
UH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
LINE STRENGTHS
MEANS EQUIVALENT WIDTHS YEAH
UH I DID MIS GROUP
YEP
HEY
EXCELLENT
YEAH
HURRAY WE'RE DONE
EXCELLENT
YEAH
NO YOU CAN'T
OH
DO WE EACH REMAIN WIRED UP
ARE WE DONE
EXCELLENT
CHEERS
IT SHOULD BE THIS ONE HERE
DO YOU RECKON THIS STANDS FOR LAMBDA OR YEAH OKAY
I FORGOT TO KEEP TRACK OF THE OVERALL SCORE LIKE WHO WINS AND WHO LOSE
MM-HMM
WELL

AND GIVE IT AN ACRONYM
G. B. H. C. OOH
GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY
HMM
MM-HMM
WAIT FR FROM THE LINGUISTIC SIDE IF YOU IF YOU MARK STAR BURST BEFORE AND IF YOU FEEL THAT STAR BURSTS ARE LIKE OBJECTS
THEN I THINK IT SH IT SHOULD STAY IN IN THIS CASE EVEN THOUGH IT'S MODIFIED BY ACTIVITY OR IT'S IT'S M MODIFYING ACTIVITY ACTUALLY
HMM
IS IS GOO AGAIN OR IS IT REALLY Z. EQUALS TWO
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
IF IT WAS RADIO LOUD QUASAR THEN YOU WOULD MARK IT AS ONE THING
I I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO UM MARK THE WHOLE THING THEN AS ONE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL
BUT
UM SO SORRY AND THE THE A. G. N. I THINK THAT SHOULD BE ONE ENTITY RIGHT
THE THE UH W WASN'T IT THAT ACCORDING TO THE UH ACRONYM RULE THE FIRST ONE

SORRY WHAT WHAT HAPPENED NOW
SO YOU YOU F YOU FOUND THAT DWARF AMORPHOUS BLAH BLAH GALAXIES THAT THAT'S NOT A PROPER NAME
BUT YOU STILL INCLUDE THE ACRONYM
OR
OH OKAY
ALRIGHT OKAY
I SEE MM-HMM
HEY WOW
UNDER TWO HOURS
AMAZING
YEAH
I TH I THINK SO YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WE'LL GO WE'VE GOT THE MAILING LISTS OUT NOW ISN'T ISN'T IT
SO IT'S EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT NOW
YEAH
SO SO EVERYONE ON THAT LIST HAS NOW BEING REMINDED
YEAH DON'T STORE ANYTHI ANYTHING SENSITIVE ON YEAH DON'T STORE ANYTHING YOU YOU CARE ABOUT ON THE MACHINES
SO
YEAH WITH THE YEAH I MEAN I DI I DI I DID DO HARD DRI HARD DRIVE CHECK UM AND A MEMORY CHECK
AND IT SAYS THERE'S NO UH THERE'S NO PROBLEMS BUT SOMETHING CAUSED IT TO GO WRONG IN THE FIRST PLACE
SO WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW
WE'LL JUST FINGERS CROSSED AND HOPE HO YEAH HO HOPE THAT ALL THIS IS JUST A SOFTWARE THING THAT WE CAN JUST FIX LIKE THAT AND THAT'LL BE IT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S SO WHAT WE YEAH ONE ONE FOR ONE
ONE WE'LL TRY AND GET DONE TODAY YEAH GET GET WINDOWS BACK ON THERE
TRY AND GET CAMTASIA ON THERE AND GET THAT TESTED OUT
AND THEN THAT WILL BE I THINK THAT'S EVERYTHING WE NEED F BEFORE WE CAN BEFORE YOU CAN START RUNNING THE EXPERIMENTS ISN'T IT
SO
YEP
YEP
YEP YEP
UH BUT UH YEAH
NO I HAVE TO MANAGE TO GET AT THINGS WORKING ON ON MONDAY
SO THAT THAT EVERYTHING WENT DOWN LIKE ON THE TUESDAY MORNING
UM SO MY M I SHOULD GET EVERYTHING WORKING ON THE UM YEAH ON MONDAY
SO SURE THAT THE J. C. T. IS ACTUALLY WORKING COLLABORATING COLLABORATING BETWEEN THE TWO MACHINES
UM I HAD DINNER I WASN'T ACTUALLY AT DINNER BUT I D HAVE THE EYE TRACKER STUFF WORKING 'CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME RUNNING ROUN RUNNING ROUND THE LAB
UM STILL HAVE TO ONCE IT'S RE INSTALLED HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO A PROPER P YEAH OF PROPER PILOT AND YEAH
YEAH
BUT UM BUT IT LOO IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DOING ALL THE CALIBRATION AND DRIFT CORRECTION THINGS THAT S ELLEN WAS WANTING ON IT
SO SO THAT DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO ADD TO THE SOFTWARE FOR THAT PART
UM
DON'T THINK SO
MM
DON'T S DON'T SOUND DON'T SOUND FAMILIAR
YEAH
YEAH SO I'LL TRY AND TRY AND GET CAMTASIA UP AND RUNNING SO I CAN TRY IT OUT WHEN WHEN WHEN WE'VE GOT HER COMING IN
AND WE'LL JUST SORT OF DO A RUN THROUGH OF PROPER PILOT JUST TO JUST JUST SO I CAN SEE TH
YEP
YEP
UM YEAH I'LL MAKE SURE MAKE SURE THEY CAN ACTUALLY PICK UP THE F UM AUDIO SIGNAL AS WELL
UH SO BUT UH IT SHOULD BE THE YEAH THE AUDIO SIGNAL SHOULD BE COMING OUT THE SPEAKERS ONCE IT'S SET UP PROPERLY
SO THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD MAKE THAT SLIGHTLY EASIER
YEAH YEP
UH BUT YEAH SO THEY'RE FORTUNATE HAVE SPEAKERS O ON THE MONITORS INSIDE THE ROOM
SO AS LONG AS AND WHAT WE'LL HAVE DONE IS JUST GONNA SET UP SO THE UH WHATEVER THE ASTERISK SOUND IS ON WINDOWS IS WHAT GETS PLAYED
SO SO JUST CHANGE SOUND TO WHATEVER YOU LIKE JUST GO THROUGH THE WINDOWS CONTROL PANEL
YEP YEAH SO I'LL I'LL HAVE THAT RUNNING OVER THE WEEKEND
UM SO LA LAST WEEK I TRIED IT WITH A ONE KILO HERTZ SOUND
UM AND IT WAS IT C IT COULD DETECT IT BUT IT WASN'T BUT BUT IT WASN'T VERY CLEAR
DID IT WITH TEN KILO HERTZ AND IT'S JUST REALLY CLEAR WHERE YOU CAN TELL EXACTLY WHERE EXACTLY WHERE THE BEEP IS NOW
SO YEAH
SO THA IT'S JU JUST A MATTER OF UM YEAH YOU JUST BA BASICALLY JUST PLAY IT
JUST PLAY A TEN KILO HERTZ SOUND OVER THE OVER THE SPEECH AND THEN JUST UM COMPARE THE TWO SIGNALS BASICALLY
UM SO I'VE I'VE GOT A LITTLE SCRIPT FOR DOING IT
SO SO YEAH YEAH
YEP YEP NOT A PROBLEM
YEP YEAH THE THE ONE THE ONE IN JUST INSTALLED SHOULD HAVE THAT NOW
UM WE'LL DOUBLE WE'LL DOUBLE CHECK AND RE INSTALL ON SOFTWARE ON THE ON THE UM EYE TRACKING MACHINES
BUT YEAH IT SHOULD UH SHOULD BE UPDATED WITHOUT ANY
SO
YEAH SO SO SO WE'VE GOT LIKE UH A BIG CIRCLE WITH A WHITE CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT FOR AN EYE
AND WE GOT LIKE A RECTANGLE WITH TWO LIKE RECTANGLE BUTTONS ON IT FOR A MOUSE
SO
UH NO THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE AS THE AS THE ORIGINAL BLOBS BASICALLY
BUT UM SO THEY UH YEAH I THINK THE MOUSE IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER BUT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HUGELY BIGGER
SO
YEAH
AND IF IT EVER EVER GETS TO BE A PROBLEM IN THE PILOT I CAN EASILY REDUCE THE SIZE OF WHATEVER
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT TOO HARD
SO
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
UH I'LL TRY IT
YEAH YEAH
SO SO YOU CAN YOU CAN DO IT IN X. FIG EXPORT THEM AS S. V. G. AND YOU JUST GET A YOU JUST GET A LIST OF X. Y. COORDINATES
UM AND THEN I'LL JUST WRITE IN A LITTLE SCRIPT THAT TURNS THOSE X. Y. COORDINATES INTO A PART
WELL THE THING IS IT'S S. V. G.
SO SO LONG AS I'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT WILL OUTPUT S. V. G.
YEAH YEAH
SO I'LL ALS I'LL ALSO HAVE A LOOK HAVE A LOOK AT THAT
BUT THE THERE'S THERE MUST BE PLENTY OF WINDOWS THINGS FOR TH THAT I O OUTPUT S. V. G.
MIN UH I KNO I KNOW I KNOW
UM I KN I KNOW ADOBE AND THINGS HAVE FACULTIES THAT DO IT
BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE LIKE A FEW HUNDRED POUNDS
UM SO OTH BUT OTHER I I'D B I'D BE VERY SURPRISED IF THERE WASN'T A FREE PACKAGE FOR DOING IT
UM I HA I HAVE A FEELING THAT THE UM AMAYA THE W. THREE C. BROWSER DOES IT
HAVE A FEELING THAT THAT CAN ACTUALLY EDIT S. V. G. FILES
YEP YEP
YEP FAIR ENOUGH
YEAH
UM WHEN WILL YEAH BUT NO I'LL I'LL CREATE A C I'LL CREATE A CONVEX PART UM JUST SO NEXT WEEK UM JU YEAH
BUT IT JUST IT IT JUST JUST HAPPENED TO BE A CONVEX PART THAT I WAS THAT I WAS I WAS PLAYING WITH
SO IT IT HANDLED THAT FINE
UM IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY SELF INTERSECTIONS SO THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM
SO I'LL JUST HAVE TO HAVE CHECK THAT
BUT
YEAH BY BY A BY A PART OF IT CROSSES OVER ITSELF
UM S SO IT'S SORTA LIKE A B
YEAH THAT SORT OF THING
YEAH
SO
YEAH
IF IF IT IF IT BECOMES A YEAH
YEP
YEAH SO FOR NOW WE'LL JUST JUST ASSUME THAT NON INTERSE NON INTERSECTING UM AND UM YEAH
AND THEN THERE'S THIS AT THE MOMENT THE E THE S. V. G. STUFF CAN OUTPUT ONES WHICH AREN'T CLOSED POLYGONS
BUT UM ONES ONES YOU ONES THAT ACTUALLY HAD TURN UP INTO PARTS LIST UH IT CREATES A CLOSED POLYGON BY LINKING THE L END POINT TO THE START POINT
SO SO UH YEAH SO AS LONG AS LONG AS THEY'RE YEAH
SO SO SO AS LONG AS THEY'RE THEY'RE DRAWN WELL ENOUGH IT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT
SO UM BUT YEAH
SUPPOSE LET NIJMEGEN UH FIND THEIR FIND THEIR OWN S. V. G. SORT OF FIND SOMETHING THAT DOES S. V. G. AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT MI IT MIGHT BE WORTH JUST CHECKING WHAT SOFTWARE THEY ARE USING 'CAUSE IT MIGHT CREA IT MIGHT CREATE OUTPUTS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM X. FIG
SO
YEAH
THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE FUN
YEAH I THINK IT DOES S. V. J. UH S. V. J. OUTPUT
UM SO I'LL I CA I CAN EASY DOUBLE CHECK IF UH NIJMEGEN CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT OTHER THAN THAT THAT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO INSTALL THOUGH WASN'T IT
IT WAS YEAH
COPY AND PASTE THE STUFF OUT THE OFF OFF THE WIKI
SO
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN UH ALSO DOUBLE CHECKED IN THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA W COULD ACCESS THE C. V. S. FROM HOME WHEN I WAS WORKING FROM HOME LAST LAST WEEK
UM ON THURSDAY I MANAGED TO MANAGED TO GET IN AND JUST JUST CHECK THE STUFF AND MAKE SURE IT WAS ALL MAKE SURE TH MAKE SURE MA MAKE SURE I COULD ACCESS IT
SO THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE ACCESSING IT ONCE THEY'VE GOT THE LOG INS
SO NOT YET I'M AFRAID
UH WELL ON ONCE UH ONCE I'VE TRIED OUT THE CAMTASIA STUFF I'LL SEE IF THE IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS GONNA TR GONNA TRY AND FIX THEM
IF THERE ISN'T ANY PROBLEMS
NEXT TIME I'M WORKING ON THIS UH G. D. F. STUFF UM SO SO I'VE I'VE I PU UH PUT ON A D. T. D. AND A SAMPLE X. M. L. FILE ON THE WIKI FOR THE G. D. F.
SO IT'S BA BASED ON SOME STUFF YOU PUT ON THERE ON THE G. D. F. SPECIFICATION
UM
YEAH I MEAN WITH I CHA I CHANGED A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM YOUR ORIGINAL DRAFT
UM SO THERE'S NOT UH THERE'S NO LONGER A SEPARATE THING FOR CREATING NEW PARTS
SO JUST PUT A START AND END TIME ON EACH PART
UH SO
SO THE THE YOU YOU YOU HAD A YOU HAD A THING CALL I THINK IT'S MOULD OR SO OR SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID WHICH IS SORT OF TO CREATE A NEW PART
THERE'S AN ACTION TO CREATE A NEW PART
UM BUT I TH UH I'VE I GAVE EACH PART A START TIME AND AN END TIME UM SO YOU CAN SEE WHEN THE PARTS WERE CREATED
SO I'M NOT SU SO I'M NOT NOT SURE IF YOU WANNA KEEP THE MOULD OR NOT
UH
YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S JUST THE G. D. F. SPECIFICATION PAGE ON THE UH ON THE WIKI
I'VE UH I MEAN I'LL TRY TRY TO PUT IN JUSTIFICATION FOR FOR THE CHANGE THAT I MADE UH ON THE PAGE
SO UM BUT I'VE I'VE SENT IT OUT FOR REVIEW SO THAT S ANYONE WHO IS GONNA USING THE FORMAT CAN HAVE A LOOK AT IT
HUH
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MIND WHEN THE
YEAH
WELL THE ONES THAT THIS STUFF I MEAN IS IT'S HELPFUL
IT WAS HELPFUL FOR ME TO PUTTING IT UP ON THE WIKI 'CAUSE I COULD ACTUALLY THIN THINK ABOUT IT AS I PUT IT UP AND SAY WELL THIS IS THIS IS WHY AND TH THIS IS WHY I WANNA DO THINGS THIS WAY
UM SO
YEP YEP
YEP
FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
WELL UH WELL I KN I KNOW ON CAMTASIA IF YOU GOT A CA IF YOU'VE GOT A CAMTASIA PROJECT
YOU CAN HAVE THE VIDEO AND AUDIO STORED SEPARATELY
IN WHICH CASE
YEAH
SO YEAH
SO SO WE JUST ENDED THE JUST ENDED THE THE DUTCH STREAM YEAH THE VIDEO AND OUR AUDIO
AND THEN THEY CAN EASY CREATE THEIR AUDIO OUT OF MM FROM THAT OUTP
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL ONE THING UH ONE ONE THING THAT CAMTASIA CAN DO YOU CAN HAVE LITTLE VIDEOS WHEN OTHER HAVEN'T GOTTEN GOT ANY CAMERAS FOR DOING THAT
BUT YOU COULD LIKE HAVE VIDEOS OF PEOPLE CLICK ON THE MOUSES AND SORTA OR WHATEVER ELSE MM-HMM
YOU CAN DO YEAH YOU CAN GENERATE CALL OUTS AND WHATEVER
SO THE MIGHT YEAH I'M SURE THERE MUST BE A WAY OF PUTTING BIG ARROWS OV OR WHATEVER
UM
OOPS
NO I'M AN AF AFRAID NOT
I WOULDN'T KNOW
NO
NO NO
THAT'S A S THAT'S PSYCHOLOGY THING HOW HARD THEY
YEAH YEAH SO THIS YEAH
YES YES
HE'LL HE'LL JUST BE WORKING WITH ROBIN ON WHAT ANALYSIS WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE G. D. F. FORMAT
UM SO I'M GONNA C BASICALLY I'VE GOT A THE GEST ANALYSER'S THE BASE THE BASIS FOR UH UM ASCII TO G. D. F. CONVERTER
UM SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS ACTUALLY CREATE AN OUTPUT UH A G. D. F. OUTPUT PART TO IT
UM 'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT UH ONLY OUTPUTS THE VIDEO
UM BUT IT DOES HAVE INTERNAL STRUCTURES WILL JUST MAKE IT EASY TO DO THE THE X. M. L.
SO SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA LOOK AT
AND THEN ONCE I'VE DONE THAT I CAN LOOK AT THE WHATEVER ANALYSIS WE NEED TO GET DONE OUT OF THE G. D. F.
YEP
YEAH YEAH
YEP
YEAH
UM I THINK THAT'S IT
AND I'LL T UH YEAH
I'LL GET GET WORKING ON THE CAMTASIA STUFF THIS WEEK AND THEN SO ONCE UH ONCE UH ONCE WE'VE GOT SOME SOME IDEA ABOUT WHAT ANALYSIS YOU WANT OUT OF THIS
I CAN THINK ABOUT WHETHER G. D. F. 'S GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED IN IT
UM AND F YEAH WHAT ANALYSIS WE CAN PULL OUT OF IT
YEAH YEAH
SO I'LL I'LL DOUBLE CHECK THE G. D. F. SPECIFICATION AGAINST THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU SAID THAT YOU'D YOU SAY YOU NEED FROM THAT LIST
UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
'CAUSE THEY I MEAN WE W WE GOT ALL THIS IN THE ASCII FORMAT AT THE MOMENT AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHAT DATA DO WE NEED TO PULL OUT OF THAT INTO THE G. D. F. SO I CAN ACTUALLY DO THE PROPER ANALYSIS
UM 'CAUSE I THINK ALL THE ANSWERS ARE GONNA BE RUN OFF THE G. D. F. FORMAT 'CAUSE 'CAUSE WE'VE DECIDED THAT IF WE WENT AND LOOKED WELL IF WE'RE LOOKING AT DYNAMIC REASONS AND WHATEVER ELSE
IT HAS TO BE G. D. F.
YEAH
WHICH IS YEAH WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO DO IT OFF THE G. D. F. AS AS OPPOSED TO THE E. D. F. FORMAT
SO
YEAH YEAH
SO SO THE G. D. F. IT'S GOT YEAH SO IT'S IT'S GOT UH THE ALL TH THE STUFF ON THE UM E. D. F.
SO IT'S JUST THE UH THE ASCII FILE THE THINGS LIKE THE MOUSE MOVEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
AND THEN YEAH YEAH AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT G. D. F. CAN ALSO IT WILL ALSO HAVE INFORMATION SUCH AS RIGHT
AT THIS POINT IN TIME THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE NEW PARTS AREA OR THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE TARGET
YEAH
UM SO YEAH
SO THE THE G. D. F. IS GONNA HAVE THAT SORT OF INFORMATION IN IT
AND THEN ALSO 'CAUSE IT'S X. M. L. FILE WE CAN THEN DO X. S. L. T. OR WHATEVER ON TO IT TO GET EXTRACT WHATEVER BITS OF DATA YOU NEED FOR YEAH
FOR FOR WHICHEVER BITS OF ANALYSIS YOU'RE TRYING TO DO FROM IT
SO
YEP
OKAY
YEAH
I MEAN M MY VIEW ON THIS WAS THAT UM THE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO BACK UP THEIR DATA PERSONALLY WAS MADE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TO LAB USERS
UM I MEAN I GUESS RIGHT OKAY
AS LONG AS SHE ADMITS IT THEN THEN THAT'S FINE
I I'M JUST THINKING YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN THERE'S A A PROCESS ERROR LIKE THAT YOU THINK OH THEN THERE'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD CHANGE
LIKE MAKE THE SIGN IN BIGGER RED LETTERS
BUT I IN THE OUR CASE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING MORE WE CAN DO REALLY
SO UM WELL I DOUBT ANYBODY'LL DO THAT AGAIN 'CAUSE THAT'LL GET AROUND
SO
YEAH THERE WAS A MAILING LIST BEFORE
THEY'VE JUST REVIVED THAT RIGHT
RIGHT OKAY
UH-HUH
RIGHT
AND WE DON'T KNOW SO THERE'S EVERY CHANCE OF THIS FALLING OVER AGAIN IF IT'S A HARDWARE THING RIGHT
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT APART FROM
RIGHT
YEAH
WHY IS UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
SO HOW LONG DOES THIS PUT YOU BACK FOR
IS IT YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH DISRUPTION DOES THIS CAUSE
D IS THIS A DAY
TWO DAYS
DAY AND A BIT
YEAH
UH-HUH
TO ACTUALLY DO THE RE INSTALL
YOU C
MM-HMM
AND I SAW UH A BUNCH OF STUFF ABOUT SOFTWARE UPDATES
THAT'S UN UNRELATED TO THIS PROBLEM RIGHT
UM THE EYE LINK
I C I DIDN'T READ 'EM
I SAW LIKE FIVE MESSAGES GO BACK AND FORTH
MAYBE THEY WERE UNDER THE WRONG SUBJECT HEADER
SO ANYWAY WE HAVE WELL
OH NO I MEAN THE EYE LINK SOFTWARE
SO IT'S UNRELATED IT'S NOT THAT RIGHT
OKAY GOOD
UM
YEAH
SO UH I UH DID HE GET HIS DATA IN
OR IS THIS PUT HIS SCHEDULE BACK
HE'S DONE IT OKAY
RIGHT
UM WELL UNFORTUNATE BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE UM YOU GUYS ARE WELL PLACED FOR DEALING WITH IT
SO BETTER YOU THAN ME
YEAH
OH SO YOU NEED TO BORROW SOMEBODY'S HEAD AND MOUTH AND STUFF TO TO RUN IT RIGHT
AND
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO I'VE GOT A NEW UM TRAINEE WHO MIGHT NEED AMUSEMENT AT SOME POINT
SO IF YOU NEED TO BORROW A HEAD THAT TALKS THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO DO MUCH ELSE
I'LL TH I'LL ASK HER IF SHE'D MIND COMING DOWN AND HELPING YOU OUT FOR UH A WHILE
BUT I GUESS ELLEN WAS GONNA BE YOUR THE P THE PERSON WHO YEAH YOUR SPARE HEAD
RIGHT
YEAH
SO UM UH MINE IS WELL SHE'S ACTUALLY CLIMBING BEN NEVIS TODAY I THINK
BUT UH SHE'LL BE UH BACK TOMORROW
HER NAME'S NYNKE
DID YOU GUYS MEET HER
THIS SEEMS THE SORT OF THING THAT PEOPLE MIGHT MIGHT FIND I FIND AMUSING TO LOOK AT
SO UM I I'LL I'LL SEE IF IF SHE'D BE WILLING TO
OH WHO IS THAT
OH YEAH HEIDI
OH YEAH SHE'S GOOD
YOU GUYS MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON 'CAUSE SHE DOES WELL YOU KNOW STUFF FOR THE VIDEO CODING AND GESTURING
AND AUTISM
BUT
SO OKAY
UH RIGHT WHAT AM I WRITING
UH OKAY NYNKE TO VOLUNTEER
WELL UH NO UH I WILL ACTUALLY GIVE HER THE THE OPTION
BUT UM IT SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU KNOW
I THINK IT'S QUITE USEFUL WHEN YOU'RE AT THAT STAGE TO SEE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES PEOPLE USE
SO
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OOPS
WELL YOU FOUND THAT THEN
RIGHT
OKAY
SO WE WANT ONE YOU CAN PICK UP USING MATLAB OR SOMETHING RIGHT
AYE
OKAY
PERFECT
PERFECT
SO OR YOU'RE GONNA BANK THE SCRIPT SOME PLACE AND TELL US HOW TO RUN IT
UH-HUH
'CAUSE WE WON'T KNOW
RIGHT
WELL THAT ALL SOUNDS GOOD
OH REALLY
OH OKAY
UH-HUH OKAY
VERY NICE VERY PRETTY
IT DOESN'T GET IN THE WAY OF SEEING WHAT'S UNDERNEATH
VERSION ONE
MM-HMM
IT'S NOT TOO BAD
UH-HUH
I C I CAN I CAN SEE WHERE THAT'S USEFUL
NO
JUST CHANGE IT
MM-HMM
YEAH
ALTHOUGH IF IF YOU HAD A BIG THING AND IT WAS JIGGLING AROUND LIKE ANYBODY'S BUSINESS
LIKE REAL EYE TRACK TRACES THEN YOU MIGHT FIND THAT A LITTLE BIT DISCONCERTING
I MEAN SMALL THINGS YOU KIND OF EXPECT TO JIGGLE AROUND RIGHT
BUT
IT'LL LOOK LIKE IT'S QUIVERING YOU KNOW
YEAH BUT WELL THAT'S ALL FINE
WHAT ELSE
YOU WERE SAYING JOE WITH THE MODEL BUILDER
OH REMIND ME
OH YES
OKAY
OH THAT'S GOOD
OH OKAY
REALLY
JUST THE PARALLELOGRAM
RIGHT
OKAY SO YOU YOUR JOB IN THIS IS TO UM ENSURE THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A BUG AND THEN PASS IT TO JOE
OKAY
THAT MAKES SENSE
I MEAN THE THIS GEOMETRY STUFF IS REALLY TRICKY IF YOU DON'T DO THE FOLD THE BOXES STUFF IN YOUR HEAD WELL SO I CAN IMAGINE
'CAUSE I COULD GET IT BACKWARDS EASILY YOU KNOW AND SO IT IS JUST AS WELL FOR W FOR YOU TO CHECK THIS
UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH SO YOU NEED TO DRAW 'EM IN SOMETHING
OH SO YEAH I SUGGESTED YOU DO THAT IN X. FIG
IS THAT A REASONABLE THING TO DO OR NO
YEP MM-HMM
YEAH
SO THIS IS THIS FALLS DOWN COMPLETELY IF NIJMEGEN CAN'T RUN X. FIG
SO YOU BETTER CHECK THAT WITH 'EM RIGHT
BUT
OKAY BUT THEY MAY NEED HELP FINDING THE SOMETHING IF THEY CAN'T DO X. FIG I SUPPOSE
MICROSOFT THOUGH
I MEAN WELL WHAT KINDS OF
THEY ARE THE PAID
YEAH AND
UH-HUH
YEP MM-HMM
OKAY
SO I WOULDN'T DO ANY ANY WORK TO FIND OUT WHAT'LL OUTPUT S. V. G.
JUST ASK THEM LOOK YOU KNOW SAY WE YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT DOES S. V. G. AND THEN UM IF THEY IF THEY COME BACK AND SAY HA
THEN Y YOU MAY NEED TO POODLE AROUND A BIT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
BUT UH YOU KNOW LET THEM LET THEM SAY THEY'VE GOT A PROBLEM BEFORE YOU UM SPEND TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'LL DO IT
'CAUSE
UH-HUH
YEAH YEAH
OH SO WELL I CAN IMAGINE THERE BEING UH SHAPES THAT YOU COULD CONSTRUCT IN S. V. G. FORMAT THAT WOULD FOX THE MODEL BUILDER IN SOME WAY
I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE SPECS ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF SHAPES ARE ALLOWED RIGHT
UM RIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY'RE UM CONVEX OR CONCAVE IN FUNNY WAYS
YEAH EX
AND YOU TRIED IT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
WOULD WE WANT BY SELF INTERSECTION YOU MEAN YOU COULD
YOU MEAN LIKE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
WELL BUT BY SELF INTERSECTION HERE I'LL DRAW HERE IF I CAN FIND THE RIGHT END OF THE PEN
Y DO YOU MEAN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
A AND YOU CAN RULE OUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT
'CAUSE THAT'S TWO PARTS FOR YOU
YEAH
UM I MEAN YOU KNOW SOME F RAINY DAY YOU MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT
WELL I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN IT YOU KNOW LATER ON WE CAN FIX IT IF IT IF IT TURNS OUT THOSE PARTS IT'S NOT URGENT NOW
I THINK THIS ISN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH
YEAH
YEP MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
YEAH
BUT BUT BUT IF THEY HAVE TROUBLE YOU KNOW HALF AN HOUR GOOGLING AND HELPING HELPING THEM IS PROBABLY WORTHWHILE
'CAUSE SOMETI SOMETIMES PEOPLE I MEAN IT ACTUALLY I WOULD E I WOULDN'T EXPECT THEM TO HAVE ANY TROUBLE FINDING SOMETHING 'CAUSE J. P. IS QUITE UP WITH ALL THE ALL THESE THINGS
SO UM ARE TH
WELL YOU LET'S UM ENCOURAGE THEM NOT TO USE UM ANY SOFTWARE THAT MIGHT HAVE IDIOSYNCRATIC IDEAS ABOUT WHAT S. V. G. IS
SHE SAYS DELICATELY
I HAVE NO OOH THAT I WASN'T GONNA SAY
I I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THEY HAVE IDIOSYNCRATIC S. V. G. OUTPUT OR WHETHER BUT UM THEIR TRACK THEIR TRACK RECORD COULD UH ON SOME OF THE OTHER STANDARDS HAS NOT THERE HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY STRANGE THINGS ABOUT IT
SO UM BUT IN MY UH YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY SH THAT SHOULD BE IF
MM-HMM
UM YEAH
I HAVEN'T LOOKED THROUGH OTHER MAIL
I DID SEE SOMETHING FROM MARLOES
IS THERE ANYTHING THEY'RE WAITING ON FROM US THAT IS A PROBLEM OR I THEY REASONABLY HAPPY AT THE MOMENT
OH THEY'VE DONE THE PILOTS
OH GOOD
DUMPED THE DATA
WHERE IS IT DUMPED
B. S. C. W.
WELL THAT'S OKAY
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT USING THAT MUCH SPACE IF IT'S JUST FOR INTERIM
AND THEY HAVE TO GET OUT TO US SOME WAY
UM UH WE HAD A UH BRIEF DISCUSSION JUST BEFORE I LEFT ABOUT UH THIS IDEA OF EXCHANGING DATA BY FIRE WIRE DRIVE AND I DO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT EVER GOT RESOLVED
BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR LITTLE THINGS LIKE THIS
SO I THINK B. S. C. W. IS THE RIGHT WAY TO EXCHANGE THESE
WE JUST HAVE TO WIPE THIS STUFF OFF AND KEEP SEPARATE COPIES AFTER THAT
THE C. V. S.
OH SO YOU'RE MANAGING THAT OKAY AND YOU HAVEN'T RUN INTO C. V. S. BEFORE
OKAY
WELL GOOD
YEAH YEAH YEAH
WELL THAT'S THAT'S REASSURING
COURSE HE'S SITTING ON THE NEXT DESK
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL SHE'LL HAVE TO U USE THE C. V. S. EVENTUALLY 'CAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD WAY OF DOING THIS OTHERWISE
BUT
MM-HMM
WELL THAT'S IT WE'LL NEVER SEE HIM HERE AGAIN
WATCH I'LL FIND OUT HE'S GOT A BETTER COMPUTER AT HOME AS WELL RIGHT
RIGHT AND WHAT ABOUT UM THE PROJECT AS A WHOLE
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT RUUD OR ANYBODY IS AFTER THAT WE AREN'T SUPPLYING
NOT AT THE MOMENT RIGHT
THEY'RE THEY'RE CRITICAL THE TO THE SUCCESS OF A PROJECT
SO
Y UH YEAH AND GENERAL PLACES
BUT YEAH I WOULDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT UNLESS THEY ASK YOU FOR SPECIFIC INPUT
YEAH
THAT'S WHAT'S CIRCULATING
UH-HUH
OH YEAH
MM-HMM
AND JOHN'S GOING
MM-HMM
OH THAT'S GOOD
HE'LL BE USEFUL FOR THE W. P. SEVEN STUFF
SO
WELL WHILE YOU DO THAT I'LL BE TRAINED IN HOW TO HIRE PEOPLE
SO
UH BOTH
SO
SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ON FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK BESIDES GETTING THIS STUFF UP AND RUNNING AGAIN
YEAH
RIGHT
SO ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT IT THAT I SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT OR YOU HAPPY WITH IT
I MEAN I SORT OF WROTE THE INITIAL DRAFT OF IT I SUPPOSE
SO
UM UH SLOWER
UH-HUH
OKAY
UM I'LL HAVE TO LOOK
I CAN'T REMEMBER UM HOW THIS WORKS NOW 'CAUSE IT WAS A WHILE AGO
SO
YEAH AND YOU'LL GET NOTHING BACK UNLESS I LOOK AT IT RIGHT
SO I BEST FOR FOR US FOR ME TO DO THAT
I I UM YEAH I I MEAN IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT YOU'RE Y UM PUTTING THINGS OUT FOR FOR REVIEW AND SAYING LIKE WHY FOR STUFF
BUT UM WE DON'T WE ALSO DON'T WANT UM TO BURN TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME RECORDING STUFF THAT THAT NOBODY'S EVER GONNA LOOK AT NECESSARILY
SO I MEAN THIS THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD CASE FOR OR IT MIGHT UH OR IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU SHOULD JUST LIKE YOU KNOW
TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS STUFF IF I HAPPEN TO BE AROUND AT THE TIME THAT YOU'RE DOING IT AND NOT Y SO I IF THE WRITING STUFF DOWN ON THE WIKI GETS TO BE TOO HIGH A PROPORTION OF THINGS
THEN THEN YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANNA DO IT
YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
THE SO UM I TH I THINK IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE RECORDS AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
ESPECIALLY IN IN BIG DISPERSED GROUPS BUT THIS IS KIND OF A SMALLER GROUP
UM SO IT YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THINGS MORE INFORMALLY WHERE F YOU FEEL THE WIKIS ARE GETTING IN THE WAY OF THINGS
SO
OH YEAH IT WELL IF IT AIDS YOU IN THINKING TO WRITE IT DOWN THEN DEFINITELY WRITE IT DOWN
'CAUSE YEAH WE WANT CLEAR THINKING
UM I CAN'T ACTUALLY REMEMBER UH I HOW IT WORKED WITH THE THE MOULDS
I MEAN I W I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT UM
NO I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
SO I'LL I'LL LOOK AT IT
UH BUT UH I'M SURE IT'S FINE 'CAUSE UM IT'S JUST MY MEMORY OF THINGS
OH YEAH UH-HUH
YEAH
SO UM IS THAT GONNA HAVE A VOICE OVER OR IS IT WE HAD DISCUSSIONS BEFORE YOU STARTED ABOUT WHETHER IT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY SILENT SO THAT THEY COULD USE IN CASE WE EVER WANTED TO DO THIS IN IN DUTCH
YEAH
AND UH AND SO YOU KNOW
YOU COULD JUST HAVE SORT OF WELL THE I THINK WE DISCUSSED HAVING IT WITH AN ENGLISH VOICE OVER OR HAVING IT WITH NO VOICE OVER AND THEN HAVING IT W JUST WITH CARTOON NOISES OR SOMETHING LIKE OR YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS BREAK
SO TO EMPHASISE THE I MAY BE IMAGINING IT
OH SO WE COULD PRODUCE A DUTCH VOICE OVER FOR THE SAME THING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY THE OTH THE OTHER ISSUE IS UM UH I IF WE DO A VOICE OVER UH DOES THAT AFFECT THE LANGUAGE THAT THE PEOPLE CHOOSE TO USE
S SO THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER REASON FOR NOT DOING THAT
ALIGNMENT OR YOU KNOW
YEAH
SO I THINK MAYBE THAT WAS ANOTHER REASON FOR UM JUST HAVING
OR OR OR DING FOR YOU KNOW YOU GOT IT OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YEAH YEAH YEAH
WELL THAT Y
YEAH
WELL YOU NEED SOME WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY NOTICE THE THING YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THEM IF THERE'S NO VOICE UH
OR OR YOU COULD JUST POINT TO YOU KNOW HAVE B GREAT BIG ARROW THAT POINTS AT THE TWO PIECES THAT BROKE
YOU KNOW AND
YEAH
SO YOU GONNA CLEAR OR R HOWEVER YOU DO THIS WITH ELLEN RIGHT
'CAUSE SHE'S THE ONE THAT HAS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE AND STUFF
OH WELL REMIN REMIND HER THAT THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THERE OUGHTA BE ONE
MM-HMM
I BET MARLOES JUST TALKED TO 'EM
AH I THINK IT'S REALLY UP TO US TO
IS IT HARD
YOU DON'T WANNA GIVE 'EM THE SPECIFICATION YOU KNOW 'CAUSE THAT'S IN TOO HIGH FALUTIN A LANGUAGE
BUT UM OH I IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD TO GENERATE SOMETHING THAT SAYS
MM-HMM
OH UM UH ON MY HOLIDAYS WE ENCOUNTERED A CHILDREN'S TOYSHOP WHERE THERE WE THERE WERE TAMGRAMS
AND MY SON REMINDED ME THAT HE CA HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND HIS TAMGRAM SET IN A WHILE
WELL UH IF NOT IF YOU GUYS ARE USING IT
OR DO Y DO YOU FIND IT HELPFUL TO HAVE IT
OH BUT IT'S SO TACTILE TO HAVE THE LITTLE METAL BITS
IF YOU IF YOU'RE USING IT KEEP IT
HE'S GOT PLENTY OF TOYS
IF YOU'RE NOT IF YOU'RE NOT USING IT THEN I'LL TAKE IT BACK
YEAH Y IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A WORRY
THE THE LAD HAS PLENTY OF TOYS
OH SIMILAR TYPES UH-HUH
YEAH
RIGHT
SO UM HOW YOU GONNA GET YOUR COMPLEXITY RATINGS
GOOGLE
IS THERE A BIG TAMGRAM COMMUNITY THAT RANKS THESE THINGS
LIKE YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST ONE BOOKLET THAT CAME WITH ONE SET OF TAMGRAMS
OR OR IS IT OBVIOUS LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE THINGS
YEAH
BUT THAT STILL WON'T TELL YOU WELL HOW MANY TAMGRAMS ARE THERE THAT THEY'RE USING
FIFTEEN OR SOMETHING
NO NOT EVEN
UH-HUH
SO THAT'S NOT GONNA G SO THAT'S NOT GONNA TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT RELATIVE COMPLEXITY
THAT'S JUST GONNA TELL YOU WHERE IN THE SPAN YOU WANNA BE
YOU STILL NEED SOME KINDA SCALE FOR THESE THINGS
CA UH IF YOU LOOK AT 'EM DO YOU JUST KNOW
NO
I WOULD EITHER
WHAT ABOUT HIM
I IF H MISTER GEOMETRY
I MEAN YOU KNOW
CAN YOU TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT THESE HOW HARD PEOPLE FIND THEM
OR RIGHT OKAY
WELL
WHO IS PSYCHOLOGY ALREADY USES TAMGRAMS THAT'S STILL AROUND
MEAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING TAMGRAMS FOR AGES
SO THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY WITH A FOLK WISDOM YOU CAN CONTACT
RIGHT
I ONLY KNOW ANCIENT PAPERS
SO LIKE LATE EIGHTIES
DO PEOPLE STILL USE TAMGRAMS
OH
SO WE'RE VERY OLD FASHIONED
WELL THERE WAS STUFF IN THE SEVENTIES AND THE EIGHTIES RIGHT
SO SINCE THEN
RIGHT
WELL THE OLD THE OLD TASKS ARE THE BEST
SO I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT WORRY ME
UM
SO UH SORRY THAT WAS K I THINK A BIG DIVERSION
AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE GONNA DO NEXT AFTER ALL THIS STUFF WAS UP AND THE I WAS GONNA LOOK AT THE G. D. F. SPEC
ARE THE REST OF THE Y UH ARE IS THE REST OF WHAT YOU'RE TO DO WITH THAT SOFTWARE FAIRLY CLEAR
'CAUSE THIS IS ABOUT THE ANALYSIS
YOU REALLY ONLY NEED ROBIN RIGHT TO TO SPECIFY THE REST
UH-HUH
YEP MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH 'CAUSE THERE WERE ALL THESE ISSUES ABOUT HOW YOU CALCULATE EYE EYE LAG AND YOU KNOW
W WHAT OTHER TH ANALYSES WE WANT O WANT OUT OF THIS THAT AREN'T SETTLED
BUT I THINK UM YOU KNOW ROBIN IS THE PERSON WHO KNOWS THE MOST ABOUT WHAT'S REQUIRED THERE
AND I CAN IMAGINE IT'S GONNA TAKE A WEE WHILE TO I CAN IMAGINE YOU KNOW
SO THAT MIGHT BE THE FOCUS OF DISCUSSIONS NEXT WEEK OR SOMETHING RIGHT THAT UM WHAT NEED OUT OF THIS AND
YEAH SO YOU MIGHT WANNA TRY AND COME
IF YOU GET THAT FAR
TRY AND COME EQUIPPED WITH A LIST OF THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU WANT OUT OF IT AND AND SO WE CAN LOOK THROUGH AND SEE
UM UH Y ELLEN MIGHT HAVE VIEWS ON WHAT KINDS OF THINGS ONCE WE HAVE A LIST RIGHT
SO SO YEAH
SO BUT IT'D BE GOOD TO YOU KNOW
MAKE SURE ONCE WE HAVE A LIST OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK WE'RE GETTING OF IT THAT IT MATCHES HER INTENTIONS FOR WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET OUT OF IT
SO UM YOU KNOW IF WE DO TALK ABOUT THAT THEN IT MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE HER ALONG FOR IT
OH YEAH
OH YEAH
WHO IS THAT THEN
'KAY
UM ARE THEY STILL IN THE BUSINESS
WHERE ARE THEY
OKAY
WELL THEY MIGHT HAVE THE FOLK WISDOM ON THE COMPLEXITY RIGHT
SO NINETY TWO'S NOT THAT LONG AGO
WELL IT IS REALLY
BUT
UM IS IT A PAPER YOU CAN GET
WELL THEY STILL DO IT FOR LIBRARY LOANS AND STUFF SO
UH-HUH YEP
SO DO WE THINK NEXT WEEK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT
'CAUSE WE WANT WANNA ASK ELLEN AHEAD OF TIME IF SHE WANTS TO COME ALONG FOR A DISCUSSION ABOUT OH WELL THAT'S THAT'S FINE THEN
OKAY
OH YEAH C SHE 'CAUSE SHE HER STUFF IS GETTING BLOCKED OFF THE MAILING LIST 'CAUSE SHE'S NOT MAILING FROM HER NORMAL ACCOUNT
YEAH
AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT ANY WAY TO JUST APPROVE MESSAGES FROM HER WITHOUT HER SUBSCRIBING AT THAT ACCOUNT
SO
UM
THERE'S ONLY ONE MESSAGE SO FAR
IT DIDN'T SAY MUCH
UH
YEP
ANYTHING ELSE
YEAH
BU I DON'T THINK THAT LIST IS OUR FINAL WORD ON THINGS AND
OH WELL MAYBE IT IS THEN
I
UH-HUH
I DON'T THINK I WAS FULLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT
I MEAN I'M NOT GONNA HAVE VIEWS ON THIS ANYWAY
WHAT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IS MAKING SURE THAT UM THERE'S NOT BIG SURPRISES FOR ELLEN AND AND J. P. YOU KNOW
WHEN THEY SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE ASSUMING SOME ANALYSIS IS IN THERE AND WE DIDN'T DIDN'T PUT IT IN
YOU KNOW
'CAUSE NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO BE FIGURING OUT WHAT WE WANT OUT OF THAT DATA AND AND GETTING YOU WRITE THE STUFF OR GETTING J. P. TO WRITE THE ONE DIMENSIONAL ANALYSES THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
SO
OH RIGHT
OKAY
SO Y ACTUALLY YOU'RE BREAKING THIS DOWN INTO TWO STEPS NOW
ONE IS JUST A STRAIGHT EXTRACTION FROM THE ASCII AND THE OTHER ONE IS ANY POST ANALYSIS THAT THAT ADDS INFORMATION BY ANALYSING IT
IS THAT TH
YEAH IT'S JUST ANYTHING THAT'S GOT SHOVED THROUGH THE EYE TRACKER
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY THAT IS POST ANALYSIS
YEAH
SO RIGHT YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
OH WELL THAT ALL SOUNDS GOOD
SO
I'VE GOT O UH ONE THING TO CHECK AND ONE PERSON TO ASK IF SHE'LL VOLUNTEER TO BE A HEAD
AND AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT'S IT FOR ME
SEE I HAVE TO EXPLAIN
I'M FOR FOR ONE OF MY OTHER THINGS I THERE IS NOW A SPECIFIC WIKI PAGE THAT SAYS STUFF JEAN HAS TO DO
AND I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT THIS IS QUITE A GOOD IDEA 'CAUSE I WORRY ABOUT NOT DOING THE STUFF PEOPLE EXPECT OF ME
MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND RIGHT
WHAT DOCUMENTATION
OH OKAY
WELL IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE ITS WAY INTO ITS MY SALARY I'M AFRAID
SO
BUT YEAH
I MEAN I DO SPEND TIME TALKING TO YOU GUYS
SO YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF ME
UH YEAH
SO WE'VE MOVED OVER AND ONTO THE OTHER EYE LINK
SO UH 'CAUSE SHE'S RUNNING AT THE MOMENT
SHE DID ADMIT IT
YES
UH-HUH
HMM
NO
BUT MA
YES
SHOCK AND WORRY AT UH I THINK YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A MAILING LIST UH AND MM-HMM YEAH
UH F FRANK WENT THROUGH IT DELETED THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HAVE GONE OR OR WHATEVER AND REPLACED THEM
SO THE THE EYE THE THE LIST IS NOW UPDATED
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES UH
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH
WE'RE DOING A BIT
SEE LAST WEEK BY THE TIME EVERYTHING AND AND THEN IT'LL BE HOPEFULLY NO MORE THAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TWENTY MINUTES TODAY TO
HMM
YEP
I I YEAH
YOU MEAN FROM WAS THAT JOE
OR IS THAT
UM THERE WAS NOTHING NOTHING OVER LAST WEEK
JOE HAS UH PRODUCED ANOTHER VERSION OF THE UH MODEL BUILDER AND PUT THAT UP
UH WELL THAT WA THAT WAS RUUD WELL A FEW WEEKS AGO
BUT YEAH
YEP IT'S UNRELATED
AND WAS R WAS RUNNING
'CAUSE FRANK DID ALL THAT BECAUSE HE THEN HAD AN EXPERIMENT
SO HE'S RUN AN EXPERIMENT AND IT'S ALL WORKED
UH HE'S HE'S DONE HIS AND GOT HIS AND YES
AND HE BACKS UP ANYWAY
MAYBE TOO WELL PLACED YEAH
YEP
WH A SPARE HEAD
OR UH YES BUT SHE'S NOT AROUND
SO UH
NYNKE
MM-HMM
MM
WELL I DID MEET UH UH UH UH SOMEONE FROM ANOTHER PROJECT OF YOURS ON WEDNESDAY EVENING IT WAS
HEI HEIDI WHO IS THE GESTURE OF AUTISM
YEAH MM-HMM
MM YEP
AND AUTISM YEAH
YES
SH SHE'S BEEN VOLUNTEERED
YEP MAKE SURE IT UH IT STARTS AND FINISHES WHEN IT'S MEANT TO AND THAT SORT OF THING AS WELL
MM-HMM
UH YEP
UH YES WITH THE UM THE BLEEP WAS A HARDWARE BLEEP ORIGINALLY
AND SO IT COMES FROM THE P. C. WHICH IS OUTSIDE THE SOUND PROOF BOX
YES
H MM-HMM
IT COMES THROUGH THE
YEAH YEP
MM-HMM
NO
UH UM WHAT ELSE
YOU HAVE ALTERED THE UM TASK PROGRAMME BECAUSE UH TO PUT THE UM LITTLE EYE ICON AND THE MOUSE UH TO MAKE IT
RATHER THAN JUST A BLOB UH ELLEN WANTED SOMETHING TO LOOK MORE LIKE AN EYE SO THAT YOU KNEW THAT WAS THE EYE
THERE WAS LIKE YEAH MM-HMM
WANT IT A REASONABLE SIZE SO THAT IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT WE KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT THOUGH
SO YOU HAS TO BE A A REASONABLE TARGET UH FOR THE FOR THE TRACKING PURPOSES
MM-HMM
WITH LARGE MM YEAH I SUPPOSE THE LARGER MORE OSCILLATION APPEARS THAT UM IT'S NOT W I MEAN UH IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT ISN'T THAT BIG
SO YEAH
UH YES HE'S PRODUCED AN ANOTHER VERSION THAT DOESN'T UH HAVE THE OVERLAP PROBLEM
YOU KNOW THERE WAS THE YEAH THE COLLISIONS
THE POLYGONS NOW DON'T OVERLAP
UM MARLOES DISCOVERED SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THE ORIENTATION OF PARALLELOGRAMS FROM WHEN IT WAS CONSTRUCTED TO WHEN IT APPEARS IN THE UM ACTUAL TASK
BUT I THINK THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION THAN THE PARTS THAT WEREN'T THE SAME ACROSS THE TWO
SO I'LL CHECK THAT OUT UH TO SEE IF IT REALLY IS A PROBLEM OR NOT
AND BASICALLY THE PARALLELOGRAM WAS APPEARING IN A SORT OF AS A MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE UH MODEL BUILDER IN THE ACTUAL YEAH
JUST TOTAL IT FLIPPED UH IN IN A MIRROR IMAGE
NOT ROTATED
SO IT WASN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH ROTATION
IT WAS F YEAH JUST THE PARALLELOGRAM
SO UH ENTIRELY SURE
MUST BE SOME WAY OF HOW THE VERTICES WERE DESCRIBED OR UH DEFINED IN ONE WAY OR COMPARED TO SOMETHING ELSE
JOE YEP
WELL UH MM-HMM
YES
UH THE OTHER THING WE'VE DONE IS UH LOOKED AT N NOT UH FOR THIS CURRENT EXPERIMENT BUT FOR FUTURE
WHEN WE'VE GOT TO BUILD UM BIZARRE PARTS LIKE AIR CRAFT WINGS AND AND THINGS
UH SOMETHING LIKE X. FIG UH CAN OUTPUT THE VERTEX POINTS UM FOR CREATING THE AIR THE ACTUAL POLYGONS IN THE FIRST PLACE
'CAUSE THE MODEL BUILDER UM ASSUMES THAT THERE'S AN EXISTING SET OF OF ORIGINAL PARTS
SO YOU NEED TO DRAW THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE
SO
IT IT I YES
W OR SOMETHING I I UH UH
YEAH
SO IT MUST BE A SOME SORT OF PINK PACKAGE
UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM ANYWAY
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH BEFORE JOE DISAPPEARS JUST CHECKING THAT THE MODEL BUILDER'S NOT RESTRICTED TO JUST DOING THE TAMGRAMS
OR SOMETHING THA YOU KNOW
SO UH NO IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S UH M. S. N.
UM NO BUT AS LONG AS THEY'RE SOLID POLYGONS IT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT
UH NO IT SH WELL UH UH HOPEFULLY THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PARALLELOGRAM PROBLEM IS
BECAUSE IT IT DOES HAVE SORT OF SUM OF ANGLES AND THINGS
BUT UH NO AS FAR AS UH I MEAN IT
MM-HMM
YEAH
OR PART OF IT WAS CONVEX
YEAH
I Y YEAH BUT THAT'S WHY UH WE NO WE'LL ONLY BE WORKING AS I SAY WITH SORT OF SOLID OBVIOUS POLYGONS AND AS PARTS
'CAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THEY'LL HAVE TO HAVE A CENTRAL POINT ANYWAY FOR FOR ROTATION AND AND GRABBING
BUT
MM-HMM
WELL UH UH REALISE WHAT WE'RE I WOULD CONSIDER THAT TWO PARTS YEP
YEAH
YEP
THE LAST POINT TO THE YEAH
YEP
YES YEAH
J. P. IS QUITE YEAH UH-HUH
YES
THE MICROSOFT VERSION OF S. V. G. OR SOMETHING
YES UH-HUH
I HAVE NO IDEA EITHER
UH
NOPE
UH I THINK THEY'VE UM THEY'RE NOT WAITING ANYTHING FROM US
UH THEY'VE DUMPED THE PILOT THE PILOT STUDIES THAT THEY GENERATED BASED ON THE TASK WITH THEIR ENGLISH PARTICIPANTS OR ENGLISH SPEAKING PARTICIPANTS
YEAH
UH BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WITH IT OTHER THAN DUMP THE DATA
UH THEY WELL THEY DUMPED IT ON THE MM B. S. C. C. W. SERVER
BUT I'VE MOVED WELL I HAVEN'T MOVED IT I'VE COPIED IT ONTO THE C. S. V. YEAH
YEP
NOTHING FURTHER IS
NO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH
AND I'VE UH SENT A THING OFF TO MARLOES TALK TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HER AGAIN TO REGISTER FOR THE C. S. V. AND UH AND WHAT TO THE C. V. S. AND UH WHA WHAT TO DO AND UH WHICH BIT OF SOFTWARE I USE THAT SEEMS TO BE QUITE EASY AND SIMPLE
YEP
NOPE
WELL YES AND NO AS IN YES IT'S NEW AND NO I HAVEN'T GOT A PROBLEM
YEP
OH SO FAR
YEAH
UH-HUH
UH Y YES
UH AND I AM JUST USING IT THROUGH UM A WINDOWS BOLT ON SORT OF PIECE OF SOFTWARE
YEAH
NO I'VE JUST YEAH STRAIGHT FORWARD AND THEN YOU JUST RIGHT RIGHT YEAH R AND RIGHT CLICK THINGS IN IN WINDOWS EXPLORER
THAT'S IT
MM-HMM
ON A DAY LIKE THIS I KNOW IT'S A YEAH
MM NO
NOT AT THE MOMENT
THE ONLY THING THAT'S BEEN GOING AROUND IS THE VERSION OF THE FLIER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT REAL PURPOSE OF UH THESE LITTLE FOLDED UP A. FOUR FLIERS
UH THERE'S BEEN BIT OF UH ARE THEY JUST FOR DISTRIBUTION AT CONFERENCES AND THINGS
OR DO THEY UH
RIGHT
WELL I I'M NOT REALLY BOTHERING
BUT IT THERE'S THAT'S WHAT'S CIRCULATING AROUND THE THE GROUP AS A WHOLE AT THE MOMENT
UM I'VE SORTED OUT UH TRAVEL ET CETERA TO MUNICH FOR E FOR ELLEN JOHN AND MYSELF
AND WE'RE ALL OFF ON THE FOURTEENTH OF DECEMBER
COMING BACK ON THE FRIDAY
THE SIXTEENTH YES
THAT'S A SO THAT'S HOW TO HIRE OR HOW TO INTERVIEW IS THAT THAT UH BOOK
THE
SPEND
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL MM-HMM
UH WHAT EL UH WELL I'LL HAVE TO GET TO GRIPS WITH CRA CAMTASIA UH PROPERLY UH TO GENERATE A LITTLE SORT OF INTRODUCTORY VIDEO I SUPPOSE UH FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPERIMENT
SO PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE UH AND SO THAT THE P YOU KNOW EXAMPLE MOVEMENTS UH AND THINGS LIKE THAT WILL BE
IN DUTCH AS WELL
UM WELL
OH RIGHT
OH
HUH
RIGHT
UH NO THAT MUST HAVE BEEN BEFORE ME
SO UH UH UH P IT
I
SEPARATED
YES MM-HMM
YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH
EXA YEAH
SO THE I MEAN TH I DON'T THINK I THINK IT'D BE MORE SENSIBLE JUST TO DO THE NON THE THE VIDEO PART OF IT FIRST AND THEN YOU ADD THE VOICE OVER AFTERWARDS
RATHER THAN TRYING TO DO ALL AT ONCE
YOU KNOW
MIGHT USE
OR ARE YOU GOING TO PRIME THEM IN ANY WAY
DOING UH ANYTHING WITH THE VOICE YOU KNOW
IF YOU START TALKING ABOUT HAVE TO AVOID OR UH YEAH TALKING ABOUT THE PARTS OR JUST NAMING THEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
BEF YES
OKAY
OR DID NO N NO NOISE IN FACT I THINK IS PROBABLY UH YES
UH PRO PROBABLY ACTUALLY NOT EVEN THE SOUND EFFECTS 'CAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'LL EXPECT THAT IN THE REAL EXPERIMENT AND THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
SO IF THEY MAKE MOVE A PIECE AND IT BREAKS AND THEY DON'T HEAR THIS CRASH AND THEY GO OH WHAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED
IS THAT REALLY ALL WHAT HAPPENED
YEAH IT'S UH
MM-HMM
YEAH MM-HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
YES I THINK IT CAN GENERATE UH THINGS
UH-HUH
YES
MM MM-HMM YEAH
YES BUT UH OR IN OUR DISCUSSION WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED UH IT WAS ASSUMED THERE'D BE A VOICE OVER
BUT I'LL I'LL I BETTER I'LL I'LL REMIND HER YEAH I'LL I'LL I'LL DO THAT
MM-HMM
YES 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT TO THINK OF THE INSTRUCTIONS AND SORT OF BASIC INTRODUCTION TO IT ALL AS WELL
SO
ACTUALLY I I DID EMAIL NIJMEGEN TO ASK IF THEY'D HAD A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS THEY'D GIVEN THEIR PARTICIPANTS
BUT IT PROBABLY I S I SUSPECT SO BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD A REPLY BACK
YEAH TOO TOO UH IT WAS JUST IN CASE THEY HAD SOMETHING THAT WHAT
MM-HMM
NO THAT SHOULD BE A PROBLEM
I'LL BE STRAIGHT FORWARD ENOUGH I THINK
ALRIGHT YOU WANT TAKE IT BACK
UM OH UH T UH NO UM TH IT'S NOT GOT IT'S UH YEAH IT'S I WELL B ACTUALLY I COULD PROBABLY JUST PHOTO COPY THE MANUAL
AND THERE'S ONLY A
UM YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
UH OH I'VE HOPEFULLY WELL I WON'T HOPEFULLY NEED IT FOR MORE THAN ANOTHER WEEK OR TWO ANYWAY
SO AS LONG AS YOU CAN HOLD OFF HIS NO NO
RIGHT
UM I I WAS LOOKING AT THE THE COMPLEXITY SORT OF UH ASPECT OF THE TAMGRAMS IN THAT UH BOOKLET
IT'S NOT QUITE THAT THEY JUST GET HARDER
IT'S THAT THEY KIND OF HAVE PAGES OF SIMILAR UM TYPES
YEAH
SO ONE PAGE WILL HAVE SORT OF PARTS THAT ARE KIND OF SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER AND THEN YOU MOVE OVER AND THERE'S A DIFFERENT ALMOST TYPE OF DESIGN OR STYLE
UH SO IT'S NOT QUITE AS PROGRESSIVE IN COMPLEXITY AS UH
NO
GOOGLE
MM-HMM
UH I'LL TRY I'LL TRY
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S OUT THERE
WELL UH UM I'M HOPING THE DUTCH INPUT WILL ALLOW US TO P SORT OF HAVE A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT WAS THE OF A SUITABLE COMPLEXITY FOR THE TASK
UH NO NOT EVEN THAT
THEY'VE OF THIS RELEVANT TYPE TO WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO USE PROBABLY THREE
UH WE'VE TO GENERATE SIXTEEN IN TOTAL
MM-HMM
YEAH IDEALLY
MM NO
WELL I DON'T
I'M NOT
UH I'LL TR I'LL TRY THE GOOD OLD GOOGLE AND SEE IF THERE IS UH IF THERE ARE SOME SORT OF RANKING SITES OR WHATEVER
UH
I'LL TRY AND FIND OUT
I DON'T KNOW OFF OFF HAND CERTAINLY
UH I'LL I'LL DO A SEARCH
B UM I'VE NOT ENCOUNTERED THEM
MM WELL OR MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T USE MM ANYTHING LIKE THAT I SUPPOSE FOR
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF ANYTHING'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN
MM-HMM
AS LITTLE AS IT IS BUT YEAH
YEAH
YES
HAVE TO
TO TRY AND YES AND HOME HOME IN PARAMETERS AND CHOOSE THE RIGHT SORT OF SETTINGS
SO YEP
I'M SURE SHE'LL HAVE VIEWS ON IT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM OH I FOUND HAVEN'T FOUNT IT PHYSICALLY YET BUT UH A REFERENCE TO UH A NINETY TWO PAPER
IT'S IN THE ROYAL PROCEEDINGS OF SOMETHING OR OTHER SOMEWHERE BASED ON A UM AN EXPERIMENT THAT HAD BLOCKS A MODEL
BLOCKS OF PARTS AND THEN AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE HAD TO BUILD YOU KNOW REPLICATE THE MODEL OUT WITH THE PARTS
UH JUST ONE PERSON AT A TIME OF COURSE
BUT UH IT DID INVOLVE UM EYE MOVEMENTS AND MONITORING WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING COMPARED TO THEIR HAND MOVEMENTS AND UH THAT SUBJECT
BALLARD
BACK IN NINETY TWO
YES I THINK SO
UH THE I'LL MM NOT SURE
YEP
YEAH
SO THERE SHOULD STILL BE WELL NOT THAT ON
IS IT
Y UH-HUH
UH THAT'S WHAT I'VE M I'LL HAVE TO TRY AND FIND OUT
UH HMM
IF NOT UM THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IS BOUND TO HAVE IT
SHE'S NOT HERE NEXT WEEK ANYWAY
IT'S NEXT WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY BEFORE SHE'S BACK
OH IS THAT WHAT YEAH SHE'S GOT A MM YAHOO ACCOUNT OR SOMETHING THAT THINGS ARE GETTING FORWARDED TO AND
AH
OR OR OH WELL
THAT'S ONLY IF THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING THROUGH
AH
UM ANYTHING ELSE
WELL CERTAINLY
THE THE THERE'S THE PROVISIONAL LIST OF WHAT WE NEED ON THE WIKI ANYWAY THAT I PUT IT UP
SO
MM-HMM
UM WELL I I ADDED THINGS TO IT
WELL BETTER UH WELL I DON'T KNOW WHEN HE LAST LOOKED AT IT
BUT UH OR WHEN I ADDED IT
IT WAS SOMETIME IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS ANYWAY
BUT UH
MM-HMM
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GETTING
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH IT
IT'S THE IT'S THE DYNAMIC REGIONS THAT UH I THINK MIGHT CAUSE A BIT OF TROUBLE
BUT UH
THAT FILTER MM YEAH FILTER OUT
UNLESS Y
YEP I THINK SO
TO DO
HMM
WATCH OUT WELL I THINK ACCORDING TO THE LATEST DOCUMENTATION UH YOU'RE DOWN FOR FIVE PERCENT OF YOUR FIFTEEN MONTHS ON THIS PROJECT OR SOMETHING
SOME B UH JAST REPORT
OFFICIALLY
INTO REALITY UH-HUH
RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT
YEAH
YEAH
WELL UH I WAS EXPECTING TO GET YEAH THOUGH AND I DID DID MAKE IT IN TIME
BUT IT JUST JUST 'CAUSE ALL THE LEAVES AND THINGS
UM THE STRA THE TRAINS WEREN'T STOPPING AT THE STATIONS
SO THEY DECIDED TO PUT SPEED RESTRICTIONS ON
YEP
YEAH
'CAUSE APAR APAR APPARENTLY P UH I'M NOT SURE
UM THE AND THEY'RE BUSSING PEOPLE INTO STATION HAVE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS ON IT 'CAUSE IT'S ON A 'CAUSE IT'S ON A HILL OR SOMETHING
UM SO I HAD SO I HAD TO BUS PEOPLE IN FROM LIKE STATIONS EITHER SIDE
YES YES
BUT YEAH AT L AT LEAST IT WAS SPEED RESTRICTIONS INSTEAD OF LIKE TRAINS FLYING PAST INTO BARRIERS AND THINGS
SO
OH F YEAH
OKAY
WELL YOU KNOW APA PA APART FROM APART ALL APART FROM WAITING FOR THE GET GET CAMTASIA SORTED OUT
YEAH I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T ADDED ANYTHING TO THE WIKI RECENTLY
SO UH 'CAUSE I'VE WE'VE BEEN BEEN WORKING ON TRYING TO GET THE X. M. L. STUFF WORKING
SO SOME THE BA BASICALLY THEY ONLY HAD TO HOW THE DOM WORKS UM SO I CAN DO THE NEXT SO I CAN GE GENERATE D. D. F. FILES
HUH
UM SO SO TH YEAH SO JUST JUST BEEN READING THROUGH DOCUMENTATION
THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING THE END OF LAST WEEK UM JUST SO I KNOW HOW IT ALL WORKS AND FIGURING OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THINGS
UM BUT I'M AT THE MOMENT I'VE I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH THE DOM STUFF IN MOZILLA
UH 'CAUSE I 'CAUSE UH JU JUST SO AT LEAST I CAN SEE HOW IT WORKS WITH THE H. T. M. L. PAGES SO I CAN GENERATE UM THE X. SO I CAN GENERATE X. H. T. M. L. STUFF AND SEE HOW IT ALL WORKS THERE
JUST 'CAUSE TO JUST SEE HOW THINGS WORK IN THAT UM AND
IT WELL THING IS THAT THE A. THE A. WELL THE A. P. I. IS STANDARDIZED BY THE W. THREE C.
SO THE A. P. I. IS STAN IS STANDARD BETWEEN EVERYTHING
UM
UH OR
YEAH YEAH YEAH
IT IS
IT IT JUST HAS A COUPLE OF YEAH YEAH
UM WELL YEAH BUT IF THEY WILL B BUT IT DOE DOES LOOK LIKE IT DOES DOES THAT THIS IS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
SO I WAS DOING THE IS ANYWAY
UM IT'S JU IT'S JUST THAT THAT'S THAT'S QUITE A QUICK WAY TO JUST TO GET INTO HOW HOW WORKS
BECAUSE I CAN JUST QUICKLY GENERATE QUICKLY GENERATE A WEB PAGE AND THEN JUST ADD AND TAKE YEAH
ADD THINGS TO AND TAKE THINGS AWAY AND DON'T SEE EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE TIME
SO
OH WELL JUST 'CAUSE X. H. T. M. L. HAS A NICE YOU KNOW YOU GOT BROWSERS THERE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE DIRECTLY WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON
YEAH WELL I'LL I'M USING X. H. T. M. L. UH TO DETER THAT'S UH ALL ALL THE WEB PAGES ARE X. H. T. M. L.
SO IT'S X. M. L. JUST WITH THE H. T. M. L. D. T. D.
YEAH
JU JU JU JUST BA JUST 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T UH WE HAVEN'T F HAVEN'T QUITE FINALISED THE UM THE G. D. F. FORMAT
SO JUST JUST WELL JUST
YEAH YEAH
SO ALL HAVE TO DO IS JUST CHANGE IT CHANGE THAT SORT OF THING SO IT'S UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT
UM THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT I'M DOING THE MOMENT I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE S THE UH STUFF THAT ROBIN PUT ON THE WIKI TO SAY WHAT'S
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE NEED IN THE IN THE T UM IN THE OUTPUT FORMAT FOR THE FOR THE TASK YOU KNOW
SO WHAT WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO THE ANALYSIS ON
UM SO I'M MAKING SURE THAT I CAN TAKE GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE G. D. F. AS IT ST STATE OF THE MOMENT
AND IF I FIND SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT THEN I CAN ADD THAT TO THE ADD THAT TO THE G. D. F. FORMAT
SO
YEAH YEAH
YEAH WELL THE
WELL I'M I'M I'M JU TRY I'M MAKING SURE THAT THE G. D. F. FORMAT WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT WILL D WILL OUTPUT SAY WELL I'VE OUTPUT OLD ANALYSIS THAT THAT ROBIN'S LOOKING FOR
UM SO SO I'M USING THAT AS A WAY TO TO GET INTO HA HA USING THE DOM THINGS AS WELL
UM SO YEAH
SO AT THE MOMENT I'M LOOKING AT ACT ACTUALLY THE G. D. F. FORMAT ITSELF UM AND THEN TO GENERATE THE G. D. F. FORMAT I'M GONNA BE TAKING STUFF OUT OF THE GEST ANALYSER UM AND THEN USING A DOM PARSER TO GENERATE UH X. M. L. OUTPUT FROM THE GEST ANALYSER
UH NO
NO
BUT UH I'LL WHEN AND OUT OF THE OUTPUT OF THE GEST ANALYSER DOES DOES DO SOME OF THE PROCESSING ALREADY
WHICH IS WHAT I'LL M PLAN TO USE THAT AS THE BASIS FOR IT
'CAUSE THAT ALREADY THAT ALREADY PICKS UP LIKE TARGET REGIONS THINGS LIKE THAT
SO YOU GET SO SO IT KNOWS WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PART OR WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT TARGET AREA OR WHAT OR WHATEVER
UM SO YES AS LONG AS IT GOT THAT IN IT SOMEWHERE
SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PULLING THAT OUT AND PUT THAT INTO THE UM INTO THE G. D. F. STUFF
YEP
YEAH UM BU
YEAH YEAH
I UM I THINK THE O THE ONLY THING I'VE GOT LEFT TO DO BEFORE THE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE RUN IS GET S IS GET THE CHECK CAMTASIA WORKS
UM NOW I'VE GOT CAMTASIA RUNNING ON MACHINES AND I THINK THEY'RE SET UP CORRECTLY
BUT I CAN'T TEST IT UNTIL WE GET THE MICROPHONES WORKING
MICROPHONES
'CAUSE
AH
WELL HE MUST SOME THESE DAYS ANYWAY ISN'T IT
SO SO
YEAH
SO WE ALL GOT OFF EASY
YEAH
AH WELL CA I CAN EASY I CAN EASY GET TO MAPL UH TO MAPLIN I KNOW WHERE IT IS OFF I USED TO LIVE THERE
SO I KNOW I KNOW WHERE I USED TO LIVE HERE
I'M A GEEK
I KNOW WHERE I KNOW WHERE MAPLIN IS
YEAH
WELL I SUPPOSE I COULD GI I COULD GIVE YOU A CALL ON THE WAY IN TOMORROW AND IF TH NOT BI IT'S NOT BEEN IN YOUR IN YOUR F UM PIGEON HOLE
I CAN EASY GO OFF THE TRAIN AND EARLY AND JUST PICK 'EM UP FROM THERE
RIGHT YEAH
WELL I'LL MAKE SURE I MAKE A I'LL MAKE SURE OF I GOT THE F THE PHONE NUMBER IN MY PHONE SO I CAN CALL THEM
ALL TRUE
TRUE
UM UH IT'S DALRY ROAD ISN'T IT
UM
YEP
I T I'D SAY YOU DON'T BE
MM
YEAH YEAH
SCREEN SHOTS
YEAH YEAH
OH
HMM
WELL I'M I'M USING DICE MACHINES
IF HE WANTS TO POP IN FOR FIVE MINUTES THE THE WINDOWS MACHINE IS FREE FOR HIM AT THE MOMENT
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN I CONSIDERING WE GET AN EMAIL FROM UH THE I THINK IT GOT SENT THROUGH SAYING THAT HE'D UPDATED THE THE WHATEVER IT WAS ON THE WIKI
SO YOU DO HE'D HE'D UPLOADED A NE A NEW ZIP FILE AND OVERWRITTEN THE OLD ONE
SO
YEP
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL WHEN THE WHOLE THING WAS IF IT WAS GONNA RUN A TRIAL THAT'LL GIVE YOU SOME SOME SCREEN SHOTS TO WORK WITH
AND THEN IT'LL JUST BE A MATTER OF ADDING NEW VIDEO F MOUSE MOVEMENTS OR WHATEVER
SO
UH HAVE A LOOK
IF YOU TH ANYTHING PROB ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT UM THINK THERE'S A WIKI PAGE UP FOR THAT F FOR THAT PIECE OF UH FOR YEAH FOR THAT THING
SO IF IF YOU JUST PUT JUST PUT WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS BUGS ON THAT PAGE AND I'LL WORK THROUGH THEM READ 'EM AS AND WHEN I CAN
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
UM
YEAH
AND LIKE THESE YEAH I MEAN I'VE USED THE SOFTWARE AND THERE'S NOT THAT HARD I MEAN
UH
YEAH
IF
YEAH
SO WELL I CAN'T IMAGINE THE BUILDING THE BUILDING THE MOLD IS GONNA BE THAT HARD
I MEAN I CAN EASILY JUST WELL HOWEVER MANY THOUSANDS ARE ON THAT UH DUTCH WEB SITE YOU FOUND
JUST YOU KNOW PICK PICK SOME OF THEM REDO THEM IN IN THE JA IN THE J. C. D. FORMAT
THAT'S YEAH
IT'S PRETTY MECHANICAL
I CAN EASILY D EASILY DO THAT
SO BUT IT'S A MATTER OF CHOOSING WHICH ONES YOU NEED TO DO
WHICH I GUESS YOU HAVE TO DO
WELL YEAH
YEAH WELL YOU NEED TO YOU YOU AND MARLOES NEED TO SORT OUT YEAH
UM I DON'T THINK DON'T THINK SO
I MEAN UH SO THE THE MAJOR THING I'VE GOTTA D GOT TO DO IS GET THIS CAMTASIA SORTED OUT
SO JUST WAITING FOR THE BATTERIES FOR THAT
UM IF ROBIN'S NOT WORRIED I'M NOT WORRIED
UM
UM P
YEAH YEAH 'CAUSE I'LL GO GOTTA FINALISE THAT FORMAT AND THEN ONCE THAT'S DONE I'VE GOTTA START LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS SIDE OF IT
AND THAT'S
YEAH
UM
YEAH YEAH
I THINK YEAH
NO THE THE ANALYSIS I THINK THE ANALYSIS WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE THAT LONG TO GET ITS STUFF SORTED OUT
IT'S GONNA BE HOW TO DISPLAY IT AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF
UH WHATEVER MAKES IT EASIEST FOR YOU TO DO
UM BUT ONCE W
HMM
YEAH YEAH
UM YEAH SO I STILL GOTTA WORK ON THE GEST ANALYZER AND TURN THAT INTO THE T INTO A G. D. F. OUTPUTTER
UM AND UH OH YEAH AND I'LL I CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE MODEL BUILDER AS WELL
UM 'CAUSE ONE THING I'M THINKING ABOUT IS W WE'RE LOOKING AT THE THE PART BUILDING PA TYPE STUFF
UH AND IT MIGHT WORTH SEEING IF WE CAN ADD A LITTLE PART BUILDER THING INTO THE UM MODEL BUILDER
UM JUST JUST THE JU I JUST GOTTA TIDY TIDY UP SOME THE CODE FOR GENERATING THE PARTS ANYWAY THE J. C. T. UM PARTS FROM FROM S. V. G. S
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
BUT I'LL WANNA HAVE A QUI HAVE A QUICK LOOK AND SEE SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO ADD THIS THINGS TO IT
'CAUSE UM IF IF I CAN USE IT TO GENERATE UM UM THE ROTSYM ANGLE FOR EXAMPLE AND THE ROTATION SYMMETRY STUFF FOR IT
WHICH IS WHAT WAS CAUSING THE BUGS UH BEFORE
UM SO IF I IF I CAN USE THE MODEL BUILDER TO AUTOMATICALLY DO THAT THEN THAT WOULD SA THAT WOULD SAVE QUITE A BIT OF WORK AND IT'LL D SAVE A FEW BUGS
SO
NO
IT'S UH IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU GOTTA REMEMBER ONCE THE PART'S BEEN BUILT
SO UM
YEAH YEAH
WELL I'M NOT NOT NOT PL NOT PLANNING DO MUCH ON THAT
IT'S JUST
YEAH
I MEAN I'VE I'VE ALREADY I'VE ALREADY GOT THIS YEAH
YEAH OTHER I SAW SAW SAW SAW SOMETHING ABOUT MAP TASK LIKE LITTLE FURTHER DOWN MY TASK LIST
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH WELL THAT THAT'S THAT'S JUST X. M. L. TO X. M. L. TO X. M. L. ISN'T IT
TURNING G. D. F. AND WHAT OTHER BITS INTO N. X. T.
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT RIGHT
UM YEAH 'CAUSE THAT'S THE YEAH O OTHER THAN YOU HAVE FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT IS BOTH X. M. L.
SO THE THE PROGRAMMING SIDE OF IT DOESN'T SOUND TOO HARD
IT'S GONNA BE MAKING SURE THAT IT FITS WHAT YOU EXPECT OUT OF THE FORMAT
SO UM BUT NO THAT'S THAT'S FINE
I'LL D I'LL HAVE TRY TO FIND I'LL I'LL HAVE PLEN PLENTY OF UH PLENTY OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU ONCE I ONCE I GET TO THE LAST STAGE
I'M SURE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WE'LL
YEAH
WELL THE WE'RE GONNA GET CAMTASIA SORTED OUT THIS WEEK AND THEN IT'S CONCENTRATE ON THE ON THE GEST ANALYZER THE G. D. F. STUFF
UM AND THEN YEAH
ONCE ONCE WE'VE DONE THAT IT'S WHATEVER WHATEVER YOU WHATE WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU WANT ME DO ONCE I DONE THE ONCE I'VE DONE THE G. D. F. I GUESS
YEP
YEAH SO I THINK THE G. D. F. WILL KEEP ME BUSY FOR A LITTLE WHILE YET
SO UM YEAH WELL THAT'S YEAH
CERTAINLY KEEP ME BUSY UNTIL THIS TIME NEXT WEEK WHEN WE CAN START SUGGESTING THINGS THAT MIGHT MIGHT NEED TO LOOK AT FOR THE NEXT STAGE I GUESS
YEP
OKAY
YEAH
FOR THE FIRST YEAH
YEAH
HMM
ACTUALLY YEAH THAT REMINDS ME I WO WO I WO I WON'T BE UH ON THURSDAY I'M GONNA BE OVER IN MY INDUCTION DAY
SO SO
FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH
I MEAN UH I DON'T IT'S MEANT TO BE THAT IN DEPTH
IT'S
YES YES
I MEAN I D I DON'T EXPECT TO BE THAT IN DEPTH
I MEAN IT'S FIFTEEN MINUTES ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TOPICS
SO IT'S JUST IT'S UH IT IS
UH YES IT IS
I'M SURE MOST OF IT I ALREADY KNOW
IT'S LIKE FIRE SAFETY
YEAH
HEALTH SAFETY DATA PROTECTION
USUAL SORT OF STUFF YOU GET EVERYWHERE
SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH I MEAN I CAN REMO
YEAH I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I START BEING A ST WHEN I WAS STA STARTING BEING A STUDENT
I MEAN HA WE HAD THE INDUCTIONS WERE COMPULSORY BECAUSE UM A LOT OF STUDENTS WERE DOING TE WERE DOING TEACHING
AND YOU COULDN'T DO THE TEACHING UNLESS YOU DONE THE INDUCTION BECAUSE YOU HAD TO KNOW ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY AND FIRE SAFETY BEFORE YOU COULD TAKE A CHARGE OF YEAH
'CAUSE YOU WERE THE RESPONSIBLE PERSON IN THE IN THE CLASS ROOM
SO
SO BUT UH YEAH I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE WHY THE WHY WHY I'M DOING IT NOW
BUT OKAY
SO SEE HOW IT GO
I'LL I'LL UH GIVE YOU MY REPORT ON FRIDAY OR SOMETHING
YEAH
HUH
OKAY
SO SO THAT MEAN YOU NEED THE BLINK CORRECTIONS PART OF THE ANALYSIS THEN
UM
RIGHT
SO THA THA THAT'S UH THAT'S FOR THE REST OF THE STUFF THAT COMES THE EYE TRACKER ISN'T THE ANALYZER SOFTWARE THAT COMES THE EYE TRACKER
RIGHT
RIGHT OKAY
WELL I I IF IF YOU WANT IF YOU WANT THE BLINKS MER MERGED INTO A FIXATION
IT MIGHT WORTH MAKING MAKING A CR PART OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE G. D. F. STUFF
SO TO REMIND ME SO TO TO JUST ADD THAT ANALYSIS TO YEAH TO TO IT
SO IT'S I MEAN IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO DO JUST CHE JUST CHECKING THE TIMES TH TIMES OF THE EVENTS
RIGHT
OKAY OKAY
YEAH
YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK THE ASCII FORMAT AS IT STANDS DOES CONTAIN BLINK INFORMATION UM 'CAUSE UH D D I'M SURE I'M SURE THAT'S APPEARED IN THE IN THE DOCUMENTATION I'VE READ THROUGH
POSSIBLY
POSSIBLY YEAH
RIGHT
OKAY OKAY
UM YEAH
SO MIGHT MIGHT WORTH US US HAVING A LOOK AT THAT AND JUST JUST SEEING WHAT DAT IS WHAT DATA IS ALREADY IN THE ASCII FORMAT AND WHETHER YOU WANT ME TO DO ANY CORRECTION AS PART OF THE ANALYSIS
UM 'CAUSE I'VE GOTTA DO THE ANALYSIS FOR THE FIXATIONS ON PARTS AND THINGS ANYWAY
SO YEAH I D I I I DIDN'T THINK CHECK FOR BLINKS DURING THAT
ISN'T GONNA BE A SHOULDN'T BE A BIG PROBLEM
YEAH
YEP
UM SO WE'LL BE
RIGHT MM-HMM
AND SO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A FINAL THING THAT JUST SORT SAYS BETWEEN THIS TIME AND THIS TIME YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS OBJECT
BETWEEN THIS TIME THIS TIME YOU'RE NOT LOOKING ANYTHING
AND
YEAH YEAH
'CAUSE I THINK I THINK AT THE MOMENT THE G. D. F. FORMAT HAS FIXATIONS IN IT
UM SO SO I GUE I GUESS THAT'D BE PART OF THE G. D. F. TO TRANSFORMATION WOULD BE TURNING FIXATIONS INTO GAZES AND WHATEVER ELSE
OKAY OKAY
WELL THA THA DON'T DON'T UH WORRY ABOUT THAT JUST THE MOMENT
BUT
RIGHT
RIGHT
SO SO SO W WILL YOU ACTUALLY BE DOING MUCH OF THE G. D. F.
OR IS ARE YOU EXPECTING DO MOST THE ANALYSIS ON OUT OF THE N. X. T. STUFF THEN
SO WHE WHEN YOU UH WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GENERATE YOUR RESULTS
MM-HMM
RIGHT
YEAH
UH YEAH
C WELL YEAH
YOU TOLD THAT EARLIER 'CAUSE YOU COULD DO A QUICK ANA YOU COULD DO A QUICK ANALYSIS ON THE G. D. F. STUFF WITHOUT HAVING TO BEFORE YOU HIT BEFORE YOU DO THE DIALOGUE ANALYSIS TYPE STUFF
SO YOU CAN GET SOME SOME RESULTS ANYWAY CAN'T YOU
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT
OKAY OKAY
RIGHT
OH YEAH YEAH
THE GERMANS DON'T YEAH YEAH YEAH
FAIR ENOUGH FAIR EN
YEAH SO SO THEY THEY WE'RE ALLOWED TO DO WHATEVER WITHOUT WITHOUT SOURCE CODE
THERE'S NO C SORT OF RESTRICTIONS ON THAT
FAIR ENOUGH FAIR ENOUGH
YEAH I SUPPOSE I CAN EASY LOOK THROUGH AND START WRITING UP SOME DOCUMENTATION ON IT
THAT'LL GI THAT'LL GIVE US A STARTING POINT FOR US TO SORT TO TALK ABOUT IT TO LOOK FOR WHAT ANALYSIS WE N ACTUALLY NEED TO DO ON IT AND THINGS
UM YEAH EASY
C YEAH CREATE ALL THE UH SWITCHES AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU NEED TO DO
SO UM
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
SO WE'LL ON ONCE YEAH
WELL ONCE I'VE HAD ONCE I'VE HAD A BIT OF BIT MORE LOOK AT THIS G. D. F. STUFF THEN START LOOKING THROUGH THAT
START LOOKING THROUGH THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT WORKS
'CAUSE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I'VE L YEAH I'VE NO NO NOTICED THAT THE THE THE GEST ANALYSER KNOWS QUITE A FEW THINGS AS WELL
SO UM BUT AS
YEAH
WELL UH I USE IT THAT USEFUL FOR GENERATING THIS G. D. F. STUFF
I CAN EASILY INCORPORATE WHATEVER FUNCTIONS IT TAKES FROM INTO GEST ANALYSER WHEN I'M DO DOING THE G. D. F. STUFF
SO
YEAH YEAH
I MEAN BUT WHAT YEAH SAY WHAT WHAT I'LL WHAT I'LL PLAN TO DO WITH IT THEN IS TAKE THE IS TAKE TO THE SOFTWARE
FIND OUT WHAT FUNCTIONS ARE USEFUL FOR US IN THAT
AND THEN USE THOSE FUNCTIONS TO GENERATE THE STUFF THAT GOES INTO THE X. M. L. FILE THE THE G. F. FORMAT
YEAH YEAH
SO SO THE FIR FIR FIRST PART THAT'LL BE DOCUMENTING WHAT THEY'VE GOT AND THEN DISCUSSING IT WITH ROBIN
SO UH YEAH
SO SO I SUPPOSE POSE THAT THAT WAY THE
RIGHT
BUT YEAH WELL I TR MO MOSTLY YEAH
I'M SURE I SURE MOST THE LOGIC'S GONNA BE GONNA BE THE SAME
SO UM
RIGHT
YEAH FAIR ENOUGH
YEAH FAIR ENOUGH
WELL SO SO IT'S SO LONG AS IT'S X. M. L. N. X. T. WILL HANDLE IT WON'T IT
'CAUSE
YEP
FAIR ENOUGH
OKAY OKAY
YEAH
WELL I'M WELL I'M WELL G I'VE GOT THE HANG OF ALL THE STUFF I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
AND IT LOOKS LIKE L LOOKS LIKE I'M COMING TO END OF THE STUFF THE STUFF LIST THERE ALREADY
SO I'M GONNA HAVE START LOOKING AT THAT AS THE NEXT STAGE
SO
YEP
WELL I MA I MA I MAY BE MAYBE I WANT TO CHECK OUT THESE BATTERIES AND THINGS WON'T I
SO TOMORROW
WELL THAT'LL BE SOMETHING TO DO
WELL WELL WILL THE WILL THE WILL WILL DO IF THE TRAINS ARE THA AS BAD AS TODAY
SO
I MEAN IF YOU'RE EVER YOU KNOW LATE 'CAUSE OF THAT IT'S NOT WE'LL FIND A WAY AROUND IT
AND I'VE PUT YOU GUYS ON MONDAYS AT THIS TIME FOR MY CONVENIENCE BUT IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
REALLY
I REALLY
GREAT
I WAS TH SO WHAT'D THEY HAVE TO DO BACK UP
AH
NASTY
YEAH YEAH
GO I WE'RE GLAD THEY'LL LOOK AFTER THAT BIT
UH I DON'T KNOW
DO WE WANNA LOOK AT ANYTHING
IT'S NOT UP YET
I CAN
OH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING
OOPS THAT FELL OFF
DOESN'T LIKE SILK
STAY
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA DISCOVER WE'VE GOT NO REASON TO MEET RIGHT
'CAUSE EVERYTHING'S GOING SWIMMINGLY
OH
'CAUSE UH I HAVEN'T BEEN I HAVEN'T READ THE WIKIS IN MY EMAIL SINCE I LEFT
SO UM
OH YEAH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UM THE OH WELL UM I DON'T KNOW THE MOZILLA STUFF
SO IF IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S IDIOSYNCRATIC IN SOME WAY THAT TEACHES YOU FUNNY HABITS THEN IT WON'T HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA
SO
YEAH YEAH
UH WELL Y TH THERE ARE CERTAIN COMPANIES UM THAT I DON'T WANNA NAME WHO DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT
I C BUT M YEAH MOZILLA
YEAH IT'LL BE ALRIGHT
SO OKAY
I BELIEVE YOU NOW IT'S A GOOD STRATEGY
MM-HMM
UH WH WHY DOES IT HELP THAT IT'S X. T. H. T. M. L. INSTEAD OF JUST X. M. L.
YEAH BUT MOST M MOST BROWSERS WHEN WHEN YOU UH PUT AN X. M. L. FILE UP IN IT
IT'LL JUST APPLY SOME DEFAULT STYLE SHEET TO IT ANYWAY THAT SHOWS YOU
OKAY YEAH
OKAY SO ALL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IS SWAP IN TAG NAMES LATER
OKAY
EV EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THESE THINGS
I'M SURE THAT'S FINE
LIKE HAVING TO UH G IT'S
YEAH
NO I'M JUST TRY I'M TRYING TO L THINK OF THE THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG
UM BUT SINCE I HAVEN'T TRIED IT THIS PARTICULAR WAY YOU KNOW UM BUT YEAH THAT SOUNDS GOOD
SO UM I SO YOU SAY WE HAVEN'T FINALISED WHAT THE G. D. F. LOOKS LIKE
IS THAT AN IMPLICIT REQUEST FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING
OR
UH-HUH
YEAH
AS A WELL I MEAN THERE'S TWO TWO CASES IN HERE RIGHT
THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN GET STRAIGHT OFF THE ORIGINAL FORMAT AND THEN THERE'S THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO SOME KIND OF POST PROCESSING OF THE ORIGINAL FORMAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A DATA FORMAT CHANGE IT'S ACTUALLY SOME KIND OF COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS TO GET THE THING OUT OF IT AS WELL RIGHT
AND IT WASN'T UH Y I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE BIT UM CONFUSED UH LAST TIME WE SPOKE ABOUT UM WHETHER
U WHETHER YOU CONSIDER G. D. F. FORMAT TO BE UM THE THING THAT'S JUST THE STRAIGHT FORWARD TRANSLATIONS OF WHAT'S IN THE ORIGINAL EYE TRACKING OUTPUT
OR WHETHER LIKE WHETHER THE POST PROCESSING UTILITIES ARE A SEPARATE STEP
'CAUSE I THINK YOU AND I HAD SEPARATE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER W WHO HAD WHICH VIEW AT THIS POINT
SO Y ARE YOU WORKING UH ACTIVELY ON THIS ANAL THESE ANALYSIS THINGS OR YOU JUST WORKING ON THE TRANSLATION
UH SO THE DATA FORMAT TRANSLATION
OH OKAY
SO YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT WHAT'S IN THERE AND WHAT ISN'T IN THERE THAT YOU NEED TO DO SOME REALLY INTENSIVE TRANSFORM TO DO
NOT YET OH OKAY
YEAH
UH-HUH
OKAY
SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S UNDER CONTROL AND YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU GUYS ARE TELLING EACH OTHER WHAT YOU GUYS NEED TO KNOW
SO I DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING RIGHT
YOU'RE ALL FINE
BUT THERE WAS A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CAME BEFORE THIS RIGHT THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE NOT UNDER CONTROL YET
SO SO YOU KNOW THE G. D. F. STUFF WITH SO I ELLEN'S VIEW ON THIS IS WE GO THROUGH EVERYTHING IN ORDER
LIKE THE PRIORITY IS EXACTLY THE PIPE LINE ORDER RIGHT
SO UM CAMTASIA YOU MENTIONED
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE BUT WE SHOULD CHECK WHAT OTHER THINGS WERE BEFORE THIS ON THE LIST OF THINGS TO DO
UNTIL YOU GET THE OH MICROPHONES
BATTERIES
OKAY UH ARE THEY REALLY REALLY STRANGE BATTERIES
HAVE YOU TRIED MAPLIN
ARE THEY EXPENSIVE
'CAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE A WEE BUS JOURNEY OVER TO MAPLIN MIGHT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF IT'S GETTING IN THE WAY
SO THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY UM RUINING YOUR SCHEDULE FOR ANYTHING AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE WAITING
RIGHT OKAY
IT IS I SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE M YEAH
WHEN YOU GET WORRIED GO TO MAPLIN OKAY
PHONE THEM FIRST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN THERE
SOMEBODY AROUND MUST HAVE A UH PROBABLY STEVE
SOMEBODY IN THE TECHIE GROUP WILL HAVE A MAPLIN CATALOGUE
FACT I'LL SEE IF I CAN UM YEAH IT'S USEFUL TO KNOW WHO'S GOT A CURRENT ONE ANYWAY
I DON'T SEEM TO GET THEM ANYMORE
I GUESS I DON'T BUY ENOUGH EQUIPMENT
OH YEAH
OF COURSE
DUH
SO YOU CAN FIND OUT WHETHER THEY HAVE IT
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO PHONE OVER TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE IT IN STOCK DOWN THERE
I ACTUALLY LIVE NOT THAT FAR FROM THERE
UM SO
IT WOULD BE A HALF HOUR UM DIVERSION FROM MY MORNING ROUTINE TO PICK UP STUFF
UH W BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S ALSO VERY CLOSE TO HAYMARKET SO IT'S EVEN LESS OF A DIVERSION FOR YOU PROBABLY
EXCEPT YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND
AH YEAH
OH YEAH C YEAH
YEAH
I JUST THINK WELL YOU KNOW FOR THE SAKE OF THREE QUID OR HOWEVER MANY QUID IT HOW MANY BATTERIES DOES THIS THING TAKE
DOESN'T TAKE A HUNDRED
YEAH THEN YOU KNOW PUT YOUR MIND AT REST
'CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT TO BE THE MORNING YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE RECORDING AND THEN SUDDENLY DISCOVER YEAH
YOU KNOW THIS
UH CHECK THEY GOT 'EM FIRST THOUGH
THEIR STOCKS ARE A BIT FUNNY DOWN THERE
'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE AN AREA TO WALK THROUGH IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT
SO OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE ON THE WIKI DO I NEED TO PULL UP THE WIKI
AH IT IS GONNA LET ME LOG IN
NO I DO NOT WANNA CHANGE MY PASSWORD
UM
BUT YOU GUYS PROBABLY KNOW OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE WE WE WERE WAITING ON BEFORE YOU COULD RUN
SO ALL THOSE TASKS CRAIG HAD WHEN IT STARTED
UH HIS LAST DAY WAS THE THIRTY FIRST OF OCTOBER
UH YEAH NO NO
IT'S OURS
YEAH IT'S OURS
OH SO HE'S GOT OURS LEFT
HE'S BEHIND HAND
BUT NO HE WAS BILLING FOR HE WAS BILLING BY THE HOUR
SO I THOUGHT WELL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF HE WANTS TO FINISH OFF THEN YOU KNOW
OH WELL THEY'RE PROBABLY AWAY THEN
WASN'T ELLEN AWAY
THEY'RE REALLY AT THE SAME PLACE
OH YEAH IT COULD BE IT
OH YOU HAVE NO MODELS AT ALL
OH THAT'S A PITY
MODEL BUIL BUILDER THAT'S WHAT I WAS CALLING THE GRAPHICAL MODEL EDITOR RIGHT
SO YOU USE X. FIG TO MAKE THE PARTS AND THEN YOU THIS THING
OH OKAY
YEP
OKAY
UM I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY EMAIL ABOUT FROM JOE
UH HE WOULDN'T HAVE SENT IT JUST TO ME WOULD HE
DO YOU WANT ME TO CHECK THAT
I'M NOT GONNA PROJECT MY EMAIL
OKAY I THINK I MIGHTA HEARD THURSDAY OR SOMETHING
I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN IT WAS
UH
OKAY SO I'VE GOT SOMETHING ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH
THAT'S FRIDAY I THINK
OH HE JUST WANTS TO KNOW HOW TO GET PAID
RIGHT
THAT SUGGESTS HE'S DONE DONE DONE
ANYWAY HE'S IN EDINBURGH
SO WELL I SUPPOSE HE WON'T COME BY 'CAUSE CRAIG'S ON HIS DESK
YEAH
SO
WELL HE'S JUST NOT GONNA TRY TO LE SQUAT THERE THAT'S ALL
UH WELL I SO THE LAST THING I'VE GOT FROM HIM ABOUT WORK WORK WAS THE NINETEENTH OF OCTOBER THAT SAID HE UPLOADED SOME CHANGES THAT YOU WANTED
THAT'S
OH SO YOU DIDN'T GET THAT
IT WAS ME AND HIM
BUT PRESUMABLY THE HE PUT IT ON THE WIKI
SO
SO HE'S JUST TELLING US 'CAUSE HE THINGS WE PROBABLY DON'T READ WIKIS
AND I'LL JUST CHECK
YEAH
WELL I I HAVEN'T REPLIED TO HIM ABOUT YEAH I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE MORE RECENT FROM HIM
S I HAVEN'T REPLIED TO HIM ABOUT UM
YOU KNOW HOW TO SUBMIT COSTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO UM BUT THAT SUGGESTS HE'S AT AT THE END OF THINGS BUT W WE COULD JUST ASK HIM
I MEAN MAYBE YOU GUYS WOULD JUST WANNA ASK HIM DIRECTLY YOU'RE DONE DONE RIGHT
'CAUSE UM IT'S WORTH YOU GUYS KNOWING
AND THEN OF COURSE ANY PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN YOU INHERIT
UH RIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES AND MAKING SURE IT DOES WHAT YOU WANT I GUESS
SO TH THE PROBLEM IS YOU WANT YOU WANTED TO CONSTRUCT SOME MODELS IN IT FOR YOUR EXPERIMENT BUT YOU WERE HOPING TO GET SOME FROM MARLOES
AH YEAH YEAH
RIGHT HAVE YOU YOU TRIED COLD CALLING HER
THAT'S WHAT I DO WHEN I NEED THINGS THAT
ACH TRY PHONE
WHEN I IF YOU GET 'EM TODAY WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START RUNNING
OH RIGHT
SO YOU HAVE TO BE YOU HAVE TO BE READY BY THEN
YEAH OR RE CHANGE THE SCHEDULE
RIGHT OKAY
UH-HUH YEAH
MAKES SENSE
UM SUBJECTS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE D
YEAH
SO S Y Y YOU DON'T HAVE SUBJECTS LINED UP BUT YOU DON'T EXPECT ANY TROUBLE GETTING THEM
MM-HMM
YEAH
BY
UM I DON'T KNOW THIS PERSON
SO THEY WELL THEY NEED TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT
WHO WHO'S THEIR IS THAT A STAFF MEMBER OR A STUDENT
OKAY
UM WELL WE KINDA PAID FOR THE LAB
SO IT DEPENDS BUT I SUPPOSE TALKING TO THEM SOMETIMES SOLVES THESE PROBLEMS
UM YOU MIGHT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT SORT OF STAFF MEMBER IS IT
IS IT A
RIGHT
UM I MEAN PRESUMABLY HE OR SHE IS NOT RUNNING SUBJECTS THE ENTIRE
BLOCK BOOK FOR HOW LONG
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UM SO UH UM ELLEN'S STILL OUT OF TOWN RIGHT
IT'S JUST UH Y YOU COULD TRY CALLING THIS PERSON AND SEE HOW THIS WORKS
ELLEN MIGHT BE MORE PERSUASIVE
UM IT'S JUST SOMETIMES UH ACADEMIC STAFF HAVE A BIT OF A CHIP ABOUT UM RESEARCH STAFF
AND SINCE I DON'T KNOW THE PERSON I CAN'T TELL WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THOSE OR NOT
MM-HMM
YEAH AND THEN ESCALATE I GUESS
BUT UH YOU KNOW OR WHETHER THEY CAN BE PUT OFF FOR A LITTLE BIT OR SOMETHING
SO I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE BOOKING SYSTEM WORKS
WELL YOU'RE DISCUSSING IT ON THURSDAY RIGHT
AT THE MOMENT THERE'S JUST A BOOKING SYSTEM
YEAH
YEP
WELL THAT'S THAT'S ONE TO RAISE AT THE MEETING
UM I V MIGHT TALK TO ELLEN ABOUT THAT AHEAD OF TIME 'CAUSE UH THEY MAY HAVE SHE AND MARTIN MAY HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT APPROPRIATE USE OF THE LAB
OH REALLY
YEAH BUT I G DON'T YOU GUYS SET UP FOR ISN'T BLOCK BOOKING MORE APPROPRIATE
BECAUSE
I I ISN'T THERE SET UP INVOLVED IN CHANGING AROUND FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
NO
OR IN THE SOFTWARE OR ANYTHING
OKAY
SO THERE'S NO COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT BEING MORNINGS OR AFTERNOONS
YEAH
S SO IN THE WORST CASE UM YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT IF YOU ACTUALLY NEED THAT WEEK THAT YOU CAN COLLECT IN THE MORNINGS THAT WEEK
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S KNOWN OUTSIDE ELLEN'S HEAD
IT'S ON THE W BOOKING SYSTEM
OH WELL
THAT'S SOMETHING
UH-HUH
WELL MOST THE TIME TO TO P YEAH
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF POSSIBLE WAYS OF GETTING WHAT TIME YOU NEED
OF COURSE TRY TO BE KIND TO OTHER PEOPLE
BUT YOU WOULD ANYWAY
SO
SO THOSE ARE THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE WORRYING YOU CAMTASIA AND LAB ACCESS
AND OTHERWISE NO SWEAT YOU'RE HAPPY
OH AND THE MODEL BUILDERS YEAH
OH YEAH
H UH-HUH
THESE THIS IS GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT YOU WERE GONNA TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO OVERLAY SOMETHING ON TOP OF THE VIDEO THAT OR NO
YOU WERE JUST G REALLY GONNA RUN A VIDEO OF THE SEP OF THE TRIAL
YEAH OKAY
THAT'S THAT'S MUCH EASIER
SO UM WITH THE MODEL BUILDER WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WITH IT
TH THE UM WHICH ONE YOU IS GONNA LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES SO FAR AND YOU'LL JUST T TRY OUT DO THAT
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
UM HOW MANY MODELS WERE YOU RELYING ON HER FOR
SO ARE YOU SUDDENLY GONNA BE
WELL WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS IS YOUR START TIME GONNA BE DELAYED 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MODELS READY IF SHE DOESN'T COME THROUGH
UH-HUH
YEAH
WELL
UM CAN YOU DRAFT CRAIG IN TO BUILD SOME IF NECESSARY
YEAH
WELL YOU KNOW ME CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND ALL THIS
I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT THE WORST
YOU CAN UM CALL A JAST TELCON BETWEEN YOU AND MARLOES
YOU KNOW I IF IT'S NOT THAT SEE YOU KNOW
WITH THE COLD CALLING YOU CAN USUALLY AT LEAST FIND OUT WHETHER THEY'RE ALIVE AND GET AN AN OFFER TO TO GET SOMETHING
BUT YOU KNOW THE NEXT THE NEXT ESCALATION IS SAYING NO WE REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW TUESDAY AT SUCH SUCH A TIME UNLESS YOU
UM
BUT PRESUMABLY WHATEVER IT IS THEY'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH IS NOW OVER
MM-HMM
YEAH
I D
I'D JUST HATE FOR THAT TO C UM TO SLOW YOU UP IN COLLECTING STUFF THAT'S ALL
OBVIOUS YEAH UH OKAY THAT'S TRUE
WELL THAT SOUNDS
THAT'S QUITE A SMALL THING SHE CAN DO FOR YOU I GUESS
YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW W SITTING THERE BRAIN DEADLY CONSTRUCTING YOU KNOW SOME MODELS THAT SHE NEEDS TO DO
IT'S JUST TO PROVIDE ADVICE ABOUT THIS WHICH MUST TAKE TAKE LESS TIME
WELL THAT ALL SOUNDS FINE
YOU GUYS WORRIED ABOUT IT
YOU WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING
WE'VE MOSTLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT SCHEDULE
SO
MM
YOU'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF THINGS TO UM F DO THAT WE HAVEN'T SET YOU UP FOR ANY TIME SOON
THE G. D. F. SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT TAKE A WEE WHILE
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING FROM ME FOR THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S ALREADY SORTA SPECED
I MEAN AGAIN THAT'S THE PAIR OF YOU
YEAH
IT'S JUST WHAT I'M WORRYING IT W WORRIED ABOUT IS HIM BEING IN THE LAB ALL DAY LONG AND YOU NOT BEING SURE LIKE WHAT TO DO FOR THE ANALYSIS ON OR SOMETHING
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE COMPLETELY UNAVAILABLE WHEN YOU'RE RECORDING
OR WILL THERE BE TIMES WHEN YOU DON'T RECORD ALL DAY
UH-HUH
YEAH
'CAUSE HE MIGHT OH YEAH NO NO NO I UNDERSTAND THAT
IT WAS IT WAS MORE LIKE OH IT WAS MORE LIKE YOU KNOW
YOU SO THIS WEEK HE'S GOT YOU KNOW THE G. D. F. STUFF TO DO
THEN NEXT WEEK YOU'RE PLANNING ON RECORDING
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF SUDDENLY YOU'RE UNAVAILABLE ALL OF NEXT WEEK JUST WHEN HE RUNS OUT OF WORK
YEAH
SO SO WE'LL WORRY ABOUT IT THEN
MM-HMM YEAH
YEAH
WHAT I DO DON'T KNOW IS WE WANNA BOTHER WITH A PART BUILDER
I MEAN THE IDEA WAS IT WASN'T WORTH THE INVESTMENT RIGHT
YEAH YEAH YEAH
OR DO Y
M YEAH BUT NOW NOW THAT THE GUY BUILDING THESE MODELS KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO DO THE ROTSYM SOME STUFF
DO THEY HAVE DO YOU HAVE TROUBLE DOING IT
NO SO
YEAH
WELL G I MEAN UM WE MIGHT WANT TO UM SEVERELY CASH LIMIT THE INVESTMENT THAT YOU PUT INTO MAKING A PART BUILDER RIGHT
SO HOW HOW MANY PERSON DAYS WOULD IT BE WORTH LIKE IF CRAIG DISCOVERED IT COULD BE DONE IN X. DAYS
RIGHT SO THERE'S YOUR LIMIT
DON'T SPEND MORE THAN A DAY OR TWO ON IT
YEAH UH 'CAUSE IT REALLY ISN'T WORTH IT
YOU YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S THINGS ABOUT THIS PROJECT WE'VE HIDDEN FROM YOU SO FAR THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT
SO IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE OUT OF WORK
OH REALLY
OH THAT ONE'LL JUST BE A LITTLE ADD ON
THAT'LL WHATEVER IT IS IT'LL BE THE SAME SKILLS AS YOU'VE LEARNED FOR SOMETHING ELSE
UM AND IT'LL JUST BE I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT'S YOU 'CAUSE I THINK SOMEBODY ELSE IS DOING THAT ACTUALLY
BUT UM I'M THINKING MORE OF THE FACT THAT UM AT SOME POINT WE SHOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU ABOUT THIS N. X. T. STUFF
SO
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S X. M. L. AND X. M. L. AND YOU KNOW
IT TAKES STAND OFF LINKS AND STUFF AND IT'S UM SOME SOME PEOPLE IF THEY'RE NOT USED TO LINGUISTIC ANNOTATION C UM UH IT C TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO GET THEIR HEAD AROUND THE WAY THE DO DATA DATA MODEL WORKS
AND UM YOU KNOW THERE'S STUFF TO LEARN THERE
SO
YEAH YEAH
YEP
SO
YEAH
SO JUST DON'T WITTER AWAY YOU KNOW WEEKS ON FRIPPERIES WHEN WE'VE GOT THE REAL ME MEAT OF THIS YET TO COME
WE'LL FIND WE'LL FIND PLENTY OF REALLY REALLY CRUCIAL S THINGS FOR YOU TO DO
SO
OKAY
SO UH I'LL UH REMIND MYSELF TO LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT BEFORE THE NEXT TIME WE GET TOGETHER
YEAH
SO YOU COLLECT ON MONDAY
THAT MEANS YOU DON'T WANNA MEET RIGHT
OH R RIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY NEXT WEEK
IT'S ACTUALLY THE WEEK THAT YOU WERE PLANNING ON
OH OKAY
WELL I DON'T KNOW
ANYWAY UM YOU'LL TELL ME WHETHER IT WE CANCEL THIS
OR WHETHER I JUST TALK TO CRAIG
IN WHICH CASE WE WON'T BE UP HERE 'CAUSE WE DON'T RECORD TWOS
OH YEAH
THAT SHOULD BE FUN
LET'S SEE THAT'S LIKE THE
THAT COMES AT AN IDEAL TIME FOR YOU THEN
THAT'S LIKE THE TWENTIETH OR SOMETHING
UH I CAN'T ADD
MONDAY IS THE
YEAH
OH YEAH YOU HAVE TO PROMISE TO TELL US HOW THAT IS
'CAUSE PEOPLE DO ASK ME
YEAH ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN
YEAH
YEAH YOU'D BE SURPRI THESE THINGS DO
WELL IF THEY WERE GONNA DO THAT THEN THEY'D FORCE YOU TO GO TO IT
I WOULD AND I WOULD KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'D GONE TO KNOW
YOU KNOW
I'M PRETTY SURE THEY DIDN'T HAVE INDUCTION IN MY DAY
SO
REALLY
BUT YOU ONLY STARTED HERE
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO I'M SURE
OH WELL
OH YEAH
UH
YEP
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
SEEMS REASONABLE
SO UM IT'LL BE LIKE IN UH MONITOR
BUT YEAH THEY'LL ALL BE DIFFERENT TIERS LIKE THAT
AND THEN THERE'S THE LANGUAGE STUFF AS WELL PRESUMABLY
YEAH THIS IS THE EASY STUFF
YEAH
WELL EYES AND MOUSE
EYES AND MICE
UH-HUH
AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR YOU RIGHT
I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE WAY YOU WANT IT
COURSE THERE ARE LOT LOTS OF THINGS THAT CAN DO THAT
BUT IT'S THE LANGUAGE PART THAT'S THE HARD PART
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S
THAT SEEMS FINE YEAH
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE UM THE SETS OF CODES ARE
WELL THE WHATEV WHATEVER WHATEVER YOU'RE GETTING OUT OF THE JAST ANALYSER
SO
I MEAN BLINKS AS WELL RIGHT
OH SO YOU DON'T WANT A PA UH PART OF THIS DATA
AYE
BUT
I THINK YOU I THINK YOU SHOULD WELL THERE'S TWO VIEWS ON THIS
UM IF YOU DO THEN THE PEOPLE FORMULATING RESEARCH QUESTIONS WILL ASK ABOUT THEM
BUT IF YOU DON'T THEY'LL PROBABLY ASK ABOUT THEM ANYWAY AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO ADD 'EM AFTER THE FACT
UH SO IT'S PROBABLY EASIER JUST TO S SHOVE 'EM IN
YOU CAN STICK 'EM IN A DIFFERENT UM TRACK AND UH AND THEN LOAD 'EM OR NOT LOAD 'EM AS YOU PLEASE
'CAUSE IT'S NOT WELL I DON'T KNOW
WITH IS IT IS IT PART OF SO TH THESE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE SETS OF CODES AGAINST TIME RIGHT
ISN'T BLINK A PART OF THIS
YEAH
BUT BUT ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT
BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE BLINKING BASICALLY IT'S LIKE AN A NIL CODE
YOU C CAN'T FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING OTHERWISE
SO IT MAY ACTUALLY BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE BLINKS REGISTERED IN THERE BECAUSE YOU MAY DISCOVER YOU NEED TO TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT TO SMOOTH SOME KIND OF ANALYSIS THAT YOU'RE DOING
SO IT COULD BE THAT IF THEY ONLY THEY HADN'T HAD A BLINK JUST THEN THEY WOULD'VE BEEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M THINKING MORE
THAT YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT
OH I HOPE N NOT TO MUCH RELIES ON MISSING STUFF 'CAUSE PEOPLE BLINK
I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE UM YOU KNOW
THE PERSON LOOKS A P A PART AND THEY'VE GOT A UH FIXATION BEFORE AND AFTER AND THERE'S BLINK IN THE MIDDLE
AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE TIMES WHEN YOU WANNA TREAT THAT AS ONE THING RIGHT
OH RIGHT
OKAY
SO BUT IN THAT CASE
RIGHT UH-HUH
IN THAT CASE THEN UM THESE TIERS ARE ALREADY LIKE BLINK CORRECTED
AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BLINKS AS PART OF THIS
YOU'D WANT BLINKS AS A SEPARATE TIER IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IT IN
YEAH
YEAH SO THE KEY THING IS HE HERE IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE
AND UM THE SECOND KEY THING IS UM IT BETTER BE REALLY CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THESE CODES UM UH W YEAH
WHETHER ANY MONKEY BUSINESS HAS BEEN DONE AROUND THE BLINKS TO CORRECT FOR THAT
UM 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE OBVIOUS LOOKING AT THAT SET OF CODES THAT
UH YEAH I SUPPOSE IF YOU KNOW ABOUT EYE TRACKERS THEN YOU'LL JUST KNOW
BUT
IT I THINK YOU'RE JUST SAYING IT COMES OUT OF THE EYE TRACKER ALREADY RIGHT
THEY'RE ALREADY BLINK CORRECTED
YEAH
YEAH
BUT WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IS LIKE AT WHAT STAGE IN THE EYE TRACKING STUFF WHERE IT DOES THAT AND WHETHER THAT GETS THROUGH SO THAT UM CRAIG GETS IT AUTOMATICALLY IN WHAT HE'S TRANSLATING OR TO G. D. F.
WHETHER HE NEEDS TO REDO THE SAME ANALYSIS BECAUSE SOMETHING ABOUT THE DATA PATH CUTS OFF THAT ANALYSIS FOR THE EYE TRACKER
OR WHETHER WE EVEN LIKE IT RIGHT AND WANNA DO IT SOME DIFFERENT WAY
YEAH
BUT IT COULD BE THESE THINGS ARE CORRECTED FOR BLINKS IN THIS WAY PLUS THERE'S BLINK INFORMATION
SO YOU KNOW IT IT TREATS IT AS A FIXATION AROUND BLINKS AND IT ALSO JUST HAPPENS TO TELL YOU WHERE THE BLINKS ARE
'CAUSE AS THEY WERE SAYING THEY LIKE TO USE BLINK RATE AS MEASURES OF COGNITIVE DIFFICULTY OR SOMETHING
SO
IF THEY'RE NOT STILL FIXATING ON IT WHEN THEY COME BACK OUT OF THE BLINK THEN
WHY IS THAT IS THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO ANALYTICALLY
OH RIGHT
YEAH YOU SAID THAT
WELL BUT DOES UM THE DURATION OF FIXATIONS COUNT FOR ANYTHING
'CAUSE IT IF YOU'RE JUST ADDING THE LENGTH OF THE BLINK TO THE FIXATION YOU'RE NOT TREATING IT AS A SACCADE
OKAY
WAIT
OKAY
I KINDA GET THIS
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
SO MORE COMPLICATED THAN I THOUGHT
I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE MULTIPLE FIXATIONS ON AN OBJECT
YEAH
OKAY
WELL IT'S NOT OKAY I MEAN THIS IS KINDA WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THIS CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE G. D. F.
I MEAN YOU MIGHT SEE IT AS THE INITIAL G. D. F. IS JUST WHATEVER STRAIGHT FORWARDLY TRANSLATES WITHOUT
YOU KNOW WITHOUT TRANSFORMS WITH JUST THE DATA FORMAT CHANGING FROM THE ASCII
AND THEN THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT GET ADDED THAT YOU MIGHT STILL WANT TO BE IN UM AUGMENTED G. D. F. FORMAT
YOU KNOW LIKE THIS BLINK AND THE GAZE AND WHATEVER ELSE
AND THEN YOU TRANSLATE TO N. X. T.
SO YOU MIGHT STILL WANNA HAVE EVERYTHING IN THIS ONE G. D. F. FILE FORMAT THAT REPRESENTS EVERYTHING
AND THEN THE N. X. T. THING IS JUST A SPLITTER
IT'S NOT DOING ANY FANCY ANALYSIS
SO I SEE THIS AS YOU KNOW
A BUNCH OF LITTLE ROUTINES THAT TAKE THE THE G. D. F. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION IN IT AND ADD NEW INFORMATION INTO TH SUB SCRIPT VERSIONS OF THE G. D. F. FILE THAT CONTAINS THESE POST PROCESS ANALYSES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN IT TO SOME EXTENT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH DATA FORMAT IT'S IN N. X. T. OR G. D. F.
BUT IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR THE CONVERTER BETWEEN G. D. F. AND N. X. T. NOT TO ADD ANY DATA
ALL IT DOES IS DO THIS THIS STUPID DATA FORMAT CONVERSION
AND IT IT'S JUST YOU KNOW SEPARATING IT OUT IN THE LITTLE STEPS
SO YOU KNOW THERE HAVE TO BE THESE OTHER SCRIPTS THAT ADD ANY UM DATA TRANSFORMS UM NOT DATA FORMAT TRANSFORM FORMS BUT DATA TRANSFORMS
LIKE THIS IDEA OF UM OF PUTTING TOGETHER GAZES FROM FIXATIONS
SO Y YOU KNOW I IF WE KEEP IT SIMPLER LIKE THAT SO THAT IT'S IN LITTLE PIECES
THEN IT'LL BE JUST EASIER TO UNDERSTAND W WHAT THE WH THE WHOLE THING DOES
'CAUSE YOU YOU C YOU KNOW I IF SUDDENLY YOU DISCOVER THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE G. D. F. TO N. X. T. TRANSFORM
YOU WANNA KNOW WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THESE LITTLE POST PROCESSES GOING WRONG OR WHETHER IT'S JUST THE THING THAT DUMPS IT INTO THE MULTIPLE FILES FOR THE AND G. D. F. TO N. X. T. TRANSFORM IS C IS PRETTY SIMPLE
SO UM YOU KNOW
OH YEAH
SO THAT'S LIKE ALL THE ANALYSIS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO THINGS
ARE YOU JUST GONNA COPY WHAT THEY DO
OR IS IT DOCUMENTED LIKE WHY THEY DID IT THEY WAY THEY DID IT
OR IS IT JUST
WELL IT'S GOOD STARTING POINT RIGHT
SO IT'D BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF YOU AGREE WITH THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE ABOUT HOW TO DO THINGS
MM
AH
WELL B BUT WE DON'T WANNA BUILD IT INTO OUR DATA PATH
WE JUST WANNA LEARN FROM IT I THINK RIGHT
CORRECT
OR NO
YEAH
I'M JUST THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE I SO THIS TAKES THE ASCII TO TO A D SIMPLIFIED ASCII
AND SIMPLIFIED IN WITH TRANSFORMS IN IT ASCII AND IT'S JUST IT SEEMS TO BE HARDER TO MAINTAIN SOMETHING THAT'S GOT THAT IN IT IF IT'D BE BETTER TO BREAK THINGS UP INTO LIKE STEPS
THAT YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE THE AND ALS WELL WHY DO I THINK THIS
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROGRAMME AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA GIVE US THE NEXT VERSION AND THAT'S GONNA BREAK OUR ENTIRE PIPELINE
YOU KNOW
THAT'S THE MAIN REASON
YEAH
UH YEAH I CAN IMAGINE I CAN IMAGINE THAT ALSO REQUIRING SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER WHAT THEY DO IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANNA DO
THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
UH
UH-HUH
WELL SOUNDS GOOD
YEAH
AND IF IN DOUBT UM DON'T FILTER STUFF OUT KEEP IT IN RIGHT
'CAUSE WE ALWAYS DUMP IT TO THIS OTHER N. X. T. TRACK THAT WE DON'T NEED TO LOAD NECESSARILY
SO UM THE IDEA IS YOU JUST KEEP STUFF UNLESS
MM-HMM
OH YEAH AND IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO DUMP STUFF INTO AN INTO SEPARATE TRACK
W WE GOTTA TEACH YOU ABOUT THIS AT SOME POINT THOUGH
SO UM BUT STILL NOT QUITE SURE WHEN
IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE IN ANOTHER WEEK
SO JONATHAN MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO UM TELL YOU ABOUT IT WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVED 'CAUSE YOU WERE GONNA GET OVERLOAD ABOUT LEARNING EYE TRACKERS AND NO
IT'S JUST TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE AND IT WASN'T IMPORTANT THAT IT BE THEN
YEAH
SO
YEAH
HE'S A COOL CUSTOMER
HE'S READY FOR IT
OKAY
I THINK WE'RE DONE RIGHT
SORRY
OH YEAH I DON'T KNOW
I DO NOT REALLY NEED TO THIS JUST SAYS LOOK AT THE WIKI
FIND OUT WHAT'S NEXT
YOU COULD GIVE GIVE CRAIG MORE WORK TO DO
THIS ONE'S MINE
IT
OH YEAH WELL THAT'LL TAKE FOREVER
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY FUN
CHECK YOUR BATTERIES
YEAH IT SAYS
IS IT SLIDING PAST
YES
STILL FIFTY SIX PERCENT COMPLETED
SKIP IT
'CAUSE I'M JUST DOING A B YEAH DISK CHECK OR SOMETHING
YEP
IS EVERYTHING GOING SMOOTH
HMM
MM
AS LONG AS IT COMES OUT IN THE END
THAT'S
MM
UH NOPE DON'T THINK SO
UM
MM-HMM
UH IT'S BATTERIES WE'RE WAITING FOR
THE THEY'RE THEY'RE DUE UH I I WAS TOLD THE BEGINNING OF THIS WEEK
UM TH THEY ARE QUITE STRANGE
MM UH UH IT'S W UH R UM A AVRIL HAS ORDERED THEM FROM SOMEWHERE POSSIBLY
N NO
THEY'RE PROBABLY ONE FIFTY EACH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH WELL HOPEFULLY
THE THEY SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE LAST WEEK
BUT UH CAROLINE THEN PHONED UP TO CHASE THEM AND THEY THEY WERE S THEY WERE TOLD TO BE HERE
SHOULD BE TODAY
UH R B WELL WE CAN STILL TEST WHETHER CAMTASIA RUNS ANYWAY
IT'S JUST THE UH WHETHER IT'S THE MICROPHONES ARE PICKING UP THINGS CORRECTLY THAT WE NEED TO CHECK
NOT YET NO
RIGHT
MM RIGHT O
VIRTUAL
YEP
UH RIGHT
BUT WHAT WE'RE
I I
MM-HMM
IT NO IT'S TWO BATTERIES WE NEED
UH NO NO
NO
YES
FAIR FAIR ENOUGH IF YOU WANT
MM-HMM
IT'S STILL PROBABLY EVEN THAT ANGLE
CAN'T REMEMBER THE WIKI
D UM
THE ONLY THING THAT WELL THE THING THAT'S HOLDING S ME SLIGHTLY UP IS UM CHECKING WHETHER JOE'S F FINISHED THAT THERE I THERE IS A WORKING UM MODEL BUILDER
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE FINISHED FINISHED VERSION YET
AND THE THE NINTH
YEAH HE STILL HAD N HOURS LEFT
I WASN'T SURE UH IF IT WAS DOWN TO THE NUMBER OF HOURS OR WHETHER THIRTY FIRST OF OCTOBER F UH CERTAINLY UH UH HE RIGHT
I THINK HE'S HAD SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN
BUT UH N I'VE N NI NIJMEGEN HAS GONE DEAD FOR ALL THOSE LAST TWO WEEKS
WELL UH IT W E E ELLEN'S AWAY
N NO UM BUT I THINK WHAT THEY HAD WAS SOME BIG REVIEW
UH A AND SO I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING BACK FROM THEM
SO UH THE MODELS FOR
YES UH-HUH
WELL NO
WELL WE DON'T NEED TO UM MAKE THE THE PARTS ARE ALL THE STANDARD TANGRAM ONES I HAD BEFORE ANYWAY
THE X. FIG THING'S ONLY WHEN WE COME TO BUILDING AIRPLANES AND NEW PECULIAR SHAPES
UH BUT FOR THIS EXPERIMENT IT'S JUST THE TANGRAM TYPE UH TASK
UM YEAH IF YOU GOT RIGHT
HOW R F HOW RECENTLY THAT NOTHING I HAVEN'T I HEARD ANYTHING FROM JOE FOR A A WEEK OR SO ANYWAY
SO
YEAH
THAT'S THAT'S NEWER THAN THE
IT'S THE LAST THING WAS IN SP RESPONSE TO THE THING I WAS SAYING LAST WEEK ABOUT THE PARALLELOGRAM BEING THE WRONG WAY AROUND AND UH W FROM THE MODEL BUILDER TO THE ACTUAL YEAH
UM THAT NOTHING HAS I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING SINCE FROM EITHER SORT OF THE NETHERLANDS OR FROM YOU
YEP
OH IS HE BACK
OH IS HE
OH NO RIGHT OKAY
YEAH IT WAS AFTER IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT UH THERE WAS THE THING ABOUT UM W W WHY THE PARALLELOGRAM WAS THE WAS A MIRROR IMAGE
MM-HMM
YES
YES OR AT L LEAST UM SHE WAS MEANT TO HAVE HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY
'CAUSE THEY D THEY D HAVE ACTUALLY RUN THINGS AND TO UH GET AN IDEA OF THE SORT OF STYLE AND TO CHECK THAT THEY'D BE ALRIGHT
BUT ALL VERY QUIET
YEAH
UH NO IT HAS JUST BEEN EMAIL RATHER THAN UH F F THE TELEPHONE TYPE OF UH REQUEST
BUT
I'M DOWN FOR A WEEK
WHAT'S THE SEVENTH IS A W A WEEK TODAY I THINK
NEXT WEEK
UM WELL UH I HAVEN'T BOOKED ANYBODY IN OR ANYTHING
BUT UH THAT'S WHEN I'M HOPING
WE HAVE BEEN OF COURSE PUT BACK A BIT BY THE EYE TRACKER GOING DOWN
BUT UH WE'RE WE'RE NEEDING WE'RE CERTAINLY NEEDING SOME DATA IN THE BAG BY THE FIRST OF DECEMBER I THINK
NO
UM HOPEFULLY NOT
THE ONLY OTHER SLIGHT COMPLICATION IS UM WHICH WILL BE B I THINK BROUGHT UP AT THE MEETING ON THURSDAY FOR ALL THE EYE TRACKING USERS
UM UH THE LAB HAS BEEN BLOCK BOOKED AGAIN
JULES FROM UM PSYCHOLOGY
HAVE DI
YEP
LECTURER
WELL PRESUMABLY NOT
BUT UH IT'S SORT OF QUITE SOLIDLY BOOKED UH FOR F CERTAINLY W WHAT SIX DAYS FROM TEN TILL FIVE FOR TWO OR THREE OF THOSE DAYS
UM I WOULDN'T I NO I CAN PROBABLY AT LEAST EMAIL HER AND ASK HER UH IF SHE'S REALLY NEEDING IT ALL THAT TIME
I I WELL YEAH AT THE M YEP
WHEN PEOPLE JUST UH IF THEY CAN LOG ON TO IT CAN BOOK IT
MM-HMM
UH I TH IN THEORY JAST IS MEANT TO HAVE IT EVERY MORNING
UM BUT IT UH THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS OR OR ANYTHING
NO
UH NO
THAT AS LONG AS P OTHER PEOPLE DON'T FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW DISCONNECT SOME BITS OF THE EQUIPMENT THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD
IT'S JUST THE
UH YES IT'S UM IT'S ON THE P UH IT'S NOT ON THE BOOKING SYSTEM
IT'S ON A WEB PAGE THAT FRANK CREATED ABOUT THE LAB
WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS IS THERE
MM-HMM
YEP
SHOULD SHOULD BE
I'VE ALSO GOT TO GET CAMTASIA WE WELL YES THE M THE MODEL BUILDER
I'VE GOT TO GET CAMTASIA WORKING UM AS A SORT OF LITTLE MULTI MEDIA THING TO GENERATE A VIDEO OF HOW TO MI SORT OF A AN INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO
IT'S WHAT I'LL HAVE TO DO THIS WEEK
HMM
U
YEP YEAH
UH I'LL I'LL DO THAT
YEAH AND JUST YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
HAVE A LOOK AT UH UM HOPEF HOPEFULLY THERE'S NOT A P A PROBLEM
BUT UH THEY SAID MARLOES WAS UH ALSO MEANT TO BE CHECKING IT AND DOING THINGS AND QUIET
UM I'VE I UH IT HASN'T BEEN DIVIDED UP IN THAT SORT OF WAY
BUT
UM DEPENDS HOW QUICKLY I MANAGE TO GET A GRIP OF IT HOW LONG IT TAKES ME TO GENERATE THEM OR HOW I GET ON WITH THE CAMTASIA
MM-HMM
UN UNSURE OF YET
IT IT SHOULDN'T THE THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY GREAT UH PROBLEMS
JUST CHECKING THAT THE THEY'RE OF A SUITABLE LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY OR OR OF WHATEVER
YEAH
YEAH
NO QUITE QUITE RIGHT
YEAH
SO YEAH
UM YEAH
WELL I WAS HOPING FOR SOME FEEDBACK FROM YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
YES
YEP MM BOOK A TIME AND I THINK SO
RIGHT
WELL I'LL TRY AND GET AHOLD OF HER AGAIN TODAY AND SEE WHAT
I THINK IT IT WAS UP TILL THE END OF OCTOBER
SO PRESUMABLY TODAY THEY'RE NOW FREE AGAIN
OR TAKING A WEEK OFF TO RECOVER
YES
UM WELL HOPEFULLY IT IT WON'T ANYWAY
IT'S JUST IF I THEN DO IT I HOPEFULLY WILL GET THE RIGHT MODELS
THAT'S THAT'S THE PRO SO UH UH IT WILL BE GENERATED
IT'S WHETHER THE MODELS ARE OPTIMAL OR NOT THAT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL SO IT WAS THE WHOLE ALL THE DYNAMIC REGION PART OF IT THAT'S UH
MM-HMM
UH N UM NO
UH WELL IT DEPENDS HOW HOW MANY I CAN BOOK IN AND GET GET RUNNING
YEAH
AND BEFORE MY BRAIN MELTS IT BUT W WHEN WHEN THE EXPERIMENT'S RUNNING YEAH IT'S I'LL BE IN THE LAB
UH I CAN'T JUST GO IN LET THEM GET START AND THEN COME BACK
IT'S UH SO SOME PEOPLE CAN BUT
UH TH THEY'LL CERTAINLY BE TIME BECAUSE I'M RIGHT NEXT TO THE LAB ANYWAY I'LL COME BACK JUST TO CHECK MY EMAIL AND THINGS ANYWAY SO UH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH I WOULDN'T BOTHER MORE THAN ONE OR TWO CERTAINLY
MM-HMM
W
MM-HMM
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE TWIDDLING YOUR THUMBS NO
UM WELL AT TWELVE O'CLOCK NEXT MONDAY THE LAB IS TECHNICALLY BOOKED BY JULES
IT
UH IT STARTS THE UH ON WE THIS WEDNESDAY AND GOES THROUGH TO NEXT WEDNESDAY
MM-HMM
UM WHAT ELSE
UH YEAH
MY THEN OTHER COMPLICATION IS TWO WEEKS TOMORROW I START MY TEACHING
MM-HMM
FOR I'VE GOT TWO WEEKS OF THAT FO FOUR LECTURES AND FOUR LABS
YES
UH WHAT'S TOMORROW IS THE F TOMORROW THE F FIRST
SO IT WILL BE THE FIFTEENTH FOR TWO WEEKS
OH YOU'VE GOT YOUR UH INDUCTION THAT'S RIGHT
UH YES
FROM A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME TO YOU KNOW
MM-HMM
IT'S PROBABLY THE UNIVERSITY'LL COVER ITSELF LEGALLY I THINK BY DOING THIS
UH MM-HMM
UH NO I SUPPOSE RATHER THAN BEING NOBODY'S BOTHERED SO FAR IS IT
UH WELL I DON'T REMEMBER BEING ASKED FOR AN INDUCTION
SO
IN APRIL
I GOT INVITED TO A UM A A A SUMMER GARDEN PARTY FOR NEW STAFF MEMBERS
BUT THAT WAS BUT THAT'S ALL
HMM
UH UH
I HAVE ONE N. X. T. QUESTION WHICH HOPEFULLY WON'T BE WELL IT'S NOT ONE
JUST HOPEFULLY AS PART OF THE OUTPUT IT WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IS THAT CORRECT
SO YOU'VE GOT THE GAZE POSITION OF THE FIRST PERSON GAZE POSITION OF THE SECOND MOUSE POSITION OF THE FIRST
MOUSE POSITION OF THE SECOND AND I DON'T KNOW A COMMON MOUSE ACTION THERE OR SOMETHING
DOES THAT T JUST IN IN SORT OF LAYERS LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEP
YES UH-HUH
M THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE THE EYE MOVEMENT UH OTHER SORT OF STUFF YEAH
IT HO HOPEFU UH HOPEFULLY THAT'S YEAH I GUESS IT'S THAT'S WHY I DRE
AS WELL
YEAH MM-HMM
YEAH
SO I WAS JUST YEAH
I WAS JUST CHECKING THAT UH I KNOW THE LANGUAGE PART BECAUSE THEY SAY L. P. HERE BUT UH THIS WOULD BE THE THE THE NEW PART
NEW STUFF
UH YEAH WHATEVER THAT IS
UM YES I'M NOT SURE WHETHER WE NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE JUST HOW MANY THERE ARE IN EACH TRA UM UH P I DON'T KNOW
I SUPPOSE IT COULD GO IN
UH I MEAN I SUPPOSE IT WE'RE AS WELL TO HAVE IT IF WE CAN
RIGHT
WELL UH JUST SAY STICK 'EM IN ANYWAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM BLINK WOULD UH UH AT THE MOMENT JUST GET LUMPED IN WITH THE SORT OF PREVIOUS GAZE
MM-HMM
THE WAY THEY'RE LOOKING MM-HMM
MM-HMM
M UH YES MM-HMM
MOVING SOMEWHERE ELSE OR IS MORE LIKELY TO BE UH
BLINKING AT THE SAME TIME AS THE OTHER PERSON WAS DOING SOMETHING I THINK TO MM-HMM
YEAH
YES
NORMAN NORMALLY UH WOULD BE JUST AS I SAY LIKE ADD THE BLINK TIME AND DURATION TO THE PREVIOUS FIXATION
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT ABSORBING ANY NEW INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHAT THE CRITICAL SORT OF DECIDING FACTOR IS
YES SO THAT THEY'LL INCLUDE THE
SO I I YEAH WOULD HA IT WOULD BE AS A SEPARATE TIER WHERE JUST TO MARK
THE ACTUAL POSITION
MM-HMM
WHAT'S INCLUDED AND WHAT'S N YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
NO NOT CERTAINLY L NOT LOOKING AT CODES NO
MM-HMM
KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND WHAT NOT TO YEAH
UH I THERE ARE WELL THEY'RE ALREADY IDENTIFIED AS BLINKS
THEN IT'S UH I IT IS AT TH HMM AT WHAT STAGE
THE SOFTWARE THAT I'VE USED UH P POOLS UH THE BLINKS SO WILL ADD IT ON
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DEFAULT
YES
YEAH SO I'M NOT SU I CERTAINLY IT'S LISTED AS A SEPARATE EVENT IN THE STREAM
BLINKS ARE A TAG UH FROM THE E. D. F. AND AND THAT SORT OF THING
IT'S REGISTERED AS A A DETECTION
BUT
MM
MM-HMM
UH I Y YEAH
UH I MEAN IT IT IT WON'T BECAUSE OF THE FIXATION IT WILL BE DOWN TO WHAT WE DEFINE AS UH A GAZE
SO BASICALLY THE TIME FROM WHEN SOMEBODY STARTS LOOKING AT AN OBJECT UNTIL THEY LEAVE IT
AND SO IF THEY BLINKED A LOT WITHIN THAT THEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT THAT OBJECT
SO IT'S JUST THE TIME IN TO THE TIME OUT
MM-HMM
YEP
MM-HMM
HMM
SOME OTHER WAY
YES
MM-HMM
YEP THERE'S A BLINK SORT OF EVENT
MM-HMM
YEP
IT SHOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF TREATING A B ADDING ON THE BLINK TO THE LAST FIXATION OR SOMETHING ANYWAY
UH WELL UH THE THE REAL REASON IS UM AS LONG AS THEY'VE BEEN BLINKING
EVEN IF THEY THEN OPEN THEIR EYES SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT'S WHEN THEY START ABSORBING THE NEW INFORMATION
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE A JUST A LONG SACCADE
MM IT YOU KIND OF HAVE VISUAL SUPPRESSION WHEN YOU MOVE AND IT'S THE SAME WHEN YOU'RE BLINKING
YOU'RE NOT TAKING ANYTHING IN
SO
UH IT IT'S YEAH THAT YES UM THAT'S FOR THE SORT OF GAZE TIME MEASURE
UH IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE FIXATIONS ARE STILL UM INDEPENDENT
SO THE THEY W FIXATION DURATION ISN'T DOESN'T INCLUDE THE BLINK IN THE ASCII A OUTPUT
IT'S ONLY WHEN WE START LOOKING AT SORT OF THE TOTAL GAZE THAT UM THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT LOOKING AT ONE PARTICULAR OBJECT
WHICH INCLUDES ALL THESE SORT OF MULTIPLE FIXATIONS AND ANY BLINKS AND THAT SORT OF THING
IS IT IT'S A A SORT OF COMPOSITE UH VIEWING TIME
UH YEAH I'M AFRAID UH MM-HMM
YEP YEP
ALTHOUGH WE'LL ALSO STILL NEED A COUNT OF THE FIXATIONS JUST SO WE CAN HAVE YOU YOU'VE GOT MEASURE FIXATION DURATION AGAIN JUST TO S SEE IF THOSE THEY SPEND LONGER JUST F AMOUNT OF MORE STABLE MOVE UH EYE FIXATION OR NOT
UH
MM-HMM
YEP
TO YE YEAH MM-HMM
VIEWING TIMES
MM-HMM
RIGHT YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL THAT'S PARTLY WHY I BROUGHT THIS UP NOW IS IT I'M NOT SURE WHAT POINT DOWN THE DATA PATH THINGS SORT OF HAPPEN
BUT THAT'S WHAT I WANT OUT IN THE END
UM WELL THE N. X. T. STUFF WILL HAVE THE MORE COMPLETE PICTURE 'CAUSE IT WILL INCLUDE COMBINE ALL THE LINGUISTIC STUFF WITH ALL THE MOVEMENTS AND THE ACTIONS
UM BUT THERE'LL BE I SUPPOSE JUST SOME PURELY EYE MOVEMENT STUFF WE COULD DO
I S PRESUMABLY WITH G. D. F.
UH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
HMM
C
AN
AND UH YEAH
THAT'S ALSO WHY I SENT YOU THE MM SAARBRUECKEN SOFTWARE F THAT UH THE STUFF THAT TAKES THE ASCII SORT OF FORMAT ORIGINALLY AND THEN JUST UH SORT OF COMPRESSES IT AND THINGS
YEAH THE GERMAN STUFF
UH BECAUSE THAT LITTLE UTILITY UM DOES THINGS LIKE T WELL BUT YOU CAN TELL IT TO WHAT TO DO WITH BLINKS
WHETHER JUST TO LUMP THEM IN OR OR NOT
UH WHAT THE MINIMUM FIXATION DURATION FOR A STABLE FIXATION WOULD BE SORT OF YOU HAVE IF IT PICKS UP T FIXATIONS LESS THAN SAY FIFTY MILLISECONDS
YOU CAN TELL IT JUST TO AGAIN LUMP THEM ALL TOGETHER THAT'S NOT A SORT OF RELIABLE ENOUGH FIXATION
UH YOU CAN PUT IN THESE SORT OF OF THINGS
SO THAT'S UH THAT'S A BIT OF SOFTWARE THAT'S SENT AND THAT INCLUDES THE SOURCE CODE AND THINGS AS WELL
MM-HMM
UH NO THERE'S VERY LITTLE DOCUMENTATION AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE FOR THESE SORT OF THINGS
YEAH SO I G I UH YEAH
THAT'S THAT'S WHY
SO MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
FINE
GOOD
MM-HMM
'CAUSE UH AL ALSO JUST FILTERS IT
THERE ARE A LOT OF UM STRANGE EVENT TAGS THAT THE EYE LINK PRODUCES THAT ARE FAIRLY MEANINGLESS I THINK
AND IT CAN STRI IT STRIPS OUT A LOT OF THE JUNK UH AS WELL
SO IT CLEANS IT UP
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
RIGHT
UH B FINE
WELL UM POSSIBLY
YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH
THE PR
UH YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN UH-HUH
MM-HMM
SIX OR
MM-HMM
IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE S IT SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUITE GRABBABLE 'CAUSE IT IS IT'S WRITTEN IN JAVA
YEAH WELL YES UH-HUH THE ACTUAL UH
MM-HMM
YEAH
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER THAN MAKING TOO MUCH COMPRESSION TO START WITH AND THEN BEING OUT OF UNABLE TO GO BACK OR YEAH
LOSSINESS
OR OR YOU LEAVE VERY QUICKLY
UH-HUH
YEP
WELL I'M I AM
OH DEAR
UH MY PAGE IS BLANK STILL
I GUESS NOT
YEAH
SO THIS WAS THAT FACE TO FACE MEETING
UM BUT IT UH IT DOESN'T
THERE ISN'T TH SO THERE ARE THINGS IN THE EYE TRACKER RECORD THAT WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT IN THE G. D. F. FORMAT UM LIKE THE FRAME RATE EYE MOVEMENT
YOU KNOW WE WE UH UH I WE'RE IF WE'RE EXPECTING THE G. D. F. FORMAT TO BE UM SORT OF A PARSED VERSION OF EVENTS
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH RAW FRAME F FRAME RATE STUFF COMING OUT OF THIS
YOU WOULDN'T PROB YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT IN THIS KIND OF FORMAT FOR UP TRANSLATION TO THE OTHER THINGS
YEAH WE YEAH YOU CAN GET BACK TO IT
YEAH
WE'RE NOT THROWING ANYTHING AWAY
THIS IS JUST THE STUFF
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THE TH BUT THE WAY TO THINK OF THIS IS THIS IS THE DATA THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ANALYSE AGAINST THE OTHER TRACKS OF DATA
SO THE DATA THAT WE WANNA COMPARE WITH A LANGUAGE OR WITH WHATEVER
AND UM SO
YEAH
S SO IN ESSENCE WHAT YOU WOULD THEN DO IS
WELL WE'RE NOT DOING FRAME RATE AT ANY FRAME FOR WELL MAYBE WE ARE
I DON'T KNOW
I I HAD THOUGHT WE WERE YEAH THE EYE TRACKER DOES
BUT
BUT RIGHT
W WHAT W UM THE KINDS OF EVENTS THAT WE HAD R UH BEFORE TALKED ABOUT PUTTING INTO THE RECORD FOR THEN USE IN ELAN AND N. X. T. ISN'T BASED ON SAYING EVERY X. SECONDS SOMETHING
YOU KNOW GIVE ME GIVE ME WHAT'S HAPPENING EVERY X. SECONDS
IT'S MORE LIKE YOU KNOW GIVE ME THE FIXATIONS AND THE UM THE BLINKS
YEAH
OH YEAH
DURATIONS ARE IN THERE
BUT IT'S NOT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UM SAYING THAT SOMETHING IS IN A PARTICULAR STATE EVERY FRAME
WHATEVER THE FRAME RATE IS YOU KNOW TEN SECONDS A MINUTE
YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S ONE KIND OF W WAY OF LOOKING AT DATA
AND UM A PARSED VERSION OF THE DATA WHICH ISN'T AT UM ANY PARTICULAR LENGTH
IT RELIES ON THIS REALLY CLOSE FRAME RATE THAT'S UNDERNEATH
NO NO
THE TIME THE TIME IS STILL IN THERE
BUT YOU'LL GET UH WHAT YOU WANT IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE UM THE CONCEPTS BEHIND THAT DATA THAT YOU WANT REPRESENTED
SO RATHER THAN SAYING THE EYE WAS AT THIS PARTICULAR PLACE
YOU KNOW HERE AND THEN A TENTH OF A SECOND LATER HERE AND THEN A TENTH OF A SECOND LATER HERE
YOU SAY THERE WAS A FIXATION FROM THIS TIME TO THAT TIME AND THERE WAS BLINK FROM THIS TIME TO THAT TIME
AND
OKAY
MM-HMM
RIGHT
SO THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE
WE'RE NOT THROWING ANYTHING AWAY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT TOOL WOULD YOU USE TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE DATA
WOULD YOU BE SO THE MORE YOU CAN PLAN
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME IT WAS ON DURING THAT FIXATION
YEAH
OKAY SO THE PERCENTAGE IS I I IS A CUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE USING FOR MEASUREMENT
IT'S A CUT OFF FOR WHETHER OR NOT IT COUNTS AS A FIXATION
IS THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
YEAH
'CAUSE ALL YOU WANNA KNOW IS WHETHER THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE SAME OBJECT IN THE PERIOD AFTER
YEAH
OKAY
CAN WE DRAW IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT UM THAT THIS IS SATISFYING ELLEN'S CONCERNS
WELL THERE'S A WHITE BOARD RIGHT
WE LOVE THIS THING
SEE IF THE PENS WORK
SO UM THIS IS UM A. 'S EYES RIGHT
AND B. 'S EYES
AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DRAW THIS RIGHT IS THAT THEY YOU KNOW
IF UM FROM THIS TIME TO THIS TIME THEY'RE LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE
W WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW IN THE CRITICAL YOU WANNA KNOW AFTER THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PERIOD WITH THIS GUY
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
SO
YEAH
SO YOU KNOW HE MIGHT GET TRIANGLE ONE THERE AND NO MAYBE THIS ONE'S GONNA OVERLOOK LAP QUITE A BIT
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS BE ABLE TO DEFINE UM BIGGER PERIODS WHICH IS THE PERIOD WHEN THEY'RE SORT OF INTERESTED IN TRIANGLE ONE OVERALL RIGHT
THIS IS SORT OF SOME META LEVEL ANALYSIS
YEAH
BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE N. X. T. QUERY LANGUAGE BUT IT YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN ANY YOU KNOW
THIS IS SUCH SPECIAL PURPOSE S BUT IT'S EASY ENOUGH GIVEN THE DATA FORMAT FOR ANY OF THESE THINGS TO DO THAT
SO YOU COULD DO IT ON 'CAUSE I IT'S JUST A MATTER OF I THE HARD PART IS DECIDING HOW CLOSE TOGETHER THESE HAVE TO BE BEFORE YOU DECIDE THAT THIS IS A EVENT THAT YOU WANNA PULL OUT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW ALGORITHMICALLY YOU'RE YOU'RE ALREADY PUTTING TOGETHER I MEAN THIS IS ESSENTIALLY ALREADY YOU KNOW THESE FIXATIONS WITH STUFF IN BETWEEN
AND UH UM YOU KNOW WE WE'VE GOT AN ALGORITHM FOR DECIDING WHEN THAT'S A LOOK I GUESS
YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT OR NO
OH YEAH YEAH
SO IT'S ALL FIXATIONS
THEY'RE THESE ARE ALL FIXATIONS AND SACCADES BUT WITHIN THE YEP
SO THAT'S EASY ENOUGH
SO THE HARD THING IS THEY COULD BE MOVING THEIR EYE ARBITRARILY HERE RIGHT
AND YOU KNOW MAYBE EVEN HAVING FIXATIONS ON OTHER THINGS
YEAH
YEP
BACK AND FORWARD
YEP
SO UM THIS ISN'T YEAH
BUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS WE WE CAN ALREADY BUILD INTO THIS G. D. F. FORMAT THESE REGIONS IF YOU CAN GIVE A DEFINITION OF WHAT YOU THINK THAT IS
BUT I THINK THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS IS TO BE ABLE TO INSPECT THE DATA IN UM SOME TOOL AND PLAY AROUND WITH THE DEFINITIONS
BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND UH ELAN'S A REASONABLE CHOICE FOR THAT RIGHT
WHAT YOU NEED IS SOMETHING WELL NO BECAUSE YOU NEED TO
Y YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS
SO I G I GUESS THIS IS A CASE OF CRAIG WRITING SOME SCRIPTS SO ROBIN HAVING SOME IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS AND SAYING
YOU KNOW ADD THIS DATA A AUTOMATICALLY
IT I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT HARD RIGHT
IT'S JUST THERE'LL BE A BUNCH OF THESE
YOU'LL HAVE SOME RULES ABOUT HOW MAYBE HOW LONG YOU SPEND ON OTHER OBJECTS AND W WHETHER THE OTHER OBJECT IS UM THE EXISTING CONSTRUCTION OR NOT RIGHT
AND SO UM
AH RIGHT
SO IF THEY IF THEY UH THEY HAD A FIXATION ON C. YOU WOULDN'T BE WORRIED
BUT IF THEY HAD A FIXATION ON
YEAH THEY'RE YEP
BUT YEAH THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE CLOCK UM AND THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT THEY MAY LOOK AT COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT THAT'S LIKE A SEPARATE ANALYSIS RIGHT
SO
IT NO NO
THE SO EVERY SEPARATE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT WHAT WE FIND E WHAT WE CAN GET OUT OF THE DATA EASILY AT THE MOMENT IS AT THIS KIND OF LEVEL RIGHT
AND THEN IT'S A CASE OF DEFINING ALGORITHMICALLY ALL THESE OTHER TRANSFORMATIONS THAT YOU WANT
SO THIS IS ONE UH WE HADN'T THOUGHT OF ADDING BEFORE BUT WE SHOULD RIGHT
WHICH IS UM WELL HOW WOULD YOU DECIDE WHETHER SOMETHING WAS THE CURRENT ADDENDUM UH THE CU
SO THAT'S A HUMAN DECISION
YEAH
UM
BUT THE EX
BUT WE BELIEVE
BUT WE BELIEVE J. P. TO BE DEFINING THAT MAYBE
YEAH
MM-HMM
I COULD BELIEVE THEM YEAH NO TAKING AN INTEREST IN THAT
I MEAN THE GENERAL DIVISION WAS LANGUAGE HERE AND OTHER STUFF THERE RIGHT
I'LL JUST I'LL JUST MINUTE THAT
OH YEAH EYE TRACKER HERE
YEAH I MEAN WE KNOW THAT
WELL YEAH
BUT I MEAN WITH TRANSACTION CODING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU WOULD USE I Y YOU WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT VERBAL ANALYSIS EXACTLY
IT'D BE VERBAL PLUS ACTION
BECAUSE IT'S A TASK BREAKDOWN
IT'S JUST A SEGMENTATION
YEAH BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE YOU YOU WOULDN'T DO TWO CODINGS FOR TASK LEVEL ONE YOU WOULDN'T DO TRANSACTION CODING IN A ACTION SEGMENTATION
I I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALISTIC BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'D ACTUALLY DO IS USE UM THE FULL RECORD OF WHAT YOU HAVE AND DO A SEGMENTATION
I THINK IT'D BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IF YOU USED LIKE JUST THE LANGUAGE WITHOUT WATCHING THE VIDEO TO DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE BREAKING DOWN THE TASK
OH YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE CODING TH UH BASED ON THAT THOUGH AND THEN THAT SEEMS A STRANGE WAY TO GO ABOUT THINGS
I MEAN THIS THE LANGUAGE EVENTS ARE MULTI MODAL RIGHT
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER
WHA WHY DO YOU CARE WHETHER THEY CAN DO IT JUST BASED ON THE THE LANGUAGE
IS
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME MUCH LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER THINGS ONE COULD GET OUT OF THIS DATA
BUT I YOU KNOW I IT'S A POSSIBILITY
WE'LL
YEAH
WELL I C I CAN SEE MAYBE WANTING TO KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN DO THE CHUNKING JUST BASED ON THE ACTIONS WITHOUT THE LANGUAGE IN CASES WHERE THEY USE BOTH
IT'S MORE G I CAN'T QUITE SEE WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO IT JUST BASED ON THE LANGUAGE WHEN W YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAD BOTH
UH-HUH
WELL I THINK THAT ONE'S JUST BOUND TO FAIL
BUT YEAH
REALLY
OKAY
ANYWAY
SO BACK BACK TO THIS MAIN PROBLEM WHICH IS YEAH
W THE RECORD THAT WE ARE GETTING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IS ABOUT THE M ABOUT THESE YOU KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT SOME REGION OF THE SCREEN DEFINED DYNAMICALLY
AND THEN WE NEED SOME WAY OF KNOWING WHAT THE YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE ADDING THESE OTHER ANALYSES ABOUT YOU KNOW
THEY'RE THEY'RE JOINTLY FOCUSED ON THIS REGION AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT S PERCENTAGE OF TIME THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT AS ADDING NEW TIERS OF INFORMATION TO EITHER THE ELAN TRACK OR N. X. T.
THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH SORT OF TRACK BASED IN THIS WAY
UM BUT THE HARD PART IS KNOWING HOW YOU WANNA DO THAT
AND I I THINK IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO THE G. D. F. FORMAT IS JUST THIS
AND THEN WE'VE GOT NO OPTION BUT TO UH FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS JUST EXPLORE THIS DATA
SUGGEST WAYS ABOUT DOING IT AND UM BE ABLE TO PLAY THEM BACK AND SEE UM WHEN WE THINK WE'VE GOT THESE THINGS RIGHT
I DON'T THINK WE EVEN KNOW WHAT THE SET OF THESE THINGS ARE THAT WE WANT MUCH LESS HOW TO GET 'EM YET
SO TH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
SO THIS IS NOT THE YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE AIMING FOR
BUT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS WHAT CRAIG PROGRAMS FOR THE INITIAL G. D. F. TRANSLATION
UM
YEAH
SO LET'S JUST RETURN TO THIS QUESTION OF FRAME RATE
BECAUSE THIS IS THE THING WE WERE NOT PLANNING TO UM TRANSFER INTO THIS FORMAT
SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT A FRAME RATE KIND KIND OF CODING IS AG IT CAN AGAIN BE SEEN AS A TRACK
BUT IT SAYS IT'S A CODING LIKE THIS RIGHT WHERE YOU SAY IT'S IN STATE A. STATE B. STATE C. STATE A.
RIGHT
SO YOU RIGHT
SO I'M JUST YOU'RE HAPPY THAT IT'S NOT GONNA HAVE FRAME RATE UH LIKE THIS
IT'S GONNA HAVE AN INTERPRETATION LIKE THIS
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
SORRY
RIGHT
W RIGHT
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ELLEN'S CONCERNS MIGHT MEAN WE NEED TO ADD MORE INFORMATION TO THESE TAGS BECAUSE UM
YOU KNOW THIS THING IN ITSELF IS TH BUNCH OF FIXATIONS RIGHT WITH SACCADES
FIXATIONS AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME THOSE FIXATIONS COVER YOU MIGHT WANT
OKAY
SO NUMBER OF FIXATIONS
PERCENTAGE OF
NO NO
THIS IS THIS IS STILL UM UH SUMMARY DATA
THEY'RE HE'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST ADDING ATTRIBUTES TO THESE THINGS THAT SAY THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THAT COUNTED AS THAT LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE RIGHT
SO Y IT'S POSSIBLE
YEAH THE SPOTS'LL BE DIFFERENT ANYWAY
'CAUSE I YOU'RE NOT GONNA G HAVE THE SAME PIXEL
SO UM WE HAVE THE OPTION THAT WE CAN PUT IN AN A. FIXATION THING HERE RIGHT AS WELL
IF YOU WANT THE SMALLER IF YOU WANT THE SMALLER CODING IN IN HERE
SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST PARSED INTO THIS IDEA OF WHICH OBJECT
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE RAW FIXATION UM DATA
WE CAN PUT THAT IN AS ANOTHER TRACK
IF YOU THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT IN ONE OF THESE TOOLS THAT SHOWS YOU THE TRACKS AGAINST EACH OTHER
YEAH I D THAT'S ALL HE ASKED FOR
YEAH
WELL I THINK
YEAH AND IN N. X. T. THERE'S NO COST RIGHT BECAUSE THE Y THE UH YOU JUST DON'T CHOOSE TO LOAD THOSE
ALL WE'RE DOING IS DUMPING IT AS OUTPUT THAT YOU CAN LOAD IF YOU CHOOSE TO
UM I G S YOU KNOW SO IF THEY'RE THINGS THAT YOU JUST KNOW ARE CRAZY AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT THEN WE DON'T DO IT
BUT OTHERWISE WE GO AHEAD AND DUMP 'EM
'CAUSE IT'S EASY TO DUMP OUT THE FIXATIONS
UM YEAH
OKAY
SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THE DID YOU WANT THE YOU
M NOT E WELL IF IT'S EACH YOU HAVE TO D YOU HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO ANOTHER TIER RIGHT
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN SAY THERE WERE THREE FIXATIONS AND THEY AVERAGED UH A CERTAIN TIME
BUT YOU DON'T WANNA
D WELL WHAT ABOUT THE THE OVERALL SUM OF THE DURATIONS
IS THAT I MEAN WHICH WAY DO YOU WANT TO
YEAH THEN THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT
THAT WAY AROUND
OKAY
AND UH Y DID YOU WANT THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME FIXATED AS OPPOSED TO WHICH IS SORT OF ANOTHER VIEW OF THIS NUMBER
YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY OF THESE AS
YEAH
WELL IT'S NOT UM THE THE EXTRA COST OF HAVING THESE AS ATTRIBUTES IS NOT HIGH
SO UM YOU KNOW
IT SAVES YOU I UH HAVING TO DO WRITE SCRIPTS TO DO ARITHMETIC ON THAT LATER IF YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT ARE GONNA BE USEFUL TO YOU
MM-HMM
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
WELL WELL BUT Y THOSE ARE DIFFERENT TRACKS OF INFORMATION
SO WHAT YOU WANT IS ONE TRACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH OBJECT IT'S ONE ONE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ON THE OTHER GUY'S GAZE
AND ONE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S ON UM ONE OF THE MOUSE POSITIONS
YEAH BUT I IN IN THE ANALYSIS YOU SHOULD TREAT THOSE AS COMPLETELY SEPARATE TRACKS OF INFORMATION
BECAUSE THEY CAN BE LOOKING AT THEY COULD LOOK SIM SIMULTANEOUSLY AT SOMEBODY'S MOUSE SOMEBODY'S GAZE AND SOME OBJECT RIGHT
SO
YEAH
SO THE THESE ARE INDEPENDENT
SO SO WHAT WE WANT IS WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT S AT THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE RIGHT
AND SAY THEY ARE IN THIS PERIOD WELL I MEAN UH THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GIVEN WHAT I'VE TRYING TO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO G SO THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF TRACKS HERE RIGHT
BECAUSE WELL WE JUST ADDED THIS FIXATION TRACK
AND THEN THERE IS A. 'S MOUSE NOT THEIR EYES IS ON AN OBJECT RIGHT
AND THE MOUSE MIGHT BE ON TRIANGLE ONE
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
I MEAN I THE MOUSE WE'RE JUST SAYING WHERE IS THE MOUSE
YOU KNOW IT'S ON THIS OBJECT
AND THEN UM A. 'S EYE IS ON WELL A. 'S MOUSE I GUESS RIGHT
A. 'S EYE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT A. 'S MOUSE HERE
A. 'S EYE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT B. 'S MOUSE HERE RIGHT
I MEAN THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING CROSS PRODUCTS AT THE THINGS THAT COULD BE CO LOCATED
SO YOU JUST TREAT 'EM AS INDEPENDENT
AND I'M GUESSING FROM WHAT YOU SAY YEAH
I GUESSING FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT ALL THESE TRACKS
YEAH WHICH IS FINE
THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH THAT AT ALL
YEAH
S SO UM UH YOU KINDA GOT THE IDEA HERE
YEAH
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU DON'T TREAT THAT ENTIRE SET AS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE
IT'S JUST SO THA THE OBJECTS IS LIKE A SEPARATE LEVEL OF ANALYSIS
IF WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE OBJECTS THAN WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE GAZE
'CAUSE THEY CAN HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME
DOES THAT HAPPEN
OH RIGHT
UH-HUH
OKAY
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS LIKE A NEW PROBLEM FOR US WHICH IS I'M GONNA CHANGE
THAT'S THE BAD ONE
YEAH
SO YOU'RE SAYING
OKAY
CAN YOU WRITE ON MY PEN PAD
JUST SAY YEAH PENS
WHITE BOARD PENS
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE LOOKING AT UM UH SQUARE ONE AT THIS POINT
'CAUSE THEY
CLOSE TOGETHER
OKAY THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE DATA MODELS AND EITHER OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE USING
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GREATEST OVERLAP
DRAW UH MY G MY UH SPACIAL REASONING IS NO GOOD
SEE UH I I'M THE ONE THAT USES THE WHITE BOARD
'CAUSE I ACTUALLY PUT THE THE MICROPHONES ON
UH THIS IS THE BETTER PEN
UH-HUH
YEAH
BUT YOU HAD A WAY OF CHOOSING WHICH ONE RIGHT
SO YOU JUST MEAN WHICH I IS IT CLOSER TO THE IS THE CIRCLE I MEAN WHAT IS THIS CIRCLE
THEY'RE LOOKING AT A PIXEL OR SOMETHING RIGHT
RIGHT
S RIGHT
OH SO THOSE VARY IN SIZE
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
THEY COULD BE
OH BUT WHAT PAIN THAT'S GONNA BE ANALYTICALLY
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA HOW MANY PARTS ARE THERE
LIKE
OKAY
I KNOW WAYS OF GETTING AROUND THIS ANALYTICALLY
'CAUSE YOU C
IF THEY'RE REALLY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER IT'S GONNA GET FOXED
YEAH
IT'S NOT THE DATA FORMAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT
IT'S THE UM THE WAY YOU DO THE ANALYSIS
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE TO SAY UM YOU KNOW DID THEY JOINTLY LOOK AT TRIANGLE ONE
OKAY
DID THEY JOINTLY LOOK AT SQUARE ONE
OKAY
DID THEY JOINTLY LOOK AT YOU KNOW YOU NEED SOME WAY OF UH UH GOING OVER THE WHOLE THING
BUT I C WE CAN FIND WAYS AROUND THAT
I THINK FOR NOW WE WE DO IT THIS WAY AND THEN WE WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED OUT OF IT IN THE END
IT'S JUST YOU KNOW IN ELAN IT THAT HAS THE SIDE EFFECT THAT IF YOU GO FOR THE NATURALISTIC WAY OF OF UP TRANSLATING TO ELAN
THERE'LL BE A ZILLION TRACKS
AND IT'LL PROBABLY RUIN THEIR VIEWER
'CAUSE YOU'LL GET VERY SPARSE DATA ON EACH TRACK
IT'LL BE LIKE THE OLD REFERRING EXPRESSION GENERALIS UH UH VISUALIZATION UM THE MAP TASK
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT ONE OBJECT ONE LANDMARK AND THEN ANOTHER LANDMARK
WELL IT'S BIG RIGHT
WELL WE'LL SEE IF ELAN LIKES IT OR NOT
YEAH AND WE B WE BETTER ALSO LIKE HAVE IN THE REPRESENTATIONAL LIST OF PAR LIKE EVEN IN THE N. X. T. UP TRANSLATION A LIST OF PARTS
IT IT AFFECTS THE WAY WE DO THE N. X. T. U UP TRANSLATION AND MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR PEOPLE
WELL THE
AND IT SUDDENLY BECOMES AND THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE CONSTRUCT AT A TIME RIGHT
IT'S THERE IS NO THE CONSTRUCT RIGHT
WHAT WHY DOES IT WHY DOES CONSTRUCT ONE BECOME CONSTRUCT TWO WHEN YOU ADD SOMETHING TO IT
YEAH
OH AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IT TO STAY TRIANGLE ONE WHEN YOU START WITH A CONSTRUCT IT'S NOT A CONSTRUCT AT ALL
IT'S JUST A ONE THING
AND WE DON'T WANT TRIANGLE ONE TO SUDDENLY HAVE BIGGER STUFF
YEAH YEAH THERE ARE
THERE ARE
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT WAS THE NEXT QUESTION I HAD
YEAH
OH YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'LL COVER MOST OF 'EM
MM-HMM
I YEAH
IT'S TRIANGLE TWO
YOU DON'T BECAUSE THAT'S YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE HUMAN CODING TO DO THAT
YEAH THERE MIGHT BE MULTIPLE TRIANGLES THAT YOU'VE BROKE AND YOU WON'T KNOW WHICH ONE THEY'RE PLANNING ON USING IT FOR
WELL YOU KNOW WHICH MOLD THEY COME FROM
AND SO YOU KNOW WHICH SHAPE THEY MATCH
BUT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW WHICH ONE OF THE ONES THEY'RE MEANT TO REPLACE
OH SO THERE'S NO TWO PARTS WITH THE SAME SHAPE
THEN
OH SAME SHAPE AND COLOUR
RIGHT OKAY
OH OKAY
SO YOU CAN TELL WHAT IT'S MEANT TO REPLACE THEN
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME IT'S UH JUST A CASE OF THE MOLD RIGHT
YEP
YEAH
BUT THE THIS ALSO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
WE IN WHEN YOU SPECIFY THESE THINGS DO YOU SPECIFY THE MOLDS OR DOES IT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE MOLDS ARE BASED ON
SO IS THIS HARD WIRED INTO TIM'S PROGRAM
OR IS IT JUST AN ARTIFACT OF THE WAY WE S
RIGHT
OKAY
SO IT'S HARD WIRED
SO MINOR MODIFICATION NEEDED FOR
MM-HMM
UH BUT WHAT WERE THE REQ WHA
HAS MULTIPLES YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH UH BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE UNIQUE
MM-HMM
SO WHAT
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO I TH
I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW TO TRY TO SUMMARISE
UH WE WE THINK TIM'S PROGRAM CAN DO BOTH OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT YOU WANT
BUT I'M STILL WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE UH EFFECTS ARE FOR ANALYSIS
BECAUSE YOU WERE AIMING AT SOMETHING IN UM THE G. D. F. FORMAT AND I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT
AND W
YEAH
SO SO OKAY
SO I'LL SUMMARISE WHAT WE SAID ABOUT THAT PART THAT UM EVERY TIME YOU CAST OFF A NEW PART FROM A MOLD OR
YOU KNOW EVERY BLACK TRIANGLE HAS A DIFFERENT I. D.
AND YOU KNOW IT'S A BLACK TRIANGLE 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHICH MOLD IT CAME FROM
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH PART IT WAS INTENDED TO REPLACE ON THE SCREEN BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MIND READ
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DEFINE
MM-HMM
MM
I THINK THAT THIS IS A HUMAN CODING THAT IS PART OF THE ACTION CODING
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW ANYBODY BUT A PERSON WATCHING THIS CAN GUESS WHY THEY CAST OFF THIS THING AT THIS TIME
YEAH BUT THAT'S OKAY 'CAUSE THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT UNDERLYING PART NUMBERS
AND WHEN YOU SAY WHAT A CONSTRUCT
NO
NO NO
YES
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO WE CAN EASILY LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THAT AUTOMATICALLY
IT'S JUST THE WHY THEY G WHY THEY GET NEW PARTS THAT'S THE PROBLEM FOR US
WE CAN'T IF THEY SUDDENLY IF THEY DECIDE TO GET A PART OF A MOLD WE DON'T KNOW WE CAN'T KNOW WHY UNTIL THEY DO SOMETHING WITH IT
IF THEY DO
OH YEAH YOU SAID THAT
UM
YEAH BUT YOU CAN
BUT YOU CAN BREAK YOU YOU CAN BUT YOU CAN BREAK ONE WHEN YOU BREAK ONE YOU DON'T CAST OFF THE MOLD YOURSELF IT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY
OH OKAY NEVER MIND THEN
SO THEY JUST HAVE TO USE IT YEAH
UH-HUH
OH BUT THEY HAVE TO DRAG IT UP PAST THE MOLD LINE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH WHERE THERE'S EXTRA PARTS
YEAH
OKAY
SO THIS WHY QUESTION DOESN'T EVEN ARISE BECAUSE
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WITH IT
WHEN THEY DECIDE TO MOVE IT PAST THE MOLD LINE THEY'RE P DOING SOMETHING WITH IT PROBABLY AND YOU'LL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WITH IT BECAUSE
THEY DO IT
YEAH
HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT
YEAH BUT THERE'S THERE'D BE NO WAY OF CODING THAT AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO THAT
BUT THAT'S A HUMAN CODING RIGHT
MM-HMM
SO W
SO UH THAT'S GONNA PARTICULARLY BE A PROBLEM FOR J. P. RIGHT
REMEMBER M ALL THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE F WITH LANGUAGE WITH AND WITHOUT LANGUAGE
AND IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL WHETHER THEY BROKE SOMETHING INTENTIONALLY WITHOUT THE LANGUAGE
WHICH MEANS IT'S PROBABLY NOT
YEAH OKAY
BUT TH UM THIS IS PROPERLY PART OF THE ACTION CODING
SO WE SHOULD WELL WE SHOULD MAKE A WISH LIST RIGHT AS A SIDE EFFECT
MM
THEY COULD DISCUSS DECIDING TO BREAK SOMETHING AND AND THEN ONE GUY DOES IT
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
NO NO
IT WAS THEM JUST DR UH FORGETTING TO UM DEFINE AN ATTRIBUTE THEY HAD TO
WELL WHI WHICH IS PROBABLY A DOCUMENTATION FAULT RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
IS THERE A Y YEAH
WELL WHILE WE'RE ON PAST THINGS IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANNA TELL US ABOUT THE PRIOR PART OF THIS
WHICH IS THE YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS HE HOLDING YOU UP FROM
UH-HUH
RIGHT
SO IT DOESN'T SLOW DOWN THE EYE TRACKER
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING NASTY
SO WE WE P SO WE PAY FOR IT AND
NOTHING IMPORTANT AND NOTH NOTHING BIG ENOUGH THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT IT RIGHT
YEP
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I KNOW
OH DO YOU NEED TWO COPIES OF CAMTASIA TO DO THAT
SO YOU'RE GONNA LOOK INTO THIS RIGHT
WELL Y C LOOK AT THE LICENCE CONDITIONS IT MIGHT NOT
I C I NEVER PRE JUDGE LICENCES UNTIL I'VE READ 'EM
SO UH WELL AND UM HOLD ON BEFORE WE GET GO ANY FURTHER
SO THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR DATA STORAGE RIGHT
BECAUSE W UM IT MEANS WE'VE GOT WELL NO THIS IS THREE TIMES RIGHT 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT OH NO
WE'RE GONNA BUILD WE'RE GONNA USE JAVASCRIPT TO BUILD THE VIDEOS ON THE FLY RIGHT 'CAUSE IT'S FAST
SO THE THE PERMANENT STORAGE IS JUST THE CAMTASIA STUFF
SO UH IS THAT A PROBLEM
WHERE ARE WE PUTTING THINGS
OH WE CAN WE CAN PUT 'EM IN THE SAME THING RIGHT
YOU CAN DUMP 'EM INTO ONE VIDEO FRAME IF YOU DON'T MIND LOSING RESOLUTION
BUT THAT'S MAYBE A PROBLEM RIGHT BECAUSE
SO THE SYNCHRONIZATION'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM
YEAH BEFORE THE TASK
NO
SO
THESE ARE BA THESE ARE BACK UPS
RIGHT
SO THE FLASH GET ALLOWS YOU TO HAND SYNCHRONIZE THEM LATER IF YOU NEED TO BY STRIPPING EXTRA VIDEO OFF THE FRONT
AS LONG AS YOU MAKE SURE YOU START 'EM BEFORE THE FLASH THEN YOU'RE FINE
BUT IT WILL THERE'S A A COST OF HAVING TO GO TO BACK UP WHICH IS SYNCHRONIZING THEM
OH OKAY
SO YOU SO YOU SHOULD START THE CAMTASIA REALLY EARLY THEN
RIGHT
OKAY
UH-HUH
THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING IT
I MEAN U
WELL OKAY YOU'VE GOT THE PROPER SOUND RECORD
BUT YOU'RE NOT DUMPING IT THROUGH CAMTASIA TO RECORD IT RIGHT
YOU'RE
WHAT BEFORE WE WERE GONNA USE CAMTASIA AT ALL WHAT WELL WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO WHAT WERE WE GOING TO DO WITH THE SOUND
UH-HUH
SO UH HA WOU IS THERE ANY SOUND DEGRADATION THAT COMES ABOUT FROM PUTTING THIS THROUGH CAMTASIA RATHER THAN RUNNING IT OUT STRAIGHT
OKAY
SO WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING ON DOING IT IS BUNGING IT ON ONE OF THE CAMTASIA TRACKS AND THEN SPLICING IT OFF THE CAMTASIA TRACK
IT'S AN EASY BIT OF YEAH
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA BUNG IT ON THE OTHER CAMTASIA TRACK TOO IF YOU NEED IT RIGHT
BUT WE'LL JUST WE'RE GONNA STORE ALL THREE SEPARATELY THEN
AND THE SOUND IS GOING TO START AT THE SAME TIME AS ONE OF THAT ARBITRARY ONE OF THE CAMTASIA VIDEOS
BUT YOU'LL KNOW WHEN THE REAL EXPERIMENT YOU'LL KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT AND THE EYE TRACKER TIMINGS
YEAH
NO HUMAN INTERVENTION REQUIRED
IT'S TIME STAMPED
YEAH
BUT HO HOLD ON
DO WE NEED THAT
I MEAN IT I I THOUGHT THE WAY THAT TIM HAD THIS SET UP ORIGINALLY
UM THE AUDIO UH W THE TIME STAMPS USED THERE WOULD BE JOINT TIME STAMPS BETWEEN THE AUDIO AND THE EYE TRACKER SO THAT YOU KNOW
UH THE AUDIO RECORD TEN SECONDS IN WAS THE SAME AS TEN SECONDS INTO THE EYE TRACKER RECORD SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY EXTRA HAND WORK
YOU KNOW ANY UH CHOPPING THE STARTS OF AUDIO SIGNALS TO GET THERE WAS NOTHING OKAY
SO WE'RE RELYING ON YOUR MATLAB SCRIPT TO GET US THE CHOPPED VERSION OF THE AUDIO RIGHT
RIGHT SO WE CAN EITHER ADJUST THE EYE TRAI TRACK DATA OR WE CAN ACTUALLY CHOP THE AUDIO SIGNAL TO TAKE OFF THE FIRST WHATEVER HOWEVER MANY SECONDS
YEAH
BUT UH BUT D UM THE UH LINING UP THE CAMTASIA TWO IS GONNA TAKE WE W HE'S WORKING ON A MATLAB SCRIPT FOR THE SOUND BUT NOT FOR SO THE ONE THAT'S GOT THE SOUND ON IT
THAT'LL ALSO TELL YOU WHERE TO CHOP THE VIDEO TO GET IT TO LINE UP
THE ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE SOUND ON IT IT WON'T
OH
SO IT'S JUST GOT THE BLEEPS
OH OKAY SO W NO HAND SYNCHRONIZATION REQUIRED AT ALL
UM AS LONG AS THE SCRIPTS WORK RIGHT
'KAY
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU ABOUT THE FINDING THESE THINGS
SO WE JUST HAVE TO W HOPE WE DON'T HAVE AN ANY SUBJECTS WITH THE ODD VOCALIZATIONS
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
'CAUSE THIS THIS IS THE DROP OUT TEST
YEP
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
MM
OH YEAH
I KNOW BUT SO YOU G YOU GOT A SOLUTION FOR THAT THEN
OH RIGHT OKAY
YEAH
YOU'RE SURE THERE'S NOT A BETTER SOLUTION THAT INVOLVES
'CAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE MIGHT WANNA USE THIS FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION OR SOMETHING
YOU NEVER KNOW IF IT'S THE DATA IS THERE THEN
YOU KNOW
YEAH
AND YOU'RE GONNA WANT FORCED ALIGNMENT
OH NO
WELL NO NO
BETTER TO COLLECT AND SORT
UH WELL IT'S THE MONO
WAIT WAIT W I I THOUGHT THE SOL THAT A BETTER SOLUTION WAS FIXING THIS PROBLEM WITH THE MONO MICROPHONE SOCKET
SOUND CARD
SO YOU SAID THE PROBLEM WAS THE M IT THE M M I IS EXPECTING A MONO MICROPHONE INPUT
SO IS THAT FIXABLE
LIKE IS THERE ANY WAY YEAH
UH I THINK A NEW SOUND CARD SOUNDS A BETTER SOLUTION THAN MONKEYING ABOUT WITH TRYING TO FILTER WHITE NOISE OUT
WHICH ISN'T HARD
BUT HI BUT IT'S ONLY GOT ONE INPUT RIGHT
I BELIEVE IT'S EASY TO PUT TWO MONOS INTO A STEREO SIGNAL
YEAH
SO
YEAH YEAH
SO IS THERE ANY REASON WHY WE WOU DON'T DO THAT
YEAH
WELL
IT'S IN THE OLD DAYS WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WANT A LITTLE IF THEY'D BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM WE WOULD HAVE HAD A LITTLE STEREO THING IN THE BACKGROUND AS BACKUP AS WELL JUST TO MAKE SURE
'CAUSE IT'S SLIGHTLY DICIER YOU KNOW IF HIS SCRIPTS DON'T WORK THEN YOU DON'T GET THE OVERLAP
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A REAL TRIAL
IT JUST HAS TO BE TWO GUYS TALKING IN THE TWO BITS
AND THEN
WE'VE BOTH BEEN SO BADLY BITTEN IN THE PAST
YEAH
BUT THIS THIS SOUNDS REASONABLE TO ME
I SO I THINK
YEAH
DO DO THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME SOUND CARD PROBLEM
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT
OKAY
OH
WELL UH YEAH
I THINK TELL THE GUYS
TO YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S JUST THE WAY THEY WIRED IT
SO UM IT'S GETTING LATE AND I'VE GOT A TWO O'CLOCK AND I'VE GOT A NICE LUNCH
SO I WANNA EAT MY LUNCH TODAY
UH WHAT DID YOU WANNA GET THROUGH TODAY MORE
I MEAN I THINK I THINK IT WAS USEFUL GOING THROUGH YOUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THIS
'CAUSE UM THAT'S QUITE A BIT CLEARER IN MY HEAD AT LEAST AND BUT I THINK MOSTLY WE LEAVE YOU TO GO AWAY AND RE DESIGN THE G. D. F. OR ADD NEW BITS TO THE G. D. F. ALONG THESE LINES
AND THEN W
YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT I THINK THE THING TO DO IS UM FOR YOU TO GO AWAY AND THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY WITH THE DIFFERENT TRACKS FOR THE DIFFERENT OBJECTS AND THE UM THE KINDS OF THINGS WE'VE ADDED ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE AND WHAT HAVE YOU
AND AND TRY TO CHANGE THE SPEC SO IT IT REFLECTS THIS AND MAYBE UM OH MAYBE BY THAT POINT THERE WILL BE SOME SAMPLE DATA OR SOMETHING UH AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS FOR US TO LOOK AT THE SP THE SPEC THE WAY YOU UNDERSTAND IT NOW AND SOME DATA
AND THEN ELLEN'LL HAVE NEW IDEAS ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED OR ABOUT THESE POST ANALYSES YOU KNOW THE AND THEN AND WE CAN ADD 'EM IN
BUT IT'S GONNA EMERGE OVER TIME
I MEAN THAT'S CLEAR
OH SO THE SPEC TO THE OTHER CONVERSATION YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S SOLVED NOW
YEAH TEST
WE HAVE TO TEST
WELL YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR MODELS OR DO YOU
YEAH
YEAH
WELL UH ANYTHING YOU ACTUALLY NEED FIXED
YOU KNOW
JOE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE RIGHT
SO
WELL I BUT HE WASN'T GONNA BE BOOKING ANY TIME TO US AFTER THE THIRTY FIRST OF OCTOBER
SO UM
THAT THAT MEANS THAT ANY BUGS THAT NEED FIXED ARE NOW CRAIG'S RESPONSIBILITY RIGHT
YOU DON'T KNOW HAVE ANY CHANGE ON THAT RIGHT
'CAUSE HE THAT'S WHAT HE SAID TO US ORIGINALLY
SO I WOULD ASSUME YOU KNOW NO MORE CONTACT WITH JOE
IT'S NOT FAIR TO GET WORK OUT OF SOMEBODY FOR FREE
SO YOU KNOW ASK CRAIG INSTEAD
YEAH
I DON'T THINK
WELL W HE WASN'T PAID IN ADVANCE
HE'S BEING PAID IN ARREARS
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
UH I THINK IT'S
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE ALL THE SOFTWARE
I MEAN IT'S NOT BIG THINGS IT'S JUST MAINTENANCE AT THIS PROGRAM AT THIS POINT AND
YEAH
I IF HE CAN GIVE IT YOU KNOW LIKE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS YOU GOTTA HAVE AN IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU DISCOVER A BUG IN THAT
AND WE CAN MAKE CRAIG SHIFT ALL HIS OTHER PRIORITIES TO DO THIS 'CAUSE WE BOUGHT HIM
RIGHT
YEAH
SO IT'S A KINDER WAY
IT YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS FIXED AT THE MOMENT
BECAUSE W WE ONLY NEED THIS TO WORK WELL ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN USE IT FOR SOMETHING AND YOU GOT WORK RATS
SO
AND HOW MANY MODELS DO YOU NEED TO COMPLETION
AND HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE
AND YOU GOT
AND YOU KNOW ABOUT COMPLEXITY
YOU'RE WAITING ON MARLOES
YOU CAN COLD CALL HER TODAY THIS AFTERNOON
MM-HMM
THAT'S HER JOB
COME ON
OH YEAH
OKAY
SO YOU CAN DASH IN THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR AT A TIME
DOESN'T SOUND VERY USEFUL FOR YOU
UH-HUH
OKAY WELL
YOU GUYS SORT IT OUT
MM-HMM
RIGHT BUT IT WOULD BE KIND TO TELL HER AHEAD OF TIME WHICH OF YOUR MORNING SESSIONS YOU'RE BUMPED
YEAH
MM-HMM
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE PROBLEM THAT YOUR MORNINGS WEREN'T SLICED OFF ON THE BOOKING SYSTEM
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I IF YOU'RE SA TOLD USE THE BOOKING SYSTEM
YEAH
AND WHAT ARE THE INSTR WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS HAVE UM I YOU KNOW AS RULES ABOUT WHO YOU HAND THE KEYS TO
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WE LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW TO GROUND THE OH I THOUGHT THE THE LENDING FOR THE BOOKING SYSTEM CAROLINE
SEE 'CAUSE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO UH HAVE TRAINING IN
OH OKAY SO THAT'S THE SAFETY
AND YOU CONTROL THOSE ACCOUNTS
OH OKAY THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH
OKAY
UH-HUH YEAH
THAT'S SAFER
'CAUSE THEN THEY LEARN THE FIRST TIME
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
I REALLY HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE
SO UM WHAT ELSE IS IMPORTANT BEFORE YOU RUN
NOTHING RIGHT
YOU GOT UH WILLING HEADS
OH I DON'T THINK I BROUGHT MY DIARY UP
UH BUT MAYBE
WHY
OKAY
SO
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
SO DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME OF DAY YOU MIGHT WANT
'CAUSE I SHOULD C I SHOULD CHECK THAT
OKAY
YOU ALL HAVE TO B YOU'LL HAVE TO BE THERE TO WHEN IT FALLS OVER
YEAH
OKAY
SO THAT ALL SOUNDS F GOOD FUN
WELL I CAN JUST LEAVE YOU GUYS HERE YOU KNOW
WHY NOT
WHICH DATA
YOU KNOW I I WANT EVERYTHING AND THEN I'LL DECIDE WHAT I WANT
OKAY
WE CAN GET BACK TO IT
WE CAN GET WE CAN ALWAYS GET BACK TO IT
WE'RE NOT TH ACTUALLY THROWING ANYTHING AWAY
AND IF WE DECIDE TO RE JIG THIS AT SOME FINER
MECHA METHOD
WE'LL STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL AND A METHOD OF UH OF FILTERING
SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
AS LONG AS THE FORMAT IN WHICH WE PICK IT UP IS A FORMAT WHICH COULD BE GENERALISED TO A FINER TAKE
BECAUSE THE WORST THING THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN TO YOU IS YOU DISCOVER THAT YOU'VE DONE HUGE AMOUNTS OF ANALYSIS AND TH YOU ACTUALLY HAD THE DATA BUT YOU THREW IT AWAY BECAUSE YOU TREATED IT SO GROSSLY
OKAY
SO WHATEVER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO B YOU KNOW BACKTRACK AND SAY OKAY INSTEAD OF EVERY SECOND EVERY TENTH OF A SECOND OR SOME SUCH THING
BUT YOU KNOW TH
WELL THE EYE TRACKER DOES
MM-HMM
WELL YOU NEED
WELL ONE NEEDS TO KNOW THE DURATION OF THESE THINGS RIGHT
SO ONE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL SO THERE'S NO REAL TIME THERE'S ONLY EV THERE'S ONLY EVENTS
WHAT I'M WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHETHER WE'VE THROWN TIME AWAY
HERE
OKAY
SO ONE OF THE FORMATS IN WHICH EYE TRACKER DATA IS ANALYSED IS PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT ON SOME TARGET AS OPPOSED TO SOME COMPETITOR OVER THE FIRST SECOND AFTER SOME EVENT
OKAY
SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE SHU HAVE TO SHOW AT SOME TIME SLICE RATE WHETHER THE EYE WAS ON THE SAME TARGET AS THE OTHER GUY
A SIMILAR TARGET WHAT WE'D BOTH BEEN DEALI YOU KNOW
SO WE HAVE TO B WE HAVE ALL THE PARTS THE INTERESTING PARTS OF THE SCREEN IDENTIFIED AND BE ABLE TO SHOW DISTRIBUTION OF GAZE OVER TIME
ALRIGHT
NOW WE COULD BE REALLY UNLUCKY AND SOMEBODY WOULD EXPECT US TO DO THAT AT THE REAL FRAME RATE
BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY UNLUCKY
BUT BUT MY POINT IS THAT WE MUSTN'T THROW AWAY IN OR LOSE THE CAPACITY OF BEING ABLE TO DELIVER THAT KIND OF DATA
MM-HMM
MM
S SO TYPICALLY THE EYE WILL MOVE RIGHT
SO OVER ANY ONE SECOND THEY EYE'S ACTUALLY F FIXING ON A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS
AND YOU AND SO WHEN YOU SAY THE EYE WAS ON THIS FROM HERE TO HERE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THAT IS THAT IF YOU USE THE REAL FRAME RATE
IT'S GONNA JIGGLE ALL OVER THE PLACE
IT'S GONNA BE ON THIS LANDMARK
UH IT'S ON THIS OBJECT THAT OBJECT THIS FIXED THING THAT FIXED THING OKAY
YOU'RE GONNA GET LOTS AND LOTS OF STUFF
AND IT'S PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
IT'S NOT UH I WENT HERE
I S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE PERSON WALKING
I WENT HERE I STAYED HERE
IT'S IT'S MORE LIKE A FLY HOVERING
MM-HMM
BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU TAKE THEM AS SEPARATE EVENTS YOU GET THOUSANDS OF SEPARATE EVENTS
MM-HMM
AGAINST BIGGER FRAMES
WELL THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PROBLEM
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DOING IT
ONE IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A CUT OFF RIGHT
BUT THE OTHER IS THAT THERE WILL BE A TIME SPAN A KIND OF REACTION TO SOME EVENT SPAN
RIGHT
RIGHT
AND SO I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE REALLY TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS
ONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME OVERALL IN WHICH TWO PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME THING OKAY
AND ONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SEQUENCES OF THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT THE SAME THING AND THEN THEY BROKE IT
OR THEY DID LOOK AT THE SAME THING AND THEN THEY DID OR DIDN'T BREA YOU KNOW
ONE ONE COULD IMAGINE THOSE TWO CATEGORIES
THAT'S THAT'S A KIND OF TESTING OF OUR HYPOTHESES
BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UM DUES YOU PAY TO THE WAY THEY DO THINGS IN THE LITERATURE TO GET YOUR PAPERS PUBLISHED
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW IS AN EVENT SERIES AFTER SOME CRITICAL EVENT RIGHT
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TIME IS GIVEN TO LOOKING WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS LOOKING
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TIME OVER SOME YOU KNOW REASONABLE TIME SPAN OF A COUPLE OF SECONDS ALRIGHT
SO THEY'LL BE THEY THEY'LL WANT TO SEE ESSENTIALLY THE GAZE SETTLING ON PARTICULAR INCIDENTS ON PARTICULAR PLACES
SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THOSE TWO THINGS AND THEY'RE RATHER DIFFERENT DEMANDS
RIGHT
OR HOW L ALRIGHT
LET'S LET'S IMAGINE A TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION EVENT OKAY
THERE IS SOME PART THERE ARE THERE ARE SEPARATE MOVABLE PARTS ON THE SCREEN READY FOR USE RIGHT
THERE MAY BE OR NOT A CONSTRUCTION ALREADY BEGUN RIGHT
SOMEBODY MAKES THE FIRST MOVE
THERE'S SOME KIND OF COMMUNICATION EITHER GESTURAL IMAGINARY OR VERBAL THAT PLANS HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT RIGHT
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS THE PERSON WHO SPEAKS IS GOING TO DO SOME KIND OF VISUAL SCANNING
WHILE THEY'RE SPEAKING OR COMMUNICATING IN SOME WAY THE OTHER PERSON MAY OR MAY NOT BE LOOKING WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING OKAY
THEY MAY BE OVERLAPPING GAZE AT PARTICULAR OBJECTS WHICH ARE OF INTEREST
LET'S CALL IT THE C THE CONSTRUCT EXISTING CONSTRUCT WHICH COULD BE ZERO
ALRIGHT
OR THE UM THE ADDENDUM THE THING WHICH IS NEXT GOING TO BE ADDED
NEXT PIECE OKAY
NOW IN NEITHER CASE WHEN YOU DRAW THIS HE'S LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE WHICH YOU'RE ACTUALLY DRAWING YOU KNOW
FOR A THE PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH HE'S STEADILY LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE IS GONNA BE VERY VERY SHORT RIGHT
BECAUSE STARING FIXEDLY WITHOUT INTERRUPTION BLINK OR OR SACCADE IS IS AN EXTREMELY SHORT EVENT
THAT'S FINE
SO IT'S IN A REGION IT'S IN A REGION
OKAY
BUT EVEN SO YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET BOUNCING IN AND OUT OF THE REGION RIGHT
SO EVEN SO YOU WANNA LOOK AT IF WE'RE INTERESTED IN HOW LONG BEFORE THE CONSTRUCTION MOVE TAKES PLACE
UM HOW MUCH OF THE TIME THEY SPEND LOOKING AT THE SAME THING
LET'S CALL THAT OUR MEASURE OF ALIGNMENT
SO THEY'RE GONNA BE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT A. IS GONNA BE ON TRIANGLE ONE AND VARIOUS OTHER PLACES
THAT'S RIGHT
AND AND B. UM OKAY
AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF OF THAT TIME WHERE THEY'RE BOTH IN THE SAME REGION
RIGHT
SO WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE DON'T UM SIMPLIFY DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
TEMPORARILY SIMPLIFY TOO MUCH SO THAT YEAH
'CAUSE THEN YOU LOSE PERCENTAGE AS AN AS A AS A D. V.
RIGHT
AND SO B. HAS SOME PERIODS OF LOOKING AT ONE AND ALL IT WILL WHICH WILL ALSO BE INTERMITTENT
BECAUSE
RIGHT
MM-HMM
WHEN THEY SHOULD BE
RIGHT
OKAY
MM-HMM
WELL
IT
RIGHT
WHAT
YES
YES BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE FOR PART OF THAT TIME BOTH B. AND A. ARE PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT OKAY
IF IF YOUR INTENTION IS TO MOVE THE RED TRIANGLE TO SIT ON TOP OF THE THING ALREADY CONSTRUCTED YOU WOULD TEND TO LOOK BACK AND FORTH
RIGHT
AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO FIGURE THAT OUT
YEAH SURE
SO SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE UNDER WHAT TOOL SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THESE EVENTS
SO
RIGHT
SO SO ESSENTIALLY THERE'S THERE'S UM A. E. IS DIVIDED INTO T. R. ONE AND C. AND OTHER STUFF OKAY WHERE C. IS THE CONSTRUCT THE EXISTING THING
WELL NO
I MEAN WE'D TAKE A SEPARATE WE'D LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE TIME I MEAN I HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE LOOK WHEN THEY'RE BUILDING THINGS TOGETHER
OKAY
SO THERE'S A THERE'S THE ADDENDUM AND THE AND THE CO THE EXISTING CONSTRUCT
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA SPEND MORE TIME LOOKING AT ONE OR THE OTHER
BUT IF THEY'RE WHATEVER IT IS THAT ONE IS LOOKING AT IF THE OTHER'S LOOKING THE SAME PLACE THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE
YEAH
SURE SURE
AND THAT'S WHAT THE OTHER STUFF THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THE DIAGONAL STRIPES ARE FOR
THAT'S TRUE
BUT WE C WE CAN ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL BE DOING IS UM CATEGORISING PEOPLE I TAKE IT OR INTERACTIONS BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE SPEND LOOKING AT THE CLOCK
WE'D EXPECT THAT IF WE PUT PEOPLE UNDER TIME PRESSURE THEY'LL LOOK AT THE CLOCK A LOT MORE
SURE IT'S A SEPARATE ANALYSIS
BUT YOU DON'T WANNA THROW IT AWAY RIGHT
SO SO YOU CAN DEFINE IF ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY CATEGORISED BY THE EYE TRACKER AS TO WHERE THE EYE IS ALRIGHT
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL OUT ANY INTERESTING CATEGORY AND SAY ALRIGHT FOR THIS PHASE IT'S T. R. ONE OR C.
FOR THIS PHASE IT'S UM S. Q. ONE OR C. OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY TRANSCRIBE THE THING OR WATCH THE FILM FURTHER ON
YEAH
YEAH ABSOLUTELY
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S THE ADDENDUM IN THE CONSTRUCT SHOULD BE YOU KNOW KIND OF THEY THEY CHANGE THEIR TRUE IDENTITY
BUT THEY'RE I THEIR CATEGORIES OF STUFF NOW I W MY KIND OF ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THAT THIS WAS J. P. LAND
THAT THAT'S WHAT HE WAS RE WHAT HE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN WAS THE KIND OF CODING WHICH WOULD DEFINE THE BUILDING SEQUENCE OKAY
SO AND
THE AND MAYBE HE WANTS TO THINK ABOUT THAT MORE AND SAY WELL THERE WERE SEVERAL CANDIDATES FOR THE ADDENDUM ALRIGHT
AND AND IT WAS THE NEGOTIATION OF WHICH CANDIDATE WAS GONNA BE THE RIGHT CANDIDATE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE INTERESTING STUFF
SO I SHOULD TALK TO HIM ABOUT THIS
HE'S HE'S ACTUALLY UM EMAILED ME WITH A L WITH A LIST OF THINGS HE WANTS TO DISCUSS AT LENGTH
SO I W I'LL BRING THIS ONE BACK TO HIM
WELL THIS IS MY QUESTION FOR HIM
IS HE GONNA DEFINE THIS KIND OF BUILDING SEQUENCE IN A WAY THAT WE CAN GET OUT
OR IS HE SO B I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON CONSTRUCTION THERE FOR A WHILE
SO IT MAY BE THAT THEY HAVE A CODING SYSTEM THAT'S READY TO GO AND WE SHOULD JUST APPLY IT
OKAY
UM THEY DO A LOT OF SUB ASSEMBLY IN THE TASKS THEY'VE BEEN DOING
SO THEY MAY WELL HAVE A YEAH
LET'S FIND OUT
RIGHT
RIGHT
SO WHA RIGHT
WHAT WELL WE BUT WE HAVE THE NOW ACTIONS I MEAN ACTIONS MIGHT MOSTLY BE THEIRS RIGHT
BUT SINCE WE HAVE THE THE EYE TRACKER I TH WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT GAZE RIGHT
YEAH I RIGHT
BUT UM SO THEY'LL THEY'LL UH THEY'LL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
BUT UM PRESUMABLY WHAT YOU PIOUSLY HOPE IS HAPPENS HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH UM TRANSACTIONS
RIGHT THAT THE VERBAL ANALYSIS AND THE UM AND THE VISUAL ANALYSIS GIVE YOU THE SAME BREAKING POINTS THE SAME CHUNKING POINTS
WELL I MEAN WHAT YOU KNOW
IT'S IT IS IT IS A TASK BREAKDOWN
BUT FOR THE VERBAL VERSION THERE ARE WAYS OF ANNOUNCING THAT NOW WE'RE DOING A NEW ONE RIGHT
OR THAT WE'RE FINISHED WITH THE OLD ONE
NO YOU WOULDN'T
BUT I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH YOU KNOW
AS AN AS AN OUTCOME OF THIS IS THAT YOU COULD ANALYSE EITHER END AND YOU'D GET THE SAME CHUNKING OF THE MATERIAL
THE THING WHICH YOU GUYS THOUGHT TO MAKE IN A PAPER
IT'S A HYPOTHESIS
WELL
THEY ARE DOING THESE THINGS TOGETHER
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ONE COULD IMAGINE DOING IS UM SEN IS YOU KNOW
HAVING THE TRANSCRIPTION THERE AND PL JUST PLAY IT BACK TO A BUNCH OF CAPTIVE UNDERGRADUATES AND SAY WHEN DO THEY STOP AND START
UM BECAUSE BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT UM CYCLING SEQUENCES IN DISCOURSE
AND IF THE DISCOURSE TELLS YOU WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S INFORMATION
I MEAN I G ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS HOW THE INFORMATION IS GONNA BE SHARED ACROSS THESE MEDIA
AND IF YOU CAN GET IT ALL OUT OF THE SPEECH YOU KNOW IF THE IF ALL OF THE CHUNKING IS AVAILABLE WHEN THERE IS SPEECH
OKAY THEN IT'S CARRYING A LOT OF THE BURDEN
IT'S SAYING WE ARE DONE WITH THAT AND
MM
BUT THIS IS BUT WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT DATA LIKE THIS WITH THIS WITH OUR OLD FASHIONED ANALYSES UM YOU KNOW
AND I IT'S IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO KNOW THAT THAT MUCH INFORMATION THAT CHUNKING OF THE TASK INFORMATION IS BEING CARRIED BY THE LANGUAGE
BECAUSE J. P. 'S QUESTION THE OVERRIDING QUESTION IS SO WHAT'S LANGUAGE FOR
YOU KNOW
IF PEOPLE ARE BUSY INTERACTING ALL THE TIME AND ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO CONTROL FOR WHETHER PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER WHEN THEY'RE DOING THESE JOINT TASKS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE IRRELEVANT 'CAUSE LANGUAGE IS IRRELEVANT
IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE NICE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN A PLACE WHERE WE'RE CONTROLLING WHETHER YOU HAVE LANGUAGE OR NOT
YOU COULD GET THE ENTIRE CHUNKING OF THE TASK OUT OF A LANGUAGE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S A SELF CONTAINED SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO A SYSTEM WHICH IS WHICH CAN'T BE INTERPRETED WITHOUT THE OTHER SYSTEM
OKAY
USUALLY THE CLAIM
ALMOST ALL STUDIES ON LANGUAGE CLAIM THAT LANGUAGE IS A SELF CONTAINED SYSTEM WHICH WILL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
THAT'S THE CLAIM
ALRIGHT
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS TRUE
I SAID THAT'S THE CLAIM
AND SO IT'S WORTH TESTING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO NO
AND WE WON'T AND ESTABLISHING THE FULL SET WILL YOU KNOW TAKE US MUCH OF THE PROJECT
SO YOU KNOW
FINE
MY ONLY CONCERN W UH YOU A AS I SAID WHEN I BARGED IN WAS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T LOSE THE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO PICK UP LATER
THAT'S ALL
EVERY SINGLE FRAME
WELL
OKAY
BUT SINCE THE L THE DEFINITIONS OF LOOK A THING WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE D UM ARE THE ONES WHICH GET RID OF THE LOWER LEVEL
LIKE JIGGLING AROUND IN THE AREA OF A PARTICULAR OBJECT RIGHT
SO IF WE'RE MOVING THE THE GREEN TRIANGLE UM WE'VE DEFINED A REGION WHICH IS THE DYNAMICALLY THE GREEN TRIANGLE WHEREVER IT IS
WE WILL JIGGLE AROUND IN THERE
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE ARE IN THERE
THAT'S BENEATH OUR LEVEL OF ANALYSIS
S
WELL THE IN THAT INTERPRETATION IS DEFINABLE TO FRAME RATE BY OUR BY THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA USE FRAME RATE
I C WELL I MEAN I BECAUSE I CAN I CAN SAY FOR HOW MANY FRAMES THIS FIXATION WENT IS OFFICIALLY DEFINED
SO THAT AS LONG AS I AS LONG AS IT'S NOT A UNTIMED EVENT OKAY
A AND AN END TIME
SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S FINE
I CAN SAY IT'S A LONG ONE
OR IT'S A SHORT ONE
OR IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S TWENTY MILLISECONDS MORE THAN THAT ONE
THAT'S
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND OKAY I'M I'M ASKING YOU AS AN EXPERT
THIS IS THIS THIS ISN'T A LEADING QUESTION
THIS IS A QUESTION QUESTION
WHY WOULD THAT BE INFORMATIVE PARTICULARLY
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
ON IT
SO YOU THINK THAT IF FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT UM ONE OR ANOTHER UM APEX OF A TRIANGLE IT WOULD JUST THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE
THEY WERE EXPLORING THE THING AS OPPOSED TO THEY WERE SIMPLY ALRIGHT THERE IS IT THERE IT IS
OKAY SO TH UM SO THAT REALLY MEANS THAT WE'RE NOT THROWING AWAY ABSOLUTE FIXATIONS
THE SCREEN LOCATION OF ABSOLUTE FIXATIONS
ALRIGHT
UH-HUH
AS OPPOSED TO OUT OF IT
SO YOU SO I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD YOU TO MEAN EXPLORING THE FIGURE
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR FIXATION IS A POINT
AND THE FIGURES ARE BIGGER THAN POINTS
SO YOU COULD BE EXPLORING THE FIGURE OR YOU COULD BE JUST SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION DEFINED AS THE FIGURE BUT NOT ON IT
OKAY
ALRIGHT FINE
THE
SO YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW THE VARIABILITY OF THE OF THE FIXATION
AND WOULDN'T THAT DIFFER FROM PERSON TO PERSON
OKAY
SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SPOTS WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE EYE HAS FIXED THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIX OH OK OKAY
SO IT'S A JIGGLE RATE OKAY
RIGHT
MM-HMM
WELL ALL I TH UNDERSTOOD YOU TO ASK FOR WAS THE DURATION OF EACH FIXATION INSIDE
YEAH
YOU CAN COME BACK
OKAY
RIGHT
SO IT'S THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIXATIONS
WELL ACTUALLY DO YOU WANT THE AVERAGE DURATION
OR DO YOU WANT THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ONES
DURATION OF EACH FIXATION IN THE REGION
WELL YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THAT
SO THAT'S A MEASURE OF JIGGLE IN THE REGION ROUGHLY
MOVING
OKAY
WHAT'S OUR ERROR OF MEASUREMENT ON LOCATION ON THE SCREEN
SO TO WHAT DEGREE DO WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHETHER THE TWO LITTLE EYES LITTLE CIRCLES ARE EXACTLY IN THE SAME PLACE OR JUST SOMEWHERE IN THE SAME REGION
RIGHT OKAY
RIGHT
MM-HMM
IT'S YEAH OKAY RIGHT
S
OKAY
SO MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT THE THE MOUSE IS A DYNAMIC OBJECT RIGHT
THE EYE TRACK IS A DYNAMIC OBJECT
OR IS IT ONLY THE THE PIECE THAT THE EYE TRA THE OTHER PERSON'S EYE TRACK IS ON THAT'S THAT'S AN OBJECT IN THIS DEFINITION
IS A IS AN OBJECT
OKAY
WITH SOME WITH PLUS OR MINUS SOMETHING OR OTHER YEAH AROUND IT
SOME CIRCULAR AREA
OKAY
AND
UM SO YOU CAN BE ON THE OBJECT BUT NOT ON THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE
SO THERE CAN BE A TRIANGLE WHICH HAS A. 'S GAZE IN THE CENTRE AND YOUR GAZE ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO BE HERE
YOU'RE IN THE TRIANGLE REGION
DOES THIS
OKAY
BUT IT'S DIRECTLY ADDED WHEN WHEN THESE TWO IN THIS SITUATION WHEN THESE TWO OVERLAP RIGHT LIKE THIS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL IT WOULD COME UP IT WOULD SAY YES RIGHT
I MEAN BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN THE SAME PLACE
SO IF YOU Y YOU'RE GONNA HAVE DYNAMIC REGIONS WHICH OVERLAP ONE ANOTHER BY DEFINITION
IF THE MOUSE IS ON THE CONSTRUCT THEN RIGHT RIGHT
RIGHT
WE TREAT THOSE AS AS OTHER OBJECTS
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE THE PARTS OF THE C THING TO BE CONSTRUCTED IS THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO OVERLAP WITH OTHER THINGS SO NOTHING BREAKS
OKAY
IF WE MM-HMM
YE
MM-HMM
YES AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY LOOKING AT SOMEBODY'S GAZE WHEN THE MOUSE ISN'T ALSO THERE RIGHT
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW THOSE THINGS
RIGHT THEY'RE I THEY'RE INDEPENDENT DYNAMIC OBJECTS
OKAY
SO A DEFINITION OF WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT AND TOUCHING THE SAME THING
SO IMAGINE THAT WE'VE JUST ADDED A PIECE TO THE CONSTRUCT ALRIGHT
SO NOW THAT'S THE CONSTRUCT
AND BOTH MOUSE SYMBOLS ARE ON IT RIGHT
AND BOTH GAZES ARE ON IT RIGHT
SO AT THAT POINT YOU SHOULD HAVE A LINE UP OF A. IS ON THE CONSTRUCT A. IS ON THE MOUSE
A. IS ON A. IS ON A. 'S MOUSE A. IS ON B. 'S MOUSE A. IS ON B. 'S GAZE AND B. LIKEWISE
OKAY
RIGHT
OOH I LOVE THE ERASER
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT THE MOUSE IS ALSO A DYNAMIC OBJECT
THAT'S FINE
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
AND THEN YOU THEN YOU LOOK FOR COMBINATIONS OF THEM
YEAH
I THINK WE NEED TO
BECAUSE THA SOME MEASURE OF ALIGNMENT IS LOOKING WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS DIRECTING ATTENTION
AND THERE ARE TWO MEASURES OF WHERE THE OTHER GUY IS DIRECTING ATTENTION THAT YOU GET FROM THE VISUAL TRACK
ONE IS WHERE THE MOUSE IS AND THE OTHER IS WHERE THE GAZE IS
SO
MM-HMM
RIGHT
RIGHT
SO
YEAH THAT ACTUALLY TRUE
BE 'CAUSE
RIGHT
BUT THAT IT'S ALSO GONNA BE THE CASE THAT UM WHATEVER REGION YOU DEFINE AS THE REGION OF THE DYNAMIC OBJECT OF THE RED TRIANGLE MAY GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT OVERLAPS THE REGION OF THE DYNAMIC OBJECT OF THE GREEN SQUARE
OKAY WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT
YEAH BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THEM CLOSE TOGETHER THERE'S ALWAYS SOME FUZZ FACTOR AROUND THEM
AND SO IF THEY'RE LEFT LYING CLOSE TOGETHER OKAY OR IN THE IN FACT IN THE MODEL IN THE NOT IN THE MODEL
IN THE IN THE SUPPLIES SET THEY'RE ACTUALLY NEATLY PACKED INTO A LITTLE SPACE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SQUEAK SQUEAK
YES
BECAUSE THE TWO ARE SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THEIR REGIONS OVERLAP
MM-HMM
THE GREATEST OVERLAP WITH WHAT
HO HO
I THINK I THINK YOU'RE THROWING INFORMATION AWAY
YEAH
BUT IT MAY BE A BAD IDEA
IT MAY BE A BAD IDEA
YOU'VE JUST THROWN DATA AWAY
YEAH
J
WELL
THE GAZE WILL WOBBLE
THE GAZE WILL WOBBLE
THAT'S NATURAL
MM-HMM
OR INDEED THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
D OR DECIDING WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE OR THINKING SO YOU DON'T WANT TO DECIDE IT'S ONLY ONE AND THROW THE OTHER ONE OUT
MM-HMM
OKAY WELL THAT'S FINE
THAT I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT'S THE OBVIOUS WAY TO DO IT
WELL EACH ONE IS YES OR NO
COUPLE OF DOZEN
RIGHT
SIX TO A DOZEN USUALLY
MM-HMM
YEAH
I MEAN I THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT UM IF PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING F MM-HMM
WELL NOT IF THE REGIONS OVERLAP OKAY
IF THE REGIONS I
RIGHT
AND IF YOU DEFINE THE REGIONS SO NEATLY THAT THERE'S THAT
YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE LOSING GAZE BECAUSE OF JIGGLE OUTSIDE THIS CLOSELY DEFINED REGION WHEN IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF SPACE THEN
I MEAN I I ACTUALLY LIKE THE SOLUTION HOWEVER UGLY IT IT LOOKS IN TERMS OF A DATA FORMAT OF HAVING A TRACK FOR EVERY POSSIBLE OBJECT OF GAZE
MM-HMM
S A THING
MM-HMM
WELL OKAY
SO
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS BRILLIANT
YEAH IT IS BIG AND YOU DO HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH IT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
BUT IT GIVES YOU A VERY CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON
YEAH WELL OKAY
BUT SO WE'D WE'D BETTER DO A TEST ONE AND AND LISTEN TO THEM SCREAM
WITH PARTS
RIGHT
SO I MEAN SO
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO WHAT ABOUT THE POINT WHERE A PART BECOMES THE CONSTRUCT
DO YOU STILL IDENTIFY IT AS A PART
I MEAN I THINK ONE SHOULD LOSE THAT I TAKE IT
'CAUSE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
SO YOU CHA SO EVERY TIME A PART IS ADDED TO THE CONSTRUCT IT BECOMES A NEW PART
SO THE CONSTRUCT ACTUALLY UM HAS SAY IT HAS SIX THINGS THAT ARE ADDED TO SOME INITIAL THING OKAY
SO IF THERE'S JUST THE INITIAL THING YOU'VE PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN THAT'S JUST THE INITIAL OBJECT RIGHT
SOON AS YOU PUT A PART THERE'S A CONSTRUCT
BUT IT'S CONSTRUCT ONE
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ADD ANOTHER PART CONSTRUCT ONE CEASES TO EXIST AND YOU GET CONSTRUCT TWO RIGHT
SO ACTUALLY DEFINING ALL OF THOSE AS THE CONSTRUCT IS GONNA BE THE TRICKIEST THING
RIGHT
SO YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE RIGHT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT CEASES TO EXIST
'CAUSE YOU CAN BUILD SUB ASSEMBLIES
AND THEN YOU CAN START AGAIN
ALSO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SCREW IT UP YOU G START AGAIN
BECAUSE THE DEFINITION
MM-HMM
WELL THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE POPPING OUT OF EXISTENCE
SO DO WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UM WE BROKE IT AND IT WENT AWAY AND UM IT'S NOW PART OF THE CONSTRUCT
CAN WE TA CAN WE TAG THE CONSTRUCTS WITH WHAT'S IN THEM
YEAH
OKAY
SO WE COULD WE COULD ESSENTIALLY WELL
THEN WE COULD CUMULATI OR IT IS A NEW CONSTRUCT 'CAUSE IT HAS A NEW LIST OF A NEW CUMULATIVE LIST OF PARTS RIGHT
BUT WE WILL
RIGHT
SO
SO SOME FANCY PROGRAMMING'S GONNA HAVE TO BE DONE TO SAY I WAS LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE AND NOW I'M LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE IN CONSTRUCT ONE
'CAUSE THE FIRST CONSTRUCT WAS TRIANGLE ONE AND SQUARE ONE OKAY
ALRIGHT
SO NOW WE HAVE TO ASK WHETHER UM
SO L LET'S IMAGINE THIS WE'VE MADE A CONSTRUCT OF TWO PARTS AND WE'RE C I A TRIANGLE AND A SQUARE
AND WE'RE CONSIDERING NOW ADDING SOMETHING ON TO THE SIDE OF THE SQUARE THAT ISN'T ATTACHED TO THE TRIANGLE
OKAY
ARE WE LOOKING AT THE SQUARE OR WE LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT
YEAH
UH IN THIS DEFINIT SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT
THERE ISN'T A WAY TO FIGURE OUT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SQUARE RATHER THAN THE TRIANGLE
MM-HMM
IT IS
WELL
OKAY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE EXAMPLE M F PRESUMABLY THAT'S THE BEST EXAMPLE OF OVERLAPPING OVERLAPPING AREAS
'CAUSE IF IF THE THING THE TWO S THE TWO THINGS ARE NOW ABUTTED
OF COURSE THERE'S AN AREA WHICH IS COMMON TO BOTH OF THEM OKAY
UM SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO RUN THROUGH IN MY HEAD IS THAT WE CAN ALWAYS TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UM SOMETHING GOING OUT OF EXISTENCE 'CAUSE IT'S JOINED TO CONSTRUCT SOMETHING GOING OUT OF EXISTENCE 'CAUSE WE THREW IT AWAY
RIGHT
SUPPOSE WE PICK UP AN WE WE WE SCREWED UP THE FIRST TIME WE PUT THE TRIANGLE WITH THE SQUARE AND WE THREW IT AWAY AND DECIDED WE DIDN'T LIKE IT
AND WE TOOK ANOTHER ONE
IS IT TRIANGLE ONE
IS IT TRIANGLE ONE PRIME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT'S THE REPLACEMENT FOR TRIANGLE ONE
MM-HMM
WELL HOW DO I KNOW WHAT IT REPLACES
N N
UH THIS IS TRUE
BUT IF I HAVE TRIANGLES ONE TWO THREE RIGHT AND I THROW THEM AWAY ANY TRIANGLES I TAKE OUT ARE TO REPLACE ONE TWO THREE
OKAY
EXCEPT THAT EX NO YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE THEY'RE MEANT TO REPLACE
BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO REPLACE ANY THAT ARE ALL THAT ARE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN THROWN AWAY
OKAY
RIGHT
SO THE NEW PARTS ARE REPLACING THOSE WHICH HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE SCREEN
AND IF THERE'S NO MORE T. R. ONE TRACK THE T. R. ONE TRACK IS GONE NOW
OH THERE ARE MANY
SAME IDENTITY
OH IS THAT TRUE
YOU'VE DECIDED NOT TO MAKE ALL THE TRIANGLES RED AND SQUARES GREEN AND
OH OKAY
RIGHT
ONE TWO AND THREE
THEY
OKAY
SO
SO THERE
SO SHAPE PLUS COLOUR
OKAY
THEY'RE UNIQUE
ALL THE PARTS ARE UNIQUE
SO WAI HANG ON
THAT MAKES THE TASK A LITTLE BIT EASIER RIGHT
THE UH ALL THE LINES
SO
INDEED
WHICH KIND OF LEAVES YOU WITH AN OBVIOUS WAY OF MAKING THE SAME TASK HARDER AND EASIER DOESN'T IT
BUT BUT THAT'S HARD TO CODE
I MEAN THAT'S REALLY A THING WE MIGHT DO
OKAY
SO NOW LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THE CODING WOULD SURVIVE THAT
IT'S JUST IT'S A BEAUTIFULLY CONTROLLED SITUATION
THE CONSTRUCTION TASK IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME
IT'S THE FIGURING OUT STUFF THAT GETS HARDER IF EVERYTHING IS PURPLE
FOR A JUST TO CHOOSE A COLOUR AT RANDOM HERE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO IF YOU HAVE FIVE BLACK TRIANGLES THERE GONNA BE FIVE BLACK TRIANGLES IN THE PARTS BOX
OR ONE
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
AS LONG AS IT THIS IS POSSIBLE
SO C THAT THAT JUST IS A KIND OF THING WHICH IS SO SIMPLE
SO MUCH LIKE A SINGLE ONE ZERO VARIABLE CHANGE THAT IT IF IT THAT DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST
'CAUSE I'M TR I'M TRYING TO KINDA MAP THIS ONTO BAUFIX
UM AND BAUFIX HAS HAS MULTIPLE YOU KNOW ALL THE THE
THE THE V THE NUTS ARE ARE RED OR AND ALL THE UM FLAT THINGS ARE WOOD COLOUR SOMETHING
THE SAME PART THE SAME PART IS DIFFERENT COLOURS
OH YEAH
SO WHEN YOU SAY A RED NUT OR A GREEN BOLT OR A LONG GREEN BOLT THEN THERE'LL BE LOTS OF THEM LYING AROUND
AND I THINK THAT'S HOW THE ROBOT IS SET UP TO THERE ARE FIVE FIVE GREEN BOLTS
UH HERE IS ONE YOU KNOW
OKAY
OKAY
SO
OKAY
SO W UH ALL I'M I'M DOING IS KIND OF WORRYING OUT LOUD ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN THAT WE'LL MISS BY TH A SIMPLE VIEW OF FOR EXAMPLE REGIONS AND LOOKING AT AT TRIANGLE ONE
WHEN IS TRIANGLE ONE NOT TRIANGLE ONE ANYMORE
UM DOES IT S KEEP ITS IDENTITY
MM
IDENTITY YES
MM-HMM
THAT'S TRUE
SO HOW CAN WE DEFINE THE SHAPES THAT PEOPLE BUILD
WELL
IF ASSUMING I WAS FOR A MOMENT I WAS J. P. AND I WANTED TO KNOW HOW THEY ACTUALLY WENT ABOUT BUILDING THE THING
OKAY
AND I WANTED TO UM TO LOOK AT THE STRATEGY
AND I WANTED TO SEE IF THE STRATEGY WAS DIFFERENT WHEN WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT AND WHEN WE JUST PICKED UP WHATEVER
I MEAN SUPPOSE I CAN'T TALK TO YOU AND I'M DOING THIS TASK WITH YOU AND I CAN'T TALK TO YOU
UM
THE THING WHICH IS GONNA BE HARDEST FOR ME IS MAKING ELABORATE PLANS WITH YOU
I CAN REACH FOR THE NEXT THING AND YOU CAN GO WHERE I REACH
BUT IF I HAVE SOME YOU KNOW SUB GOAL SOME LONG TERM SUB GOAL
OF DOING SOMETHING CLEVER WITH PUTTING THESE TOGETHER 'CAUSE IT'S HARD AND THEN PUTTING THESE TOGETHER 'CAUSE IT'S HARD
THERE IT'S GONNA BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY THAT TO YOU
AND THE DIFFERENCE IN THE HISTORY OF CONSTRUCTION RIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT THING AND I WONDER HOW WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION BACK
DO YOU THINK
NO IT WHY IS NOT UH THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION I'M ASKING
THE QUESTION I'M ASKING IS WHAT'S THE HISTORY OF THE CONSTRUCT
SO YOU HAVE THE N THE NAMES OF THE THINGS IN THERE
AND YOU HAVE TWO CONSTRUCTS SUPPOSE WE HAVE TWO SUB CONSTRUCTS
AND WHICHEVER ONE HAD TWO PIECES PUT TOGETHER FIRST IS THE EARLIER NUMBERED OF THOSE CONSTRUCTS RIGHT
HOW DO YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADDING A PIECE TO THIS FIRST CONSTRUCT AND CREATING A SECOND CONSTRUCT
MM
OKAY
IT'S IT'S IT'S PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP
OKAY
SO CONSTRUCT TWO COULD B UM CONSTRUCT ONE IS UM A RED TRIANGLE AND A GREEN SQUARE
CONSTRUCT TWO IS UM TWO GREEN SQUARES OKAY
CONSTRUCT THREE RIGHT IS A RED TRIANGLE A GREEN SQUARE AND ANOTHER RED TRIANGLE
CONSTRUCT FOUR OKAY
OKAY
AND YOU CAN SO HOW ARE WE GONNA TELL WHEN FOR EXAMPLE YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO HUMAN CODING ON WHEN TWO SUB CONSTRUCTS ARE PUT TOGETHER
NO THAT'S A DEFINITION WHEREIN A CONSTRUCT HAS A C HAS CONSTRUCTS AS CHILDREN
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
SO WE COULD ZIP WE COULD ZIP THROUGH THIS AND LOOK AT ALL THE UM ALL THE INTERACTIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE BUILD SUB CONSTRUCT CONTSTRUCTS FIRST WHICH WE EXPECT THEM TO DO BU AS A WILD HYPOTHESIS MORE WHEN THEY HAVE VERBAL COMMUNICATION THAN WHEN THEY DON'T
OKAY
AND WE CAN DO THAT BY SIMPLY SEARCHING FOR ANY CONSTRUCTS THAT HAVE CONSTRUCTS AS CHILDREN
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MADE A RULE THAT YOU CAN'T UH COLLECT EXTRA PARTS RIGHT
NO NO
I MEAN YOU HAVE TO B YOU HAVE TO BREAK ONE TO GET ONE OKAY
AND YOU CAN'T JUST BRING EXTRAS IN CASE YOU SCREW UP
YOU HAVE TO SCREW UP FIRST AND THEN YOU CAN BRING AN EXTRA
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
I BUT IT DOES HAVE REPLACEMENT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THERE THERE'S A SO YOU SO SO YOU APPRECIATE YOU APPRECIATE THE COST OF
SCREWING UP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM THAT'S RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
SO THEY REJECTED SOMETHING OR THEY BROKE SOMETHING INADVERTANTLY
OKAY
IS THERE A WAY OF
TELLING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL BREAKAGES
BEC YEAH
NO YOU P THEY BOTH PUT THEY BOTH PUT THEIR HANDS ON A CONSTRUCT BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE IT
MM-HMM
YEP
SO THAT JUST HAS TO BE CODED
MM-HMM
UM NOT GENERICALLY
BECAUSE THEY'LL IF THEY'RE GONNA DO IT BY GESTURE THEY'LL BUILD UP A CONVENTION RIGHT
WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO KNOW
UNLESS THEY DEVELOP A CONVENTION
SUPPOSE THEY START OFF WITH LANGUAGE AND THEN THEY THEY SAY HEY LOOK YOU KNOW LET'S DO IT LIKE THIS
SURE
ABSOLUTELY
I JUST I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT A WISH LIST YES
YES
FOR SURE YOU KNOW THAT'S AND L OR WELL N IS NOT NECESSARILY INTENTIONAL
THEY COULD JUST SCREW UP
YEP
MM-HMM
OR I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY GOOD NO WE'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THAT WE'LL GET A BAD SCORE
LET'S JUST THROW THAT AWAY AND START AGAIN YEAH
OKAY
WHICH REMINDS WE HAVE FIXED THE SCORE PROBLEM
HAVE WE
RIGHT
WAS THE PERCENTAGE OVERLAP AND THAT MADE THE SCORE
YEAH
THAT'S WHEN I LEFT
OH YEAH WELL DO YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH WHICH WHICH ONE WAS THE TOP RIGHT
YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT THAT'S ALL BEEN FIXED
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S BACK
DON'T TELL ME IT WAS A FEATURE
ALRIGHT
OH OKAY
OH
SO
HMM
BUT
THE RIGHT
NOT PROMINENTLY FLAGGED
OKAY
A COMMUNICATION FLAW
OKAY
SO WE CAN NOW THAT'S NOW JUST LOVELY
AND THERE WON'T BE ANY CRAZY SCORES ANYMORE
OH
I HAVE TO USE A NEW PAGE
ALRIGHT
SO THE LAST I THINK I'M SORRY YOU KNOW I HAD AS ASSORTED EMAILS FROM YOU AND I WAS PROBABLY DIDN'T CATCH EVERYTHING
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THERE ARE TWO CAMTASIA RECORDS
THEY DON'T SEE THEIR OWN GAZE
THEY SEE THE O ONLY THE OTHER GUY'S GAZE RIGHT
HUH-HUH
OKAY
I MEAN
CHECK OUT
OKAY
SO WE
MM-HMM
IS THERE MM
IS THERE SUCH A THING UM AS UM YOU KNOW DUAL TRACK VIDEO
BECAUSE YOU CAN CERTAINLY MIX THINGS
UM WHAT IDEALLY ONE WANTS ONE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO L TO HAVE THESE THINGS
UH UM BECAUSE WE'RE USING THEM FOR BACK UP AND FOR CODING
WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO PLAY THEM INDEPENDENTLY
WE DO ALMOST ALWAYS WANT TO USE THEM IN EXACTLY IN PARALLEL
TIME ALIGNED
UM WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR SYNCHRONIZATION OTHERWISE
OKAY
SO THAT WE'D HAVE TO RE ALIGN THEM
WE COULDN'T DUMP THEM FROM THEIR START POINTS
WELL MAYBE YOU COULD
THE THING THAT YOU'RE DUMPING THEM ONTO JUST STARTS RUNNING WITH THE FLASH AND THE BLEEP
YOU TURN ON THE TWO COPIES WHENEVER AT DIFFERENT TIMES
BUT THEY'RE STILL NO
IS THE WHAT WHAT I TH WHAT ARE THEY I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE THE PARTS THAT ARE OPERATING HERE
TWO VIDEOS ARE TURNING ON
THERE IS NO TIME STAMP THAT COMES FROM SOME COMMON SOURCE
MM-HMM
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
RIGHT IS THERE A DIV MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO THEY'LL INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE UM THE EYE TRACKER CALIBRATION RIGHT WHICH IS NOT A BAD THING ACTUALLY
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU WANNA GO BACK AND FIND OUT IF THIS WAS JUST A PARTICULARLY DUFF SUBJECT
RIGHT
YEAH
AND HAND EVERY TIME WE RE CALIBRATED THE DAMN THING SLIPPED YEAH
THAT ACTUALLY HELPS
I MEAN THAT NI
RIGHT
YEP
MM-HMM
RIGHT
NO THEY THAT ACTUALLY SAVES YOU HOURS TRYING TO MAKE SOMEBODY'S DATA SMOOTH OUT WHEN IT WON'T
BECAUSE YEAH
THAT'S A TECHNICAL TERM
THAT'S A A TECHNICAL CATEGORIZATION IN PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
WELL WE NEED SOUND WE WE NEED REAL SOUND RECORDING RIGHT
THAT'S THAT'S TWO TRACK
THAT'S STEREO
ALRIGHT
UH-HUH
ON W ON WHAT
UH SORRY
UH
ON ONE OF THE
CON
O O IT'S UH
ON CAMTASIA
THAT'S OUR ONLY SOUND RECORD
MM
MM-HMM
HOW GOOD IS IT
YEAH
HAVE TO REALLY QUESTION
MM-HMM
AND THEN THEN THEY CAN DO SOUND ANALYSIS ON THAT
OH OKAY
RIGHT
SO WE THERE'S GONNA BE A WAY TO SOONER OR LATER TO ALIGN THE EYE TRACK CAMTASIA ONE CAMTASIA TWO WITH TWO SOUND CHANNELS
RIGHT
MM-HMM
AH THE BLEEP WE'LL FIND
MM
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
THEY UH THEY ALSO TEND TO HAVE A FUNNY FUNNY SHAPE BEEPS
SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH IS THERE AN END SIGNAL
WHEN YOU DECIDE IT'S ALL OVER DOES IT PING YOU BACK AND
RIGHT
OKAY
SO WHEN YOU'VE WHEN YOU'VE PRESSED WE'RE FINISHED IT PINGS BACK AT YOU
OKAY
IT'S JUST THAT ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING THINGS
AND SO UP SAVING A PERCENTAGE OF A TRIAL IS SOMETIMES A GOOD I YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO DO THAT IS SOMETIMES A GOOD IDEA
OKAY
CAN W
YEAH CAN WE DO CAN WE DO SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT
LIKE HAVING
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN IT'S IT'S CRAZY
WE'RE IN AN ANECHOIC ROOM WHICH WE SPECIALLY YEAH BUILT AN ANECHOIC
BUT YOU KNOW SOUND ROOM WHICH WE SPECIALLY BUILT FOR THIS
WE'RE D IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
WE SHOULDN'T SCREW IT UP MORE THAN WE HAVE TO
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THIS
NO
NO NO
DO YOU HAVE A POWERED MICROPHONE OR SOMETHING
RIGHT
THAT THE LINE IS STEREO THE INPUT IS MONO
RIGHT
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID
RIGHT
IS AH
THAT'S SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUND CARD
YEP
ITS OWN TRACK ITS OWN VIDEO
YOU HAVE TO ALIGN THE VIDEOS ANYWAY RIGHT
I
WELL I'M NOT THE TECHNICAL PERSON WHO WOULD DO IT
BUT I KNOW WHO TO ASK
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT IT'S THE SAME AS
MM-HMM
SAYS ROBIN THINKING ABOUT CUTTING AND SPLICING YEAH
YEAH OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I WANNA SEE SEVERAL OF THEM
I WANNA SEE I WANNA SEE ONE OF THEM UM LOOK REALLY NICE BEFORE WE START RUNNING SUBJECTS
CAN WE DO THAT
YEAH
YES THAT'S RIGHT
I JUST WANNA KNOW IT WORKS THE WAY YOU EXPECT IT TO WORK
THIS IS NOT A A GESTURE OF MISTRUST
THIS IS JUST EXPERIENCE THAT UM IF ANYTHING CAN SCREW UP IT WILL
I I'M TRYING TO CHOOSE MY LANGUAGE CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE'RE BEING RECORDED
BUT YOU'LL HEAR MORE CHOICE LANGUAGE AT THE POINT WHEN WE'VE ALL DONE A LOT OF WORK AND AND THEN WE DISCOVER WE CAN'T USE THE SESSION BECAUSE OF SOME THING WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
RIGHT
UM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
AND THEN THEN WE COMBINE
YEAH
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH MENTIONING THIS TO THE TO THE GUYS IN THE GARAGE IN TORONTO RIGHT
TO SAY MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
RIGHT
I THINK THAT'S A IF THE DOCUMENTATION SAID IT W COULD RECORD IN STEREO THEN I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO THEM ABOUT HOW THEY'VE DONE THIS
IS YOU'RE NOT SURE FROM THE DOCUMENTATION WHAT IT SAYS IT CAN DO
MM-HMM
RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY SO WHEN YOU I MEAN UH GIVEN THAT THERE ARE THESE EVENTS RECORDED
WE CAN USE ANY OF THEM AS THE BEGINNING OF ANY OF THEM AS A START POINT FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT
UM THERE ARE ALSO MOTIONS BEING RECORDED OF OBJECTS
RIGHT
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH
SO I'M RIGHT
UH THAT THAT THAT'S GREAT
I I'D BEFORE WE BREAK UP FOR LUNCH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THA THAT I KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA BE BEFORE WE'RE IN RUN MODE OKAY
SO THE SOUND THING THE SOUND THING IS STANDS IN OUR WAY WE NEED TO BE RECORDING SOUND ONLINE
OKAY
SO THAT'S A THING THAT HAS TO BE SOLVED
THE SHAPE THING IS SOLVED
MM-HMM
WE THINK
WE BELIEVE
RIGHT
SO THAT'S THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE DONE THIS WEEK
UM IN FACT LIKE TOMORROW FOR EXAMPLE
UM THE SHAPE ALL THE SHAPE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED
GENERATING SHAPES NO PROBLEM
UM SCORING SHAPE OVERLAP NO PROBLEM
NOTHING IS PROBLEM THERE
THERE ARE NO VISUAL DISPLAY PROBLEMS
MM-HMM
YEAH THEY HAD THEIR
THEY HAD THEIR INSPECTION LAST WEEK
UM J. P. STAGGERED AWAY FROM IT AND
AH
MM-HMM
OKAY
S
UM I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T HAD ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM SINCE
WELL HE'S PH HE'S PHYSICALLY HERE
IF WE WANT TO PAY HIM FOR SOME MORE TIME WE CAN DO THAT
WOULD THAT BE A JUST BETTER USE OF OUR TIME IN GET
YEAH
RIGHT
BUT M HE HE HE IS AROUND AND I BELIEVE
AND IF IF THE IF I IF IT'S A
RIGHT
BUT IF UM IF EVERYBODY HAS A LOT TO DO AND YOU KNOW
JOE COULD GIVE IT A COUPLE OF HOURS WHICH I IS WHAT IT MIGHT TAKE JUST TO FIX IT
THEN LET'S DO IT BECAUSE STARTING RUN TIME IS NOW GETTING TO BE FAIRLY URGENT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
RIGHT
BUT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T MAKE JOE DO THIS EC ALRIGHT
SO THERE'S UH SOME TRADE OFF BETWEEN AVAILABILITY AND SPEED FROM START TO FINISH GIVEN THAT THIS IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S CODE
SO YOU KNOW
RIGHT SO WE'RE WE'RE B WE'RE BUILDING MODELS
RIGHT
WE'RE WE UM
WE HAVE THE DESIGN SOMEWHERE
MM
HMM
WELL
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
I THINK SO
'CAUSE UM I HAVE TO CHECK BACK WITH
WITH J. P. FAIRLY SOON
OKAY HE WANTED TO KN UM
THE EIGHTEEN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTH PLAN GREAT
DELIVERABLES GREAT
PROGRESS WITH THE EXPERIMENT WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW
OKAY
SO WHAT DO WE THINK IF YOU HAVE A FAIRLY HECTIC WEEK ARE WE LOOKING FOR SUBJECTS NEXT WEEK
OKAY
ADS GO UP
YEAH I DO
I DO
BUT I THINK AD SHOULD PROBABLY GO UP THIS WEEK
WE WANT PEOPLE FOR N FOR NEXT WEEK
IS THAT OKAY
IS ANYBODY NOW TERRIFIED AT THE THOUGHT THAT WE'RE LIVE NEXT WEEK
THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING IN HERE ONE AFTER ANOTHER
OR P TWO TWO AFTER TWO MORE LIKELY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY IS THE IS THIS IS THIS GENERALISED IS THIS GENERALISED ANXIETY ROBIN
OR DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC THING THAT OKAY
SO ASIDE FROM THE USUAL ANGST WHICH WE ALL SUFFER WHEN WE GO LIVE
SO WE W WE WANNA DO SOME PILOTING AT THE END OF THE WEEK
RIGHT
OKAY
RIGHT
S
RIGHT
SHE'S USING BUT SHE'S ACTUALLY RELAXED THAT SOMEWHAT
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OSTENSIBLY BOOKED TIME WHICH ISN'T
OKAY
WE'VE BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE A SOLID BOOKING FOR ALL THE MORNINGS ANYWAY
RIGHT
AND L EXCEPT BY PERMISSION OF US ALRIGHT
WE OWN IT
UM SO WE CAN CHANGE THAT
I MEAN THEY EVERYBODY ACKNOWLEDGED THE THE OTHER WEEK THAT WE THAT WE HAD PRIORITY
OH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
OH YEAH YEAH
OH YEAH YEAH
DON'T WORRY
UM THERE'S THERE'S A BOOKING SYSTEM RIGHT
SO IT'S PUBLIC WHAT'S BOOKED AND WHAT ISN'T
OKAY
NO
ALRIGHT MAYBE W SHOULD GET ON THERE AND BOOK MORNINGS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
ALRIGHT
UH-HUH
YEAH JUST A WELL WE THINK WE SPOKE TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WHO USED THOSE FACILITIES THE OTHER DAY
BUT WE COULD BE WRONG
SO
HUH
RIGHT
UM WELL THE TWO KEY HOLDERS ARE HERE
OH I SEE
FROM CAROLINE
OR THE GENERAL OFFICE
THE GENERAL OFFICE
I SEE
BUT NO THEY NEED A THEY NEED AN ACCOUNT ON THIS MACHINE TO ACTUALLY TO USE IT
THEY NEED ACCOUNT ON THESE MACHINES SO THAT THEY COULD BOOK
THEY COULDN'T ACTUALLY LOG IN
MM-HMM
OKAY
WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON A WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT THE MATIN THAT THE MACHINES RETURN TO ZERO STATE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN YOU COME OFF THEM
BECAUSE THE IT'S THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEAVING VAR UM WELL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEAVING VARIOUS BITS OF WHO KNOWS WHAT AROUND ON THEM
RIGHT WHICH WHICH WE THINK IS WHAT'S CRITICAL
OKAY
UM PILOTING PILOTING PILOTING
YOU HAVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THE THINGS
WE HAVE TO TRY THE MACHI TH THINGS
WE HAVE TO CHECK THEM WITH MARLOES AND J. P. THAT THEY LIKE THE REPRESENTATION THE VARIABLES RIGHT
HOW ABOUT UH YOU HAVE ANY TIME ON FRIDAY
I GET A EMAIL BACK
MAYBE YOU AND I SHOULD BE THE PILOT SUBJECTS
FIRST PILOT SUBJECTS THE ONES WHO UM KNOW WHICH QUESTIONS WE WANNA ASK
AND THEN WE SHOULD GET ANOTHER PAIR WHO ARE NAIVE TO THE WHOLE THING
OKAY
THIS IS GENERALISED FLOATING ANXIETY
NO NO
IT'S IT'S IT'S WISDOM
BUT YEAH
WELL UM BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE CAN I MEAN UH YOU KNOW IF WE MAKE COMMENTS THEY FEED BACK IN A LO INTO THE DEVELOPMENT
UH FIVE HUNDRED HERTZ THOUGH
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH M M I UH I YEAH BUT THE P SORT OF START AND END TIMES WILL GIVE YOU BACK TO THAT OUTPUT
A AS A AND THEN YOU JUST MEASURE IT AGAINST YOU KNOW THE C THE C YEAH THE CUMULATIVE TOTAL TIME RECORD OR SOMETHING
SO
MM-HMM
B UH UH M YEAH SO I'LL I'LL LAG IN SOME OF IT DURING THE I SUPPOSE THERE'S THE THE SACCADIC MOVEMENT ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE
TH TH TH YEAH
THE IT SHOULD STILL COME OUT THAT THE LITTLE SKETCH I ASKED THIS P FOR FOR LAST WEEK ABOUT N. X. T. AND WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE THAT SORT OF TIERED EFFECT SO YOU COULD SEE THE OVERLAP OF WHERE ONE PERSON IS LOOKING COMPARED TO THE OTHER AND THEIR MOUSE MOVEMENTS AND THINGS
THAT THAT SHOULD RA UH ADDRESS ALL THAT
MM-HMM
BUT BUT BECAUSE IT'S ALSO IN THE I BASED ON THE THE TIME COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BASICALLY GET THE SCAN PATH OF THE PATTERN OF EVENTS FROM THAT AS WELL
YEAH YEAH
SO I DID HAVE IT SOMEWHERE
I DIDN'T HAVE IT R UH HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT
TRYING TO REMEMBER IT
MM-HMM
THE
UH IT M IT M UH BUT UH BR AT THAT POINT THEY'RE ALL OF IT LUMPED ALL THE INDIVIDUAL FIXATIONS AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T MOVE OFF THAT TRIANGLE TOGETHER AS A TOTAL SORT OF GAZE GAZE TIME ON THAT
YEP
YEAH
THAT THAT'S A TARGET WITHIN THE TARGET REGION
UH M
UH-HUH
M YES SOMEWHERE
MM-HMM
IT IT SH YEAH IT I MEAN UH AS LONG AS WE'RE DIF R YEAH IT THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANYTHING MISSING
THAT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEP
M M YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
YES
SO WE YEAH
SO WE IF WE HAVE AN AN EVENT YEAH THAT THAT YEAH THE SECOND LINE THEN FOR THE SECOND BEFORE IT
AND THEN WE CAN JUST TAKE THAT CHUNK OUT AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT
THAT SHOULD I I
RIGHT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
UH WELL IF IT'S JUST BASED ON UH LIKE A A STABLE FIXATION FOR SO LONG OR OR SOMETHING AND CROSSING INTO THAT REGION
YEAH
YEP
MM-HMM
YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM YEAH
TO MM-HMM
DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
MORE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL HE'S REALLY INTERESTED IN
MM-HMM
SO WHICH ONE DOES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT TO BE
BUT WELL I DON'T KNOW
BUT W UH MM-HMM MM-HMM
YES UH-HUH YEAH
IT'S MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YOU CAN WE CAN ANNOUNCE NOW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL
UH BUT Y Y Y
YOU MEAN TO THE TAGS OF THE DATA W WITHIN IT
YEAH
SO SO THINGS LIKE FIXATION THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS A AND
BI UM YEAH WITH SOME SOME MEASURE OF THE SO WE COULD WORK OUT THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS THAT MADE AND THE AVERAGE FIXATION DURATION AS WELL
BECAUSE HAVING ST LONG STEADY FIXATIONS CAN BE INFORMATIVE
UM IF IF THEY'RE HOLDING THEIR IF THERE'S LESS DANCING AROUND THE UM THE COGNITIVE FOCUS TENDS TO BE IN ONE SORT OF PART
SO UH THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IF THEY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE SAME PART
IF THEY'RE LOOKING AROUND IT UH RATHER THAN JUST HOLDING THEIR GAZE STEADY OR UM AND LONGER ON IT
UH YEAH
IT YEAH IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY IT'S IT'S WORTH MM-HMM
UH NO I WOULDN'T WANT TO THROW OUT
PUT THE ACTUAL LOCATION
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I MEAN PRESUMABLY
UH IF WELL YES BUT THAT PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY TO GET OUT BECAUSE YOU'D THEN HAVE TO BREAK UP UH THE PARTS SOMEHOW
YEP
MM-HMM
UH IT IT YES IT CAN DO BUT IT'S ALSO LOOKING AT IT WITHIN THEIR THEIR OWN BEHAVIOUR TO SEE YEAH
UH TH W I I WOULD SAY JUST THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS
I MEAN IT COULD JUST BE YEAH THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEP
EXACTLY
SO
MM-HMM
I MEAN TO
IT YEAH
UH IF IF WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING THEN I SUPPOSE IT'S YOU CAN ALWAYS YES IT'S YOU'RE NOT THROWING ANYTHING AWAY THEN
OR
RIGHT
MM-HMM
UH BUT UH UH NUMBER UH WELL THE UH DURATION TIME AS WELL SOMEHOW
WHETHER IT'S THE AVERAGE ONE OR
OF THE FIXATION
WELL
THE THE AVERAGE SHOULD BE ALRIGHT UH TO WORK WITH
THE THE
UH WELL IF YOU'VE GOT THE NUMBER OF FIXATIONS IN THE AVERAGE TIME YOU CAN THEN JUST GENERATE IT
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
UH
AGAIN UH THAT THAT SHOULD BE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DERIVE THAT PRESUMABLY FROM
RIGHT
UH THAT IT CAN VARY A BIT DEPENDING ON THE CALIBRATION
BUT IF WE'RE BUILDING IN A SORT OF ERROR MARGIN UM IT IT WILL BE BASED ON PIXELS AROUND
BUT THERE'LL ALSO BE A MINIMUM ONE
'CAUSE I'M TRYING TO THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY THE SMALL THE ACTUAL MOUSE ICON IS SO SMALL
IT'LL NEED A SLIGHTLY LARGER UH JUST BECAUSE IF WHAT YOU HAVE I IS A SORT OF LARGER ERROR OR OF B ERROR MARGIN AROUND IT
UH NO
THE O THE OTHER PERSON'S GAZE POSITION AS WELL
MM-HMM
YEP
TREA TREATED THE SAME AS AS THE MOUSE SAY
YEP
MM-HMM
YES YEP
YES
SO IF THERE UH IF MM-HMM
YES
BUT NOT LOOKING AT THEIR INDIVIDUAL AND PR FACT THEY PROBABLY WILL AVOID LOOKING DIRECTLY
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE LOOKING DIRECTLY AT IT IT'S OBSCURING
THE THE PART
MM-HMM
YEAH MM-HMM
THE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THE M THE MOUSE THE GAZE AND THE PART ARE ALL LAYERED
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH UH IF WHEN THEY GET MOVED TOGETHER
MM-HMM
IT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
TWO OBJECTS CLOSE TOGETHER YOUR EYE GAZE CAN ACTUALLY BE LOOKING AT THE LEFT EDGE OF ONE AND THE RIGHT EDGE OF THE OTHER
AND THEY'RE SOR THEREFORE LOOKING AT TWO OBJECTS AT ONCE
SAYING THEY NEED SOME NEW PENS
NEW PENS
WHITE BOARD PENS
MM-HMM
UH UNLE UH BUT IT UH UNLESS WE JUST DEFINE IT AS THERE'S ONLY THEY'RE THEY ARE EXCLUSIVE
AND WHICH EVER AREA M HAS THE GREATEST OVERLAP IS WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT
WELL IT W IF IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR SORT OF EYE POSITION
AND IT'S IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE EXACTLY FIFTY PERCENT IN ONE OBJECT AND FIFTY PERCENT IN THE OTHER
UH
WELL I UH UH PUT THESE THINGS ON
YEAH
UH UH WHAT I'M I'M THINKING IS IF YOU'VE GOT SAY ONE OBJECT THERE AND RIGHT
YOU KNOW SO THIS IS
THANK YOU
UH PART ONE AND PART TWO
AND YOU'VE GOT THEY'RE SORT OF THEY'RE LOOKING
THERE
THEN THAT OVERLAP MEANS THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE TWO PIECES SIMULTANEOUSLY
BUT
YEAH UH JUST IF THIS IS THERE'S MORE OF IT UH YEAH I YES
UH THAT'S W UH THAT'S THAT'S A DECISION WE'LL UH UH UH I'M SAYING IS IF THEY'RE LOOKING IF MOST OF WHAT THEIR OVERLAP IS HERE THEN WE STICK WITH THAT ONE
UH THAT'S TH WE NO THAT BECAUSE UM THE GAZE POSITION WILL BE A SORT OF FUZZY AREA
IT WON'T JUST BE A PIXEL
IT'LL IT'LL BE AN ACTUAL LIKE CIRCLE AND AREA
YEAH
SO I I IT IT THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE W UH IT'S IT'S NOT JUST A SINGLE POINT
IT'S IT'S A IT'S A SORT OF LUMP TARGET
AND SO THERE'LL BE A BIT OF A A SORT UH SOME SORT OF OVERLAP OF TWO OBJECTS
OR B YEAH THEY COULD JUST BE OSCILLATING MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH I MEAN IF IF THEY ARE OSCILLATING THOUGH THEN THAT'S PRESUMABLY GOING TO ST CHANGE THE WEIGHT
SO YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO SEE THEM FLIPPING BETWEEN UH WHEN YOU DECIDE THEY'RE LOOKING THERE MM-HMM IF THEY'RE REALLY CLOSE YEAH
MM-HMM
H YES
HMM
THE YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH I IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A PROBLEM UH BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE PART OR A CONSTRUCT FORMING IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIXATION
SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUITE AS CLEAR IF YOU CAN'T CAN'T CHOP IT OFF
UH-HUH
AND THEN IT YES
AND IT BECOMES CONSTRUCT OR ASSEMBLY WHATEVER TWO
NO
YOU CAN BUILD SUB SUB ASSEMBLIES AND THEN LINK THE THE PART REALLY YEAH
I SO EACH
WAI W I TH UH
WHICH CONSTITUENT PARTS
CONSTRUCT
YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT
'CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DIS DEFINED
LOOKING AT AREAS WITHIN IT
HMM
UH W
THEY CAN'T REPLACE UH THE NEW PARTS ONLY APPEAR WHEN THE PREVIOUS ONE'S BROKEN
YES
THEY CA THEY CAN APPEAR WITHOUT THEM
YOU C
UH WITH SAME SHAPE BUT NOT THE SAME SHAPE AND COLOUR
UH SAME EYE
YEAH
YEP
WELL THAT'S WELL THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE AT THE MOMENT
UH
YES
SO THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS AT THE MOMENT
UH I JUST ASSUME THAT'S HOW NI NIJMEGEN HAD SET IT ALL UP
TH THAT'S THAT'S BACK TO UH TIM'S DAY
THEY ARE INDIVIDUAL UH YOU HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS FOR THE YEP
UNIQUE YEAH
YES
THE TAM TAMGRAMS ARE MUCH EASIER WHEN YOU CAN SEE
MM-HMM
YEP
IT IS JUST A CONSTRUCTION TASK RATHER THAN A PUZZLE
YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH YES
IT AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE D UH THERE ARE TWO I THINK TWO SMALL ONES AND TWO LARGE TRIANGLES
THEY'RE ACTUALLY THE SAME PHYSICAL SIZE AND SHAPE
AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE IN DIFFERENT COLOURS
THAT ALSO MEANS IN THE P NEW PARTS LIST THEY'RE THERE FOR YOU KNOW TWO V LARGE TRIANGLES AND TWO SMALL ONE SMALL ONES SAY
WHEREAS IN IN THE REVISED EDITION IF THEY WERE ALL JUST BLACK THERE'D ONLY BE ONE UH MOLD IN THE NEW PARTS
AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S HARD WIRED
IT JUST APPEARS SO
MM-HMM
THE POLYGON ONE POLYGON TWO WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE
MM MM-HMM
YEP
HMM
YEP SAME SAME PIECES
MM-HMM
NO SO THEY THEY CAN HAVE DIFFERENT UH NUTS THERE
W WELL NUTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT COLOURS
BUT SAME PART IN DIFFERENT COLOURS YEAH
NO WHAT I MEAN THERE'S MORE THAN THEY'RE MULTIPLE PIECES THAT LOOK THE SAME
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND THE EXTRA PARTS DON'T APPEAR
SO YOU CAN'T COLLECT THEM
YEAH
THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THEM THAT IT'S LIKE GREYED OUT
THEY REALLY VERY FAINT
SO YOU SEE THE MOLD IS THERE
BUT THEY DON'T COME FILLED UH UNTIL
YES
YES
I I IT APPEARS IN THE NEW P UH LIKE UH SUDDENLY THE TH TH THE NEW PART LIGHTS UP SORT OF THING AND IT'S THERE
YES
THEY HAVE TO BRING IT INTO PLAY
NO
NOPE
THAT YEAH
THAT THAT IS ONE THINK UNLIKE THE SAY THE BAUFIX OR ANYTHING
WE I ASSUME THE THE BAUFIX
THE THERE AREN'T ANY EXTRA PARTS
AND AT THE MOMENT THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T A ALLOW FOR THAT
YES
REPLACEMENT BUT NO SUPERFLUOUS SO YOU CAN'T HAVE A A STANDARD STOCK WITH EXTRA PARTS THAT IT'LL NEVER USE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
INTENTIONAL UM IN THE SENSE THAT THEY BREAK DELIBERATELY WHEN THEY BRING THEM INTO THE NEW PARTS
BUT THEY C YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THE TRASH CAN IDEA THAT THEY BRING A
YOU HAVE TO HOPE THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE AND ONE OF THEM SAYS SOMETHING
YOU C MM-HMM
UH THERE'S NO THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD TELL THAT JUST FROM THE THE RAW MOVEMENTS OR OR SOMETHING
MM YEP
YEAH
IT
I
ALTHOUGH
WHAT I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER IS IF THE PEOPLE DELIBERATELY BREAK THINGS BY MOVING TWO PIECES TOGETHER
THEY THEY DON'T BOTH BREAK
THEY BOTH THEY BOTH
MM-HMM
SO THE I INTENTIONAL THING IS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY BOTH CLICK ON THE SAME OBJECT AND IT BREAKS
NO THEY COULD JUST MAKE A MISTAKE OR SCREW UP YEAH
Y YEAH
BUT THAT'S BRINGING IN THE THE LANGUAGE THING AGAIN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH UH YES
AT THE THE PERCENTAGE SCORE
YEAH
SO OUR YES RATHER THAN THE NUMBER OF PENALTIES OR OR SOMETHING
NO THE THE SCORE W UH IS FINE
UH YE THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY IT'S WORKED OUT
BUT UH UH THE PROBLEM WAS UM TO DO WITH THE M THE P THEY HAD A RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE PIECE AND UH IT'S ALL TO S TO THE SYMMETRY OF THAT
SO AS LONG AS IT'S DEFINED FINE
YES
IT WASN'T IT WASN'T A BUG
IT IT IT WAS A
UH WELL
UH YES IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE DEFINED AND THE UH DUTCH LOT DIDN'T
SO THAT WAS IT WAS ACTUALLY THEIR THEIR FAULT
BUT UM IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH IN THE DOCUMENTATION
YEAH
YEAH
BUT I IT IT IS QUITE FUNDAMENTAL AND UH CAUSES QUITE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT
YEP EXACTLY
YEAH
OR OH WE'RE WELL WE YEAH
WE SHOULD SHOULD GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING
THE UM CAMTASIA WAS TESTED LAST WEEK AND INITIALLY WE WERE A BIT WORRIED BECAUSE UH IN THE OLD VERSION IT SEEMED TO INTERFERE WITH IT
BUT UH WHEN YOU WHEN CRAIG RE COMPILED IT AND DID HIS NEW VERSION IT STARTED WOR WOR IT SEEMS TO WORK FINE
UM
NOTHING WE CAN TELL
NO UH
MM-HMM
NO
YES
THERE WILL NOW HAVE TO BE TWO CAMTASIA RECORDS BECAUSE UH E EACH PERSON ACTUALLY SEES A DIFFERENT SCREEN BECAUSE OF THE GAZE FEEDBACK
THEY DON'T SEE THEIR OWN GAZE TO THE OTHER PERSON
SO THERE'LL NEED TO BE TWO SEPARATE CAMTASIA VIDEOS GENERATED
HOPEFULLY WE WON'T
YOU MEAN OFFICIALLY
OR UH
YEAH I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE I WAS ASSUMING WE'D JUST GET ONE AND ONE LICENCE BOTH OF US
SUPPOSE TECHNICALLY WE SHOULD HAVE TWO BECAUSE IT'LL BE TWO MACHINES
I SUSPECT THAT IT WILL
IT'LL BE PER MACHINE I WOULD THINK
HMM
I I'LL HAVE A UH YEAH I'LL HAVE A L A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL CAMTASIA LICENCE
UM THE OTHER THING WE'RE WE
IT 'CAUSE IT'S NOW TWICE TWICE THE SIZE OF A
UH MM
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL THE OTHER PROBLEM IS UH CAMTASIA HAS TO BE MANUALLY LAUNCHED ON BOTH MACHINES SEPARATELY
YEAH
UH DURING THE TASK THERE IS A FLASH AND A BLEEP
OH I MEAN NOT DURING THE TASK
UH BEFORE
FOR EACH TASK
YES
YES
UH CAMTASIA Y YEAH
BUT
NO THEY'RE THEY'RE ON TWO S THE TWO SEPARATE MACHINES AND THE YOU YOU START AND END THEM SEPARATELY
THE THEY THEY'RE NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER
THEY'RE JUST RECORDING
YOU START IT RECORDING AND IT STARTS RECORDING WHAT'S ON ONE SCREEN
AND YOU START THE OTHER RECORDING ON THE OTHER MACHINE
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE TOTALLY SEPARATE
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER ONE
MM-HMM
YEP
YES
UH YEAH
SEE HOW HOW LONG IT TOOK THEM ACTUALLY
THAT'S THAT'S TRUE
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THEM TO CALIBRATE
OR YEAH
HOW MANY T HOW MANY TIMES BEFORE UH THE VALIDATION WORKED OR SOMETHING
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
I UH
WELL IT AT THE MOMENT THE THAT'S WHAT I WAS ASSUMING ON ON ON DOING THAT UH IT'S DONE FIRST
MM-HMM
YOU GO BACK AND ACTUALLY YES THEY WERE CRAP
ISN'T THAT THE ANSWER
YEAH
UM YES
THE OTHER THING WE WERE GETTING SORTED OUT WAS THE THE MICROPHONES
'CAUSE ONLY ONE OF THE UH CAMTASIA VIDEOS WILL ACTUALLY HAVE THE SOUNDTRACK
UH WE'RE JUST GETTING WE'VE GOT ONE CABLE AND TO THE TWO MICS
I SUPPOSE WE CAN DO IT IS IT WOULD IT BE WORTH SPLITTING IT
UH YEAH
SO THE AT AT AT THE MOMENT IT'S INS WELL
WHAT WE'VE FINALLY JUST UH AT TWELVE O'CLOCK TODAY LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT IT SUSSED UM IS TO GET ONE CHANNEL ONE MICROPHONE BEING THE LEFT CHANNEL AND ONE BEING THE RIGHT CHANNEL TO MERGE INTO A STEREO SINGLE FILE
UH UNFORTUNATELY THE ON ONE MACHINE
THE DISPLAY P. C. S
YEAH THE CAMTASIA V VIDEO
OR M M MULTI MEDIA THING
YEAH
YES
IT IT'S
YEP
IT'S CAMTASIA THAT'S RECORDING IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO SO M SO I ASSUME THAT WELL ONCE YOU'VE THAT SORT OF INFORMATION YOU WELL YOU GOT THE G. D. F. FORMAT
YOU THEN FILTER IT TO SAY RIGHT BETWEEN TIME X. AND TIME Y. THEY'RE THEY'RE CONSTRUCTING THAT HAVING TRIANGLE ONE TO THE CONSTRUCT
AND THEN YOU JUST SAY IN THAT TIME PERIOD WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE THEY LOOKING AT TRIANGLE ONE
WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE THEY LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT
DOES THAT SOUND DOES THAT SOUND REASONABLE
YEP
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH ALL ALL THE ALL EVENTS HAVE A START TIME AND AN END TIME
SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S GONNA CO THAT'S 'CAUSE B THE DIAGRAM WE GOT THERE SUGGESTING THAT THEY'RE ONLY LOOKING THING AT TIME
SO WHETHER IT'S TRIANGLE OR WHATEVER ELSE
BUT SO WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THERE IS THEY CAN BE LOOKING AT THE TRIANGLE AND MAYBE A MOUSE POINTER AND MAYBE AN EYE AT THE SAME TIME
OKAY OKAY
YEAH
YEP
YEAH YEAH
'CAUSE YOU GET C 'CAUSE YOU
YEP
YEAH
YEP
YEP YEP
OKAY YEAH
SO SO YEAH
SO SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF ADDING THESE THE TWO MOUSE POINTERS AND THE UM TWO GAZES AS EXTRA OBJECTS
UM SO YEAH
AS LONG AS AS LONG AS THEY'VE GOT AN I. D. IN THERE WE CAN JUST SAY RIGHT AT THIS P BETWEEN THESE TIMES THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT OBJECT OR THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE MOUSE
THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHATEVER
YEP
YEAH
PENS
I CONFUSE 'EM
YEAH
THAT WOULD
YEAH
YEAH
WELL THING IS THAT WITH
YEAH
YEAH
THING THING IS W. G. D. S. FORMATS IS WOR IS WORKING AT THE MOMENT
IT'S ACTUALLY GOT A SEPARATE TRACK FOR EACH PART
SO
YEAH
WELL THE
WELL THE THE THE IT DEPEN DEPENDS ON THE DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU BUILD IN
THERE'S DIFFERENT PARTS THERE'S DIFFERENT PARTS WHETHER YOU'RE DOING THE TAMGRAM OR WHETHER YOU'RE DOING AN AIRPA AIRPLANE OR WHATEVER
UM
BUT TH BUT SA BUT THING IS IF IF WE IF WE GOT IF WE GOT TRACKS FOR EACH FOR EACH PART WE CAN WE CAN EASILY ANALYSE IT DOWN LATER ON
YEAH
YEAH WELL THE
YEAH
YEAH
WELL THE THE THE THE DOESN'T REALLY LIST PART IN THE IN THE G. D. F.
UM SO YEAH
THAT THAT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
THERE SO THAT BAS BASICALLY WHAT I'VE GOT IS WELL THERE THERE THERE'S PLACES WHERE YOU GOT THE I. D. THOUGH
SO YOU'VE THE AN I. D. FOR A PART YOU GOT AN I. D. FOR A LOCATION ON THE SCREEN
SO IT SHOWS YOU THE TARGET CONFIG THE CLOCK WHATEVER ELSE
UM AND THEN WE CAN EASY ADD I. D. S FOR THE TWO MOUSE POINTS AND THE TWO GAZES
UM AND FROM THAT AND BA BASICALLY ALL ALL THE ALL THE TRACKS ARE DOING IS SAYING AT THIS BETWEEN THIS TIME THERE'S A LOOK AT THIS O THIS OBJECT
YEAH TH THIS I. D.
UM SO UH SO IT'S EFFECTIVELY A TRACK FOR EACH I. D.
THE TH YEAH THE BUT BUT
WELL WHA WHA WHAT HAPPEN WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS THAT THE THE TWO THE THE EXISTING PARTS BASICALLY CEASE TO EXIST AND A NEW PART WITH A NEW I. D. STARTS EXISTING AT THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE JOINED
YEP
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
OH
YEAH
YEAH THAT THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE WAY HE'S WORKING THE MOMENT
BECAUSE IT UH TH IT'S IT'S GENERATING A NEW I. D. WHEN YOU C WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW PART
UM
YEAH
UM YEAH
BUT THERE THERE'S THERE'S JOINT EVENTS
SO IF THE IF A JOINT EVENT IF IF IF IT'S THERE'S JOINT EVENT LINKED TO LINKED TO THE ITEM THEN YOU KNOW IT'S BECOME PART OF A CONSTRUCT
UM OF UM
YEAH THE THE THE YEAH
THE CON THE CON THE CONSTRUCTS ARE ALREADY TAGGED WITH THAT
SO THAT I'M ACT THERE'S ACTUALLY A S A SEPARATE FILE OF THE DATA FORMAT WHICH SAYS FOR EACH CONSTRUCT
WHICH WHICH TWO PARTS MADE IT MADE THAT CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT CONSTRUCT
YEAH
BUT YOU CAN STILL TA YOU CAN STILL TRACK WHAT PARTS WENT INTO IT
SO YOU CAN STILL FIND TRIANGLE ONE WHATEVER
YEAH
YEAH
BUT BUT THAT'S EASY N UH IT'S EASY TO DO BECAUSE THE THE CO EACH CONSTRUCT HAS THE I. D. S FOR THE PA THE THINGS THAT CONSTRUCT IT
YEAH
YEAH
WELL WE'LL D YEAH WELL WITH THE YEAH D WELL THING IS THAT WE WE STILL HAVE THE X. WA THE X. WAVE TRACES FROM THE ASCII FORMATS
SO IF IF YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY I'M LOOKING AT A SQUARE INSTEAD OF I'M LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCT
THAT'S IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THAT DATA OUT
UM IT'S IT'S YEAH
IT'S IT'S NOT DOING IT'S NOT DOING IT IN THE GEST ANALYZER AT THE MOMENT
BUT I CAN EASILY ADD IT TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION IF YOU WANT
YEAH IF IF YOU TAKE IT IF YOU T IF YOU CREA IF YOU CREATE A NEW PART IT UH IT GETS A NEW I. D.
SO IF YOU GET IF YOU DRAG A NEW PART OUT OF THE PARTS BIN
UH
YEAH I MEAN THE WE E
YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW WHI YOU KNOW WHICH WAY THEY MATCH
SO YOU CAN
YEAH THE
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
SO YEAH
YEAH SO I THINK THAT ANYTHING'S LOADING
THERE'S THERE'S THEN TWO TRIANGLE ISN'T THERE
THERE'S TWO IDENTICAL TRIANGLES IN THE TAMGRAM
UM
WELL YEAH YEAH
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SPECIFY THE MOLDS IN THE IN THE IN THE P THE FILE THAT C THAT GENERATES THE PARTS LIKE A LIST OF PARTS
THE MOLDS ARE BAS JUST TAKEN OUT OF THE THE FILE THAT GENERATE THAT SPECIFIES THE PARTS
SO SO HO HOWEVER MANY PART HOWEVER MANY MO HOWEVER MANY PARTS THERE ARE IN THE FILE THAT'S HOW MANY PARTS APPEAR IN THE IN THE PARTS BOX
IF YOU HAVE FIVE BLACK TRIANGLES GONNA BE FIVE FIVE PARTS IN THE FI FIVE BLACK BLACK TRIANGLES IN THE PARTS BOX
BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WELL IF IN THE IN THE INITIAL CONFIGURATION YOU CAN RE USE A TRIANGLE
SO IF YOU SO IF YOU ONLY WANT ONE BLACK TRIANGLE
YOU JUST CREATE ONE BLACK TRIANGLE IN THE PARTS BOX AND THEN RE USE THAT PA THAT TRIANGLE FIVE TIMES IN THE CONFIGURATION
YEP
YEP
WELL WHEN THE WHEN THE F WHEN THE FINAL CONSTRUCT THE THE WAY THE THE WAY THE THE CONSTRUCTS ARE DEFINED IN THE FILE
YOU'VE GOT LIKE YOUR P YOUR PARENT CONSTRUCT AND THE PARTS THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTED OUT OF
UM AND YEAH AS I SAY THE
YEAH YEAH
SO YOU GOT PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP AND I THE CHILD CAN BE A PART OR IT CAN BE ANOTHER CONSTRUCT
YEAH YEAH
'CAUSE UH THERE'S A JOINT ACTION
THE RESULT THE T WHAT YOU NEED FOR A JOIN ACTION YOU NEED TO YEAH A CONSTRUCT AND A PART TWO PARTS WHATE WHATEVER YOU'RE TAKING TOGETHER
AND THEN THE RESULT OF THAT IS A CONSTRUCT
YOU'VE GOT TIME WHEN THAT HAPPENS
YOU CAN SEE THAT CONSTRUCT APPEARED AT THAT TIME
UM AND YOU CAN STILL TRACK THE CHILDREN OF THAT CONSTRUCT
YEP
YEAH
YEAH WELL BY BY THE BY THE TIME BY THE TIME THEY'RE DOING THAT THEY MUST HAVE ALREADY BROKEN SOMETHING
SO YOU'LL SO YOU'LL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE REPLACING
SO
UH THEY DO
IF IF IF WHAT IF ONE IF ONE PERSON'S TRYING TO GET A PART TO A PART THAT ISN'T THAT THAT SO THE PART THAT'S JUST SITTING ON THE SCREEN THAT'S NOT BEING TOUCHED
THEY BOTH BREAK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH WELL YEAH
'CAUSE YEAH
C 'CAUSE IT WAS THROUGH THE ROTATIONAL PART
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN I'M
I'VE TH I'VE YEAH
IT'S IT'S IN THE DOCUMENTATION
BUT IT'S LIKE TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY DOWN A QUITE A LONG PAGE
SO
YEP
BUT UM
YEAH
YEAH
NO
NO THE THE THE THERE'S THERE'S VERY SMALL GRAPHICAL BUGS
BUT IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BIG THING
IT'S LIKE COUPLE OF WHITE PIXELS UH IN THE COURSE OF A IN THE COURSE OF A THE COURSE OF A TASK
SO IT'S THERE'S DISTRACTING
NO
YEAH BUT THEN THE QUE THE QUE THE QUESTION IS THERE A LICENCE FOR CAMTASIA WHERE YOU JUST NEED ONE EDITING C THING AND TWO RECORDING THINGS
'CAUSE YEAH THE R THE RECORDING YEAH THE RECORDING THI PRO PROGRAM IS JUST QUITE A IT'S QUITE A SMALL PROGRAM
THEY JUST GEN IT JUST GENERATES THE VIDEO AND SO I DON'T KNOW DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH HAVING A LOOK AT THE LICENSING FOR THAT JUST TO SEE
YEAH
YEP
MM
YEAH
NO YOU GOT YOU
YEAH YOU GOT EXACTLY THE SAME ACCESS TO SOUND QUALITY AS YOU GOT FROM ANYTHI ANYTHING ELSE ON THE WINDOWS
SO YOU CAN YOU DECIDE WHATEVER QUALITY YOU WANT
SO GOT A BIT OF
UH YEAH
BECAUSE THE THE SYNCHRONIZATION THE AUDIO AND VI THE AUDIO VISUAL SYNCHRONISATION COMES AT A SPECIFIC POINT IN THE EYE TRACK FILE
NO IT'S YEAH TH IT'S I I STA STAMPED INTO IT
SO IT'S JUST AFTER JUST AFTER IT PRINTS THE LINE STARTING EXPERIMENT UH UH YEAH
I'LL I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S JUST YEAH
YEP
UH WELL THE WELL THE MATLAB SCRIPT UH BAS JUST SA UH JUST SAYS UH YEAH
GI GI GIVES YOU THE TIMES OF THE AUDIO BEEP IN THE S IN THE SIGNAL
SO I JUST
YEAH
YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH
PRETTY CONFIDENT
BUT YOU YOU'VE YOU'VE SEEN THEM
IT IT WAS IT WAS
YEAH
YEAH I DON'T SEE HIM WITH TEN HE KILOHERTZ
YEAH
YEAH THE THE THE THERE'S A SIGNAL AT THE START AND THE END OF EVERY TRIAL
SO
YEP
YEP
YES IT'S A STEREO JACK
IT'S A STEREO JACK
BUT IT'S A MONO BUT IT'S A MONO UH MICROPHONE
MONO MONO RECORDING ON MICROPHONES
LINE IN
UH SP GOING GOING THROUGH A LINE IN
SO IT'S A SO IT'S A LIT SO IT'S QUIETER BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS THOUGH IT'S NOT POWERED
BUT IT'S STILL THINK YEAH
WE WE STILL PICK UP A SIGNAL
YEAH
YEAH
WELL THE THE WHEN THEY ARE THEY ARE THE THE THEY HAVE BATTERIES IN THEM
BUT I THERE'S NOT DOESN'T
BUT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE POWERED BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE LINE IN INPUT'S SO LOW
THE SO THE SOUND THE SOUND THE S
WELL THE YEAH THE THE YEAH THE THE THE THE JACK THAT IS THAT IT'S PLUGGED INTO IS STEREO
BUT WHEN YOU PLUG IN WHEN IT'S RECORDING FROM MICROPHONE IT RECORDS IN MONO
AND YEAH
A NEW SOUND CARD IS FIXABLE
YEAH
ALS THINK WE WE HAVE A WELL I SUPPO I SUPPOSE IT WELL ONE TH ONE THING YOU DO IS UH RE IS RECORD THE SOU SPEECH SIGNAL SEPARATELY FOR EACH FOR EACH PERSON
BUT THEN YOU'D HAVE TO PULL THE TWO PULL THE TWO SOUNDS TOGETHER
SO IF UH SO IF I I IF EACH MACHINE RECORDED ITS OWN WITH A RECORDED THE RECORDED LIKE THE THE P TH THE UH THE USER ON THAT ONE
YEAH
YEAH
OH THEY YEAH
AND THEN THE SO THE YEAH
SO TH
YEAH IT'S EASY
EASY
IF IF NOTHING IF NOTHING ELSE YOU H UH IF NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO IT IN A MATLAB SCRIPT
YOU JUST WRITE READ READ FILE ONE READ FILE TWO
AND THEN YOU JUST YEAH
YEAH BUT THEN THE THE THE MATLAB THE MATLAB SCRIPT WILL TELL YOU HOW L IT WILL TELL YOU HOW FAR APART THEY ARE
'CAUSE YOU CAN DO YOU CAN JUST MEASURE THE DRIFT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM
'CAUSE YOU GOT A L YOU GOT A LIST OF WHERE THE WHERE THE BEEPS ARE
AND THEN YOU SAY RIGHT THIS STREAM IS LIKE I DON'T KNOW NOUGHT POINT TWO FIVE SECONDS BEHIND THE OTHER ONE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO THEN
THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME SOUND CARD
SO YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
'CAUSE 'CAUSE 'CAUSE
YES
YEAH
SO THE THE EXTERNAL VERSION'S GOT PLUGS THAT SIZE AND THAT THAT IS STEREO MICROPHONES
BUT YEAH
THE OTHER ONE'S PLUG'S LIKE THE SMALLER SIZE AND THAT ISN'T STEREO
SO THE COLOUR THE COLOUR CAN DO IT
IT'S JUST THAT THE CONNECTORS ON THE THE CONNECTORS AT THE BACK OF THE COMPUTER CAN'T
YEAH
BUT AS AS FAR FAR AS WE CAN AND FIND THE THE WEB SITE OF THE YEAH THE THE CREATIVE LABS WEB SITE AND THE REVIEW OF IT
UM AND THEY WEREN'T ENTIRELY CLEAR
BUT THEY BOTH SUGGESTED THAT IT IS THERE IS A MONO THAT THERE THERE IS A MONO MICROPHONE
YEAH
YEAH I'M
YEAH
SO AND BASICALLY OUT THE OUTPUT THE G. D. F. IS JUST GONNA BE A WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS YOU KNOW WITH START AND END TIME
AND THE EVENT'S GONNA HAVE WHATEVER ALL WHATEVER THE OBJECT UH IS THAT'S BEING LOOKED AT AND THINGS
UM AND THEN YEAH AND THEN IT'S A MATTER OF WE'RE GONNA PUT WHATEVER FILTERS YOU NEED AFTER THAT
SO YOU CAN SAY RIGHT
I JUST WANT SO YOU CAN SAY FROM THE TIME WHERE THEY PICKED UP TRIANGLE ONE TO THE PART TIME IT BECAME PART OF THE ASSEMBLY
FIND OUT HOW IT'S HOW M PERCENTAGES OF TIME THEY WERE LOOKING AT IT OR WHATEVER
YEP
SO YEAH
SO YOU GOT MO YEAH
THERE THERE'S MOVE EVENTS
THERE'S LOOK EVENTS
THERE'S FIXATIONS AND BLINKS NOW AT THE MOMENT AS WELL
UM AND YEAH AND OH YEAH AND SEE UH LOOKS AT LOOKS AT OBJECTS AND LOOKS WHATEVER ELSE
SO UM S
YEP
YEP
YEAH
YEAH I WILL
YEP
YEP
OKAY
FAIR ENOUGH
OKAY
WELL YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
SO WE'LL WE'LL GET WE'LL GET THE GET THE AUDIO STUFF TESTED YOU KNOW SINGLE MICROPHONES
UM YEAH
GET THAT TESTED NEXT COUPLE DAYS AND I ASSU I ASSUME THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU NEED ME FOR T IN TERMS OF THAT
YOU DON'T YOU DON'T NEED ME INVOLVED IN THE PILOT DO YOU
SO WELL UNLE UNLESS UNLESS IT'S A BUG REPORT YEAH
I'LL W YEAH W I'LL I'LL I'LL B I'LL BE AROUND
BUT YEAH I'LL MAKE SURE
BUT HO HOPEFULLY IT WILL RUN SMOOTHLY AND YEAH I CAN RELAX
SO
HI I'M DAVID AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
UM I JUST GOT THE PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WHAT THE PROJECT IS
DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S ABOUT IT DIDN'T GET ANYTHING ELSE
DID YOU GET THE SAME THING
COOL
THERE'S TOO MUCH GEAR
OKAY
CAN'T DRAW
UM
YEAH
UM WELL ANYWAY I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST THE FIRST ANIMAL I CAN THINK OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
UM
YES
BIG REASON IS 'CAUSE I'M ALLERGIC TO MOST ANIMALS
ALLERGIC TO ANIMAL FUR SO UM FISH WAS A NATURAL CHOICE
UM YEAH AND I KIND OF LIKE WHALES
THEY COME IN AND GO EAT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT
AND THEY'RE QUITE HARMLESS AND MILD AND INTERESTING
TAIL'S A BIT BIG I THINK
IT'S AN AFTER DINNER DOG THEN
HMM
IT DOES MAKE SENSE FROM MAYBE THE DESIGN POINT OF VIEW 'CAUSE YOU HAVE MORE COMPLICATED CHARACTERS LIKE EUROPEAN LANGUAGES THEN YOU NEED MORE BUTTONS
SO POSSIBLY
HMM
YEAH
AND YOU KEEP LOSING THEM
FINDING THEM IS REALLY A PAIN YOU KNOW
I MEAN IT'S USUALLY QUITE SMALL OR WHEN YOU WANT IT RIGHT IT SLIPPED BEHIND THE COUCH OR IT'S KICKED UNDER THE TABLE
YOU KNOW
YEP
MM-HMM
I THINK ONE FACTOR WOULD BE PRODUCTION COST
BECAUSE THERE'S A CAP THERE SO UM DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU CAN CRAM INTO THAT PRICE
UM
I THINK THAT THAT'S THE MAIN FACTOR
COOL
OKAY
RIGHT
UM WELL THIS IS THE KICK OFF MEETING FOR OUR OUR PROJECT
UM AND UM THIS IS JUST WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES
UM SO FIRST OF ALL JUST TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER I'M LAURA AND I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER
DO YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF AGAIN
OKAY
GREAT
OKAY
UM SO WE'RE DESIGNING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND UM OH I HAVE TO RECORD WHO'S HERE ACTUALLY
SO THAT'S DAVID ANDREW AND CRAIG ISN'T IT
AND YOU ALL ARRIVED ON TIME
UM YEAH SO DES UH DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UM AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
UM SO THAT'S KIND OF OUR OUR BRIEF AS IT WERE
UM AND SO THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT STAGES TO THE DESIGN
UM I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED UM IN YOUR EMAILS
WHAT DID YOU GET
MM-HMM
IS THAT WHAT EVERYBODY GOT
OKAY
UM
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE INDIVIDUAL WORK AND THEN A MEETING ABOUT IT
AND REPEAT THAT PROCESS THREE TIMES
UM AND AT THIS POINT WE GET TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD OVER THERE
UM
SO UH YOU GET TO DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND SUM UP YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF IT
SO WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST
VERY GOOD
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
LOVELY
RIGHT
YOU CAN TAKE AS LONG OVER THIS AS YOU LIKE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT AN AWFUL LOT TO DISCUSS
OK OH WE DO WE DO
DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN A RUSH ANYWAY
ACH WHY NOT WE MIGHT HAVE TO GET YOU UP AGAIN THEN
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MINE IS
I'M GONNA HAVE TO THINK ON THE SPOT NOW
IS THAT A WHALE
AH
OKAY
GOD I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA WRITE ABOUT
UM
I WAS GONNA CHOOSE A DOG AS WELL
BUT I'LL JUST DRAW A DIFFERENT KIND OF DOG
M MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS MY OWN DOG AT HOME
UM
THAT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE HIM ACTUALLY
HE LOOKS MORE LIKE A PIG ACTUALLY
AH WELL
DO YOU
OH THAT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU
UH
UM HE'S A MIXTURE OF UH VARIOUS THINGS
UM AND WHAT DO I LIKE ABOUT HIM UM THAT'S JUST TO SUGGEST THAT HIS TAIL WAGS
UM HE'S VERY FRIENDLY AND CHEERY AND ALWAYS PLEASED TO SEE YOU AND VERY KIND OF AFFECTIONATE AND UM
UH AND HE'S QUITE QUITE WEE AS WELL SO YOU KNOW HE CAN DOESN'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH SPACE
UM
AND UH AND HE DOES A FUNNY THING WHERE HE CHASES HIS TAIL AS WELL WHICH IS QUITE AMUSING SO
IT IS
I THINK IT IS
HE ONLY DOES IT AFTER HE'S HAD HIS DINNER AND UM HE'LL JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST GET UP AND START CHASING HIS TAIL 'ROUND THE LIVING ROOM
YEAH SO UH
YEAH MAYBE
MAYBE
RIGHT UM WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS
JUST DOWN HERE
YEAH
OKAY
UM WHAT ARE WE DOING NEXT
UH UM
OKAY UH WE NOW NEED TO DISCUSS THE PROJECT FINANCE
UM
SO ACCORDING TO THE BRIEF UM WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING THIS REMOTE CONTROL FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO UM AND WE'RE AIMING TO MAKE FIFTY MILLION EURO
UM SO WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING THIS ON AN INTERNATIONAL SCALE
AND UH WE DON'T WANT IT TO COST ANY MORE THAN UH TWELVE FIFTY EUROS SO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE SELLING PRICE
SURE
ALL TOGETHER
UM I DUNNO
I IMAGINE THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
I IMAGINE IT PROBABLY IS OUR SALE ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY UP TO THE
THE UM THE RETAILER TO UH SELL IT FOR WHATEVER PRICE THEY WANT
UM
BUT I I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN DO YOU THINK THE FACT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE SOLD INTERNATIONALLY WILL HAVE A BEARING ON HOW WE DESIGN IT AT ALL
THINK IT WILL
UM
HMM
OH YEAH REGIONS AND STUFF YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
WELL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL DO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE I SUPPOSE IT'S DEPENDS ON HOW COMPLICATED OUR REMOTE CONTROL IS
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
WHAT JUST LIKE IN TERMS OF LIKE THE WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY
LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY PEOPLE HAVE TO SPEND ON THINGS LIKE
AYE I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN YEAH
MARKETING
GOOD MARKETING THOUGHTS
OH GOSH I SHOULD BE WRITING ALL THIS DOWN
UM
MM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
LIKE HOW MUCH DOES YOU KNOW A REMOTE CONTROL COST
WELL TWENTY FIVE EURO I MEAN THAT'S UM
THAT'S ABOUT LIKE EIGHTEEN POUNDS OR SOMETHING ISN'T IT
OR NO IS IT AS MUCH AS THAT
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN POUNDS
UM I DUNNO I'VE NEVER BOUGHT A REMOTE CONTROL SO I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW GOOD A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WOULD GET YOU
UM
BUT YEAH I SUPPOSE IT HAS TO LOOK KIND OF COOL AND GIMMICKY
UM RIGHT OKAY
LET ME JUST SCOOT ON AHEAD HERE
OKAY
UM WELL D DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO UH TO THE FINANCE ISSUE AT ALL
THIN
NO ACTUALLY
THAT WOULD BE USEFUL THOUGH WOULDN'T IT IF YOU KNEW LIKE WHAT YOUR MONEY WOULD GET YOU NOW
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
OH
FIVE MINUTES TO END OF MEETING
OH OKAY
WE'RE A BIT BEHIND
YEAH
RIGHT SO DO YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE LIKE A MAIN DESIGN AIM OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL D YOU KNOW
DO YOUR YOUR SATELLITE AND YOUR REGULAR TELLY AND YOUR V. C. R. AND EVERYTHING
MM-HMM
YEAH
OR EVEN LIKE YOU KNOW NOTES ABOUT UM WHAT YOU WANNA WATCH
LIKE YOU MIGHT PUT IN THERE OH I WANT TO WATCH SUCH AND SUCH AND LOOK A OH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
SO EXTRA FUNCTIONALITIES
MM-HMM
HMM
UM OKAY UH I'D WEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WRAP UP PRETTY QUICKLY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES
UM I'LL JUST CHECK WE'VE NOTHING ELSE
OKAY
UM SO ANYTHING ELSE ANYBODY WANTS TO ADD ABOUT WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS THEY'VE USED
WHAT THEY WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE PART OF THIS NEW ONE AT ALL
YOU KEEP LOSING THEM
OKAY
YEAH
W YOU GET THOSE ONES WHERE YOU CAN IF YOU LIKE WHISTLE OR MAKE A REALLY HIGH PITCHED NOISE THEY BEEP
THERE I MEAN IS THAT SOMETHING WE'D WANT TO INCLUDE DO YOU THINK
DUNNO
OKAY MAYBE
MY GOODNESS
STILL FEELS QUITE PRIMITIVE
MAYBE LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN OR SOMETHING
OKAY
UH-HUH OKAY
WELL I GUESS THAT'S UP TO OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
IT LOOKS BETTER
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT WELL UM SO JUST TO WRAP UP THE NEXT MEETING'S GONNA BE IN THIRTY MINUTES
SO THAT'S ABOUT UM ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE BY MY WATCH
UM SO INBETWEEN NOW AND THEN UM AS THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL WORKING DESIGN OF IT SO Y YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE
UM FOR USER INTERFACE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS I GUESS THAT'S YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT'LL ACTUALLY DO
UM AND UH MARKETING EXECUTIVE
YOU'LL BE JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT ACTUALLY WHAT YOU KNOW
WHAT REQUIREMENTS IT HAS TO HAS TO FULFIL AND YOU'LL ALL GET INSTRUCTIONS EMAILED TO YOU I GUESS
UM
YEAH SO IT'S TH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN STAGE IS NEXT I GUESS
AND UH
AND THAT'S THE END OF THE MEETING
SO I GOT THAT LITTLE MESSAGE A LOT SOONER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD SO
MM-HMM
UH-HUH YEAH
TH
OKAY WELL JUST VERY QUICKLY 'CAUSE THIS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FINISH NOW
UM I GUESS THAT'S UP TO US I MEAN YOU PROBABLY WANT SOME KIND OF UNIQUE SELLING POINT OF IT SO UM YOU KNOW
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT OKAY WE'LL THAT'S THAT'S THE END OF THE MEETING THEN
UM
SO UH
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING
UM I'M CRAIG AND I'M USER INTERFACE
YEAH
WELL MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL WOULD BE A MONKEY
THEN THEY'RE SMALL CUTE AND FURRY AND UH WHEN PLANET OF THE APES BECOMES REAL I'M GONNA BE UP THERE WITH THEM
YEAH
I KNOW UM
MY PARENTS WENT OUT AND BOUGHT UM REMOTE CONTROLS BECAUSE UM THEY GOT FED UP OF HAVING FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS FOR EACH THINGS THE HOUSE
SO UM FOR THEM IT WAS JUST HOW MANY DEVICES CONTROL
UH
MM-HMM
GREAT
AND I'M ANDREW AND I'M UH OUR MARKETING
EXPERT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S IT
YEAH
I WILL GO
THAT'S FINE
ALRIGHT
SO
THIS ONE HERE RIGHT
OKAY
VERY NICE
ALRIGHT
MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
IS LIKE
A BEAGLE
UM CHARAC FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF IT
IS THAT RIGHT
UH RIGHT WELL BASICALLY UM HIGH PRIORITY FOR ANY ANIMAL FOR ME IS THAT THEY BE WILLING TO TAKE A LOT OF PHYSICAL AFFECTION FROM THEIR FAMILY
AND YEAH THAT THEY HAVE LOTS OF PERSONALITY AND UH BE FIT AND IN ROBUST GOOD HEALTH
SO THIS IS BLUE
BLUE BEAGLE
MY FAMILY'S BEAGLE
I COULDA TOLD YOU A WHOLE LOT MORE ABOUT BEAGLES
BOY LET ME TELL YOU
IMPRESSIONIST
ALRIGHT
MM
SUPERB SKETCH BY THE WAY
YEP
I SEE A DOG IN THERE
YEP
NOW I SEE A ROOSTER
WHAT KIND IS IT
IS HE AWARE THAT TH IT'S HIS OWN CHA TAIL HE'S CHASING
HMM
PROBABLY WHEN HE WAS LITTLE HE GOT LOTS OF ATTENTION FOR DOING IT AND HAS FOREVER BEEN CONDITIONED
'KAY
UM CAN WE JUST GO OVER THAT AGAIN
UH SO BAS AT TWEL ALRIGHT YEAH
OKAY
SO COST LIKE PRODUCTION COST IS TWELVE FIFTY BUT SELLING PRICE IS IS THAT WHOLESALE OR RETAIL
LIKE ON THE SHELF
OUR SALE OUR SALE ANYWAY
YEAH OKAY OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
YES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL RIGHT AWAY I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S UM TH TH UH LIKE WITH D. V. D. PLAYERS IF THERE ARE ZONES
UM F FREQUENCIES OR SOMETHING UM AS WELL AS UH CHARACTERS UM DIFFERENT UH KEYPAD STYLES AND S SYMBOLS
UM
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN A AND THEN AL THE OTHER THING INTERNATIONAL IS ON TOP OF THE PRICE
I'M THINKING
THE PRICE MIGHT MIGHT APPEAL TO A CERTAIN MARKET IN ONE REGION WHEREAS IN ANOTHER IT'LL BE DIFFERENT SO
JUST A CHARA JUST A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE
JUST
OR JUST LIKE BASIC PRODUCT PODI POSITIONING THE TWENTY FIVE EURO REMOTE CONTROL MIGHT BE A BIG HIT IN LONDON
MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BIG HIT IN GREECE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
YEP
RIGHT AWAY I'M MAKING SOME KIND OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT INFORMATION WE'RE GIVEN HERE THINKING
'KAY TRENDY PROBABLY MEANS SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST BASIC SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST STANDARD
UM
SO I'M WONDERING RIGHT AWAY IS SELLING TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS THAT SORT OF THE THI IS THIS GONNA TO BE LIKE THE PREMIUM PRODUCT KINDA THING OR
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
YEP
YEAH I'D SAY SO YEAH
NO
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON LIKE HOW THAT COMPARES TO OTHER
OTHER
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH INTERESTING THING ABOUT DISCUSSING UM PRODUCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL FOR ME IS THAT L AS YOU POINT OUT
I JUST DON'T THINK OF REMOTE CONTROLS AS SOMETHIN SOMETHING PEOPLE CONSCIOUSLY ASSESS IN THEIR PURCHASING HABITS
IT'S JUST LIKE GETTING SHOELACES WITH SHOES OR SOMETHING
IT JUST COMES ALONG
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
LIKE SO SORT OF LIKE HOW DO YOU I I MEAN ONE ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT WOULD BE
WELL THE PEOPLE PRODUCING TELEVISION SETS MAYBE THEY HAVE TO BUY REMOTE CONTROLS
OR ANOTHER WAY IS MAYBE PEOPLE WHO HAVE T. V. SETS ARE REALLY FED UP WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND THEY REALLY WANT A BETTER ONE OR SOMETHING
BUT
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY SO
RIGHT SO IN FUNCTION ONE OF THE PRIORITIES MIGHT BE TO COMBINE AS MANY USES
I THINK SO
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WELL LIKE UM MAYBE WHAT WE COULD USE IS A SORT OF LIKE A EXAMPLE OF A SUCCESSFUL OTHER PIECE TECHNOLOGY IS PALM PALM PILOTS
THEY'RE GONE FROM BEING JUST LIKE LITTLE SORT OF SCRIBBLE BOARDS TO CAMERAS M. P. THREE PLAYERS TELEPHONES
EVERYTHING AGENDA
SO LIKE I WONDER IF WE MIGHT ADD SOMETHING NEW TO THE TO THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SUCH AS THE LIGHTING IN YOUR HOUSE OR UM
YEAH YEAH
AN
YEAH
LIKE P PERSONALLY FOR ME AT HOME I'VE I'VE COMBINED THE UM THE AUDIO VIDEO OF MY TELEVISION SET AND MY D. V. D. PLAYER AND MY C. D. PLAYER
SO THEY W ALL WORK ACTUALLY FUNCTION TOGETHER BUT I HAVE DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS FOR EACH OF THEM
SO IT'S SORT OF IRONIC THAT THAT THEN THEY'RE IN THERE
UM
YOU KNOW THE SOUND AND EVERYTHING IT'S JUST ONE SYSTEM
BUT EACH ONE'S GOT ITS OWN LITTLE
PART
MM
MM
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S JUST REALLY GOOD ID
YEP
UH SURE
I REMEMBER WHEN THE FIRST REMOTE CONTROL MY MY FAMILY HAD WAS ON A CABLE
ACTUALLY HAD A CABLE BETWEEN IT AND THE T. V. AND BIG LIKE BUTTONS THAT SORT OF LIKE LIKE ON A BLENDER OR SOMETHING
AND UM YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE NOW IT'S BETTER BUT ACTUALLY IT'S STILL KIND OF
I DUNNO LIKE A MASSIVE JUNKY THING ON THE TABLE
MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT HOW COULD BE MORE YOU KNOW STREAMLINED
S
SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
OR WHATEVER WOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY REASONABLE
'CAUSE IT COULD B IT COULD IT COULD BE THAT F IT COULD BE THAT FUNCTIONALLY THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER
BUT THAT JUST THE APPEAL OF OF NOT HAVING YOU KNOW
THESE DAYS THERE'S A R PE THINGS IN PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE LIKE CHIC YOU KNOW
UM NICER MATERIALS AND MIGHT BE
BE WORTH EXPLORING ANYWAY
OKAY
UM
BEFORE WE WRAP UP JUST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE HERE UM
DO WE WE WERE GIVEN SORT OF AN EXAMPLE OF A COFFEE MACHINE OR SOMETHING RIGHT
WELL
UM
ARE WE AT MA RIGHT NOW ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT OUR TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL MAY HAVE FEATURES WHICH GO BEYOND THE TELEVISION
OR ARE WE KEEPING SORT OF LIKE A A DESIGN COMMITMENT TO TELEVISION FEATURES
I I DON'T KNOW
YEP
YEAH SURE
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
MM YEAH
NOPE WE'RE ALL SET
WHICH WHICH IS THE CLUNKY ONE THE ONE ON LEFT OR ON THE RIGHT
OKAY
NO
I'LL ADD IT LATER I GUESS THE PRESENTATION
NO
NO
UM FUNCTION F. EIGHT
FUNCTION THE BLUE BUTTON
NEXT TO THE CONTROL ON THE LEFT
YEAH
YOU HAVE TO PUSH IT TOGETHER
YEP
NOPE
TRY THAT AGAIN
WAIT
YEP THERE WE GO
INCREASE THAT 'CAUSE WE CAN'T SEE THE
THAT'S MUCH BETTER
THERE YOU GO
BOUNCING ON TOP
IS INSTALLING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE
UM I THINK IT'LL BE THE MID RANGE TO THE HIGH END MARKET IN TERMS OF PEOPLE
'CAUSE TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR A REMOTE HOW MUCH IS THAT LO LOCALLY IN POUNDS
IS THAT TOO IS THAT A LOT OF MONEY TO BUY AN EXTRA REMOTE OR A REPLACEMENT REMOTE
RIGHT
UM SO MAYBE NOT THE HIGH END RANGE BUT MAYBE MIDDLE MIDDLE UP ISH
KIND OF
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I DUNNO I GUESS YOU PAY WHAT TEN TEN QUID FOR A REMOTE
LIKE A SIMPLE REPLACEMENT RIGHT
I MEAN IF YOU LOST YOUR REMOTE AND THE FIRST THING YOU JUST WANNA GO OUT AND GET WOULD YOU HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY
YEAH
YEP
I I THINK TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE IS IS IS FAIR TO ADD THAT IN AS A GROUP AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S MORE THAN HALF YOUR GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO AT LEAST TRY AND USE YOUR TECHNOLOGY
YEAH
I THINK PERHAPS THAT AGE GROUP IS SIGNIFICANT AS WELL BECAUSE THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO USE THE COMPUTER
WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR WITH COMPUTERS IN IN THEIR EVERYDAY WORK
I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE ABOUT I WOULDN'T SAY THIRTY FIVE
BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT FORTY ISH AND ABOVE NOW WOULD NOT BE SO DEPENDENT AND RELIANT ON A COMPUTER OR A MOBILE PHONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GADGETY RIGHT
PEOPLE WHO ARE U GROWING UP USED TO YOU KNOW IN SCHOOLS AND IN UNIVERSITIES
WHEN YOU GO ON TO THEIR WORKING LIVES PEOPLE WHO WOULD YOU KNOW REGULAR YEAH
YEAH
MM
I I THINK ONE THING WE SHOULD TRY NOT TO AVOID IS NOT TO SAY WE HAVE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE UM BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE GO Y EVERYBODY'S SAYING RIGHT YOU WANT SOMETHING SIMPLE
YOU WANT BASIC STUFF AND YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S EASY TO USE
SPEECH RECOGNITION MIGHT NOT BE THE SIMPLEST THING FOR SOMEBODY TO USE
UM BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO LOCK OURSELVES INTO A S PARTICULAR KIND OF TECHNOLOGY
RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON ON EXACTLY WHAT ARE THE FEATURES THAT WE'RE GONNA SAY AND THEN
YOU KNOW SAY SPEECH RECOGNITION IS GOOD FOR THIS SPEECH RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD FOR THIS
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD I SUGGEST THAT WE THINK ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION ANYWAY IT'S A IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USED TO FULFIL A FUNCTION
BUT AT END OF THE DAY WE DON'T LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY BUT WE LOOK AT THE FUNCTION FIRST
OKAY SURE
SORRY DO YOU MIND PASSING ME MY NOTEPAD
THANKS
COOL UM
OKAY
UM
WELL THIS IS JUST THE WORKING DESIGN UM
WELL THIS IS JUST WHAT HOW I WOULD GO ABOUT IT
UM I GUESS I TRY TO DEFINE LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW TRY TO DEFINE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET DONE
UM I THINK IN A PRACTICAL WAY WE KIND OF KNOW WHAT IT IS
WE'VE USED IT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT BUT WE'RE WE CAN'T N WE HAVEN'T NARROWED DOWN UM EXACTLY WHAT THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO FULFIL
LIKE BESIDES THE BASICS I THINK BACK IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS WE KNOW WHAT THE BASICS ARE
HAS TO CHANGE CHANNELS HAS TO CHANGE VOLUME BUT IN LIKE SPECIFICS RIGHT WHICH ONE OF THE BASICS ARE YOU TRYING TO TARGET
UM ARE THERE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BASICS THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT OR LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE BASICS
UM AND I JUST THE IDEA IS JUST TO GET EVERYBODY TO UM I USUALLY HAVE A HAVE HAVE A DESIGN THAT'S THERE AS A BASIC
SO YOU KNOW THINGS THAT TO START EVERYTHING GOING
BUT I GUESS EVERYBODY DOES HAVE SOME IDEA SO I DON'T THINK UM THERE'S A NEED FOR THAT
UM OKAY THIS FINDING THINGS IS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING SO I'LL GO INTO THE DIAGRAM FIRST
IT JUST EXPLAINS HOW THE PROCESS GOES THROUGH FROM A FROM THE BASIC TECHNOLOGY POINT OF VIEW
THE BASIC STEPS THAT YOU NEED UM IN THE DIAGRAM AND IN THIS SLIDE PROBABLY WORKS BETTER
UM OKAY YOU NEED SOME POWER SOURCE
'KAY A BATTERY OR SOMETHING TO KEEP IT GOING
UM AND THAT POWER SOURCE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT TIES YOU DOWN TO UM HOW LONG THE DEVICE WILL LAST
UM IT TIES YOU DOWN PERHAPS A BIT LATER ON IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGIES UM HOW FAR YOU CAN TRANSMIT THE SIGNAL OR THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU WANT
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE VOICE RECOGNITION RIGHT
THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRAINED BECAUSE THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO POWER A MICROPHONE YOU MIGHT NEED TO POWER OTHER THINGS SO THAT'S ONE PERHAPS CONSTRAINT THERE
UM
TH OKAY THE BASIC THING IS THERE'S A USER INTERFACE WHERE PEOPLE PUNCH A BUTTON OR TALK INTO IT OR SMILE TO IT OR BLINK THEIR EYES WHATEVER
YOU KNOW AND THAT UM PICKS UP AN INPUT FROM A USER
UM UH A LOGIC A SERIES OF LOGIC HAS TO DECIDE WHAT THE USER IS TELLING THE DEVICE
AND THE DEVICE HAS TO R YOU KNOW BASED ON YOU PUSH BUTTON A. SO I WILL DO SOMETHING WITH BUTTON A.
SO MAYBE BUTTON A. IS THE POWER BUTTON OKAY
UM AND THEN IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SEND THE SIGNAL OUT TO THE DEVICE ITSELF WHICH IS THE RECEIVER HERE
UM AND I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF MY DESIGN UM
IT'S FAIRLY GENERAL UM AND I GUESS THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS ALSO NOT TO RESTRICT YOU IN IN THE WAY YOU'RE THINKING LIKE UM VOICE RECOGNITION
RIGHT UM IF IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS IMPORTANT THEN WE JUST ADD MORE POWER RATHER THAN HAVING A THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER
SO IT'S NOT REALLY A CONSTRAINT IN THAT SENSE BUT I MEAN THESE ARE FUNCTIONALLY YOU KNOW THE BASE WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS TO DO
UM SO I GUESS THE REST OF IT I THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE YOU YOU WANNA GO BACK TO WHAT THE FUNCTIONS ARE
I THINK THAT'S MORE RELEVANT TO A DISCUSSION
YEAH W I'M DONE
MORE OR LESS
YEAH
PS OH IT'S JUST PUTTING THE REST OF IT INTO WORDS BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING
UM YOU HAVE A TRANSMITTER AN INPUT DEVICE LOGIC CHIP YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE THAT
UM
I GUESS THIS WOULD BE
YEP
UM THESE THESE AREN'T TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS IN THAT SENSE
THIS IS JUST UM A BASIC PRINCIPLES AND BASIC COMPONENTS THAT ARE NEEDED
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU NEEDED UM IF YOU NEEDED TO ADD UH A VOICE RECOGNITION RIGHT
THEN YOUR USER INTERFACE WOULD BE SPLIT BROKEN DOWN INTO MORE COMPONENTS RIGHT WHICH YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE THE V. R. AND STUFF LIKE THAT
UH
YEP
YEP
SO EACH COMPONENT REPRESENTS ONE FUNCTION BUT I THINK THE BASIC FUNCTIONS ARE THE LOGIC THE TRANSMITTER
UM AND THE RECEIVER OKAY AND THE POWER ARE THINGS THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT
UM AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT BASED ON WHAT YOUR USER INTERFACE REQUIRES THEN WE'LL ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITY TO IT
UM THERE MIGHT BE ONE OTHER CONSIDERATION WHICH WOULD BE THAT THE THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. FOR EXAMPLE
OKAY UM ARE WE GONNA RESTRICT OURSELVES TO USING THE TRADITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES OF INFRA RED THING
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY BE PHYSICALLY BE POINTING TO
RIGHT
YEP
THERE MIGHT BE ONE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION UM IN PARTICULAR RIGHT NOW SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION
UM IF SOMEBODY'S GONNA H TALK TO THE DEVICE YOU IDEALLY WANT THEM TO HOLD IT TO THEM
I IT YOU MAY NOT REQUIRE THAT BUT YOU KNOW UM IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING VERY NATURAL I GUESS
YOU KNOW TO HOLD IT TO SIGNAL TO THE USER AND PUSH A BUTTON MAYBE TO START S TALKING ABOUT IT
THEN YOU NEED TO SEND THE SIGNAL OUT SO BECAUSE IF YOU'RE USING INFRA RED THE LINE OF SIGHT UM SAY THE T. V. 'S AT THAT CHAIR
AND I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF HERE AND THE TRANSMITTER IS HERE IT BLOCKS IT
SO IN THAT SENSE THERE'S NOT REALLY A RESTRICTION BUT IT'S SOMETHING WHICH YOU MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT LATER ON IN THE PROCESS
NOT SO MUCH FURTHER DOWN
THERE'S THERE'S NOT MUCH SPECIFIC SPECIFIC INFORMATION BUT I THINK THAT UM ONE INDICATION OF INFRA RED MEAN THAT YOU'RE JUST TARGETING TRADITIONAL DEVICES
BECAUSE INFRA RED IS SOMETHING WHICH EVERYBODY HAS
THERE'S A THERE'S OKAY FROM FROM A FROM A COMPONENT POINT OF VIEW THERE'S ADDED COMPLEXITY
AND YOU ADD COST TO IT UM AND THEN THERE'S PROBABLY THE FACT THAT YOU NEED ANOTHER PHYSICAL COMPONENT
YOU NEED A DOCKING CRADLE FOR EXAMPLE FOR YOU TO PUT IT IN TO CHARGE
OR YOU NEED TO GET THE USER TO PLUG IT IN
UM AND MOST USERS ARE VERY F USE ALREADY USED TO THE IDEA OF BUYING BATTERIES AND PUTTING IT INTO THE CONTROLLER
BUT UNLESS THE CONTROLLER'S GONNA CONSUME A LOT OF BATTERIES LIKE HE'S GONNA RUN THROUGH LIKE TWENTY BATTERIES A MONTH
THEN I DON'T THINK RECHARGEABLE IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED TO CARE ABOUT
UM
OKAY I THINK
ANOTHER THING THAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT CATEGORISING THE CONTROLS
UM MAYBE I COULD SUGGEST WE WE BREAK THEM DOWN INTO THREE SIMPLE CATEGORIES
ONE WOULD BE AUDIO CONTROLS ONE WOULD BE VIDEO CONTROLS AND THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE A DEVICE
UM THIS MAY NOT MAP VERY WELL TO ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY ESPECIALLY BUT I THINK THAT UM FROM A MANUFACTURER'S POINT OF VIEW FROM A PERSON DESIGNING THE DEVICE
BUT I THINK FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF A PERSON USING THE DEVICE YOU KNOW A T. V. IS SOMETHING THEY SEE AND SOMETHING THEY HEAR
UM IT'S SOMETHING THEY DO OTHER THINGS TO LIKE TURN IT ON AND TURN IT OFF
I MEAN LIKE SO WHAT WE COULD HAVE IS LIKE THREE BUCKETS RIGHT WHERE WE COULD THROW THINGS INTO LIKE IF WE WANT THIS FEATURE
LET'S THROW IT INTO THERE AND THEN FROM THERE DECIDE WHETHER IT'S BASIC OR IT'S NON BASIC
I MEAN IT MIGHT HELP WITH THE VISUALISATION
AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP WITH THE COMPONENT BUILD AS WELL
MM NO NOT REALLY
MM
UM THINGS LIKE ON OFF
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU SEE
I ME MEAN IN TERMS OF PICTURE AND THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE YOU KNOW UM SO UM AND CHANNEL
BECAUSE THE ON OFF ALSO GOES YOU KNOW LIKE ON OFF LIKE POWER NOT ON OFF SOUND
NOT ON OFF VIDEO
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T TURN OFF THE VIDEO ON YOUR T. V.
BUT UM YOU MIGHT WANNA YOU KNOW TURN OFF THE SOUND SAY YOU WANNA PICK UP THE PHONE THERE'S A MUTE BUTTON RIGHT
SO YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF PUTTING IT ON TO UM OTHERS OR A DEVICE
DEVICE IS BASICALLY ANYTHING WHICH WE CAN'T CATEGORISE RIGHT
WE PUT IT OUT
YEAH ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU HEAR RIGHT
YOU YOU PUT THAT INTO AUDIO
AND THEN VIDEO IS ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN SEE
UM
YEP
YEP
YEP
LIKE RANDOM WHICH WE HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO PUT BUT WE NEED IT SOMEWHERE THERE
UM EVEN EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MAP VERY CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPLE AT LEAST HAVE SOME IN THEIR MIND
IT'S EASY TO USE
I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT UM AND I GUESS FROM THE COMPONENT POINT OF VIEW IT'S EASY TO BUILD AS WELL 'CAUSE THINGS ARE LIKE FIXED
IS THAT ALRIGHT NOW
OKAY
SORRY
OKAY EVERYBODY ALL SET TO START THE MEETING
OKAY WE'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR FOR THIS ONE UM TO UH DISCUSS THE UM FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
ALL READY TO GO
OKAY
UM SO HOPEFULLY YOU'VE ALL BEEN WORKING AWAY AND I'VE PUT THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
UM SO I GUESS JUST TO TO RECAP ON UH WHAT WE DID LAST TIME
UM KIND OF UH GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT AND UH GOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE EQUIPMENT AND STARTED TO DISCUSS UM A BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT
YOU KNOW COST WISE HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAD TO S
UM JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE THREE NEW REQUIREMENTS
UM WHICH IS THE THE FIRST ONE IS THAT UM UH THE COMPANY'S DECIDED THAT TELETEXT IS OUTDATED UH BECAUSE OF HOW POPULAR THE INTERNET IS
NOBODY USES TELETEXT VERY MUCH ANYMORE SO WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER THAT IN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM THEY'VE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT WE UM WE ONLY USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO CONTROL THE TELEVISION NOT THE V. C. R. D. V. D. OR ANYTHING ELSE
I THINK THE WORRY IS THAT IF THE PROJECT BECOMES TOO COMPLEX THEN IT'LL AFFECT UM HOW LONG IT TAKES US TO GET IT INTO INTO PRODUCTION
THE TIME TO MARKET
SO UM WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP IT SIMPLE AND IT'LL JUST CONTROL THE T. V.
AND THE OTHER THING WAS THAT THE COMPANY WANT THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN
UM I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE CORPORATE COLOUR IS
IT MIGHT BE YELLOW BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF YELLOW EVERYWHERE
WELL THAT'S THE THING I'M I'M NOT SURE UM
UH TH BECAUSE ON THE THE COMPANY WEBSITE UH WHAT DOES IT SAY
UH SOMETHING
YEAH I MEAN DO THEY IS THAT SOMETHING THEY WANT ACTUALLY WRITTEN ON IT 'CAUSE IT'S QUITE LONG
UM OR YEAH JUST THE IDEA BUT I'M NOT SURE
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS AS WELL
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS JUST NOT TO WORRY ABOUT TELETEXT UH ONLY CONTROL THE T. V.
AND UM AND UH INCORPORATE THE UH COLOUR AND SLOGAN OF THE COMPANY
UM SO IS EVERYBODY OKAY WITH ANY OF THAT OR DO YOU WANT ME TO RECAP AT ALL
RIGHT UM TIME FOR PRESENTATIONS THEN
WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST
OKAY COOL
OH YEAH OF COURSE YEAH
G GO ON AHEAD
MM-HMM
OKAY
ALRIGHT
OOP
UM
WELL WE CAN CHAT AWAY FOR UH FOR FIVE MINUTES OR SO I THINK AT AT MOST
JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES ANYWAY
MM-HMM
SHALL WE SH WELL WE'LL STICK TO KIND OF YOUR AREA FOR NOW
YEAH
LOOKS KIND OF YEAH
WELL I THINK IT'S A VALID POINT
I MEAN LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT LOOKS QUITE UM QUITE COMPLICATED AND THAT P. R. T. P P. R. O. T. THING IS INCREDIBLY CONFUSING
UM SO I SEE I SEE WHY YO YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT PREFER THE SIMPLER DESIGN BUT YEAH YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE OUT ON
YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES SO MAYBE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU GET A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE YOU KIND OF FLIP THE THING OPEN
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH AND THEN ACTUAL NUMBERS FOR CHANNELS AS WELL YEAH
GOD I WOU I WOULD SAY THAT'S REQUIRED
I MEAN THERE'S NO WAY ANYBODY'S GONNA BUY A REMOTE CONTROL THESE DAYS WHEN IF YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY INDIVIDUALLY SELECT CHANNELS I MEAN WOULD ANYBODY DISAGREE WITH THAT
UM WHAT ELSE UH SO DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT TELETEXT DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT V. C. R.
UH ANY KIND OF LIKE DISPLAY CONTROLS AT ALL DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST
MM
YEAH
I THINK ARE YOU ARE YOU MAYBE KIND OF THINKING WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE AND WHAT WOULD BE NICE
MM-HMM
OKAY RIGHT
WELL DO YOU WANNA MAYBE JUST AT THIS POINT DECIDE ON WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE AS A P AS A FUNCTION OF THIS
UM SO SO FAR JUST TO RECAP YOU'VE GOT VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL AND
RIGHT OKAY
UM
MM-HMM YEAH
OKA
MM-HMM
OKAY
UH WELL JUST TO TO WRAP UP QUICKLY ON THIS THIS LITTLE SECTION HAVE I JUST LOST OH NO
UM UH DO YOU THINK MAYBE THAT'S THE ONLY KIND OF UH ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS
AND THEN MAYBE JUST THINGS THAT WOULD BE NICE IF IT COULD DO WOULD BE THINGS LIKE AUDIO SET UP AND DISPLAY SET UP AND THINGS LIKE THAT
MAYBE LIKE A MUTE BUTTON THAT SORT OF THING
ANY OF YOU ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT AT ALL
NO
OKAY RIGHT
UM OKAY IF WE CAN MOVE ON TO NEXT PRESENTATION THEN PLEASE
UM
DO YOU WANNA
PROBABLY NOT ACTUALLY
YEAH
BIT COMPLICATED
IT'D BE NICE IF EVERYTHING WAS WIRELESS WOULDN'T IT
RIGHT
OH LIKE OVERLAP BETWEEN WHAT YOU SAID
OH WELL FOR ALL YOU KNOW THAT THAT'LL HAPPEN
MM HARD TO KNOW WHAT WHERE YOUR ROLE ENDS YEAH
OKAY
UH PR YEAH PRESS FUNCTION AND F. EIGHT YEAH
MM
YEAH YOU WANNA
OH OH HERE WE GO
THERE YOU GO
UM
OKAY
RIGHT
CAN YOU UM
RIGHT OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD AND IS EASY TO USE BIG PRIORITIES
OKAY
MM
SO IT YOU WANNA GROUP ALL THE DIFFERENT KIND OF TYPES OF FUNCTIONS TOGETHER YOU KNOW
THAT'S I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
WELL UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON BY THE END OF THE MEETING IS WHO WE'RE GONNA BE UM WHO'S OUR OUR TARGET AUDIENCE
OUR TARGET MARKET
UM SO IF WE WANT SOMETHING THAT THAT LOOKS GOOD AND IS EASY TO USE
BUT HAS Y IS FAIRLY POWERFUL PRODUCT WHATEVER WHO DO WE REALLY WANT TO AIM THAT AT
I MEAN
YEAH WHO WOU WHO WOULD HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND
WELL I IF IF LIKE TWENTY FIVE EURO IS OUR IS OUR SELLING PRICE THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE
WELL I DON'T I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW MUCH THAT WILL RETAIL AT
BUT YOU WANT IT'S SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT GONNA JUST USE THE REMOTE THAT COMES WITH THEIR TELLY I SUPPOSE THEY'RE GONNA ACTUALLY GO OUT AND BUY ONE
SO WHO DO YOU THINK WE'RE AIMING THIS AT
IT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN POUNDS I THINK
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH SO DO YOU THINK WE'RE WE'RE AIMING AT A FAIRLY YOUNG MARKET THEN
YEAH OKAY
UM DO YOU THINK THEN UH VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY SERIOUSLY CONSIDER
WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK CRAIG
N YEAH
I THINK WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO NARROW IT DOWN TO SAY LET'S TARGET THESE PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT AND 'CAUSE YOU KNOW
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME KIND OF SELLING POINT TO IT
SO UM ANYBODY ANYTHING THERE TO ADD JUST KIND OF YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
UH TH LIKE IF WE ARE GOING TO INCLUDE SPEECH RECOGNITION IT'S KIND OF BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND THIRTY FIVE SEEMS TO BE LIKE A REALLY HIGH RESPONSE TO THAT
SO WE COULD SAY THAT WAS OUR TARGET
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY SO FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE LOOK FAIRLY YOUNG
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE BIT OF EXPENDABLE INCOME TO SPEND ON THIS SORT OF THING
YEAH
YEAH
SO
YEAH
YEAH
SO THEY'LL NOT SH NOT SHY AWAY FROM SOMETHING QUITE HIGH TECH
THAT THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD POINT
UM OKAY SO UM SO SHALL WE MAKE THE DECISION UH TO INCLUDE SPEECH RECOGNITION IF WE CAN
OKAY
WHY IS THAT
OKAY
WHERE YOU CAN ACTIVATE IT AND DEACTIVATE IT
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
UH-HUH
OKAY
UH OKAY
WELL DO YOU WANNA UM GIVE US YOUR PRESENTATION AND THEN THEN WE CAN I DON'T KNOW UM MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA TO ALL DELIVER OUR PRESENTATIONS AND THEN DISCUSS
BUT THIS IS THIS IS HOW WE'RE YEAH EXACTLY YEAH
OH IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST OCCURRED TO ME AS WELL IS IF WE MAKE IT UM SPEECH RECO IF WE INCORPORATE SPEECH RECOGNITION
THAT'S APPEALING TO PEOPLE UM MAYBE WITH A PHYSICAL DISABILITY AS WELL
UM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
REALLY
DO YOU THINK MAYBE WE NEED LIKE FURTHER ADVANCES IN THAT KIND OF AREA UNTIL IT'S WORTHWHILE INCORPORATING IT THOUGH
MM
COURSE NOT
THERE YOU GO
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
UH
WELL DO YOU WAN DO YOU WANNA FINISH UP YOUR YOUR WHOLE PRESENTATION THEN
ARE YOU ARE YOU ALL DONE
MM
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH
SO THIS JUST SHOW HOW WE'RE KIND OF MODULARISING THE WHOLE THING
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
WELL WELL A WORRY THAT WAS WAS EXPRESSED IN THE NEW REQUIREMENTS WAS THAT IF WE MADE THIS TOO COMPLEX IT WOULD E IT WOULD EFFECT UM HOW LONG HOW LONG IT TOOK US TO GET THIS TO MARKET
SO I TH SUSPECT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA JUST TO RESTRICT OUR KIND OF OUR CREATIVE INFLUENCE ON THIS ON THE USER INTERFACE AND NOT WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT UH HOW WE TRANSMIT IT UM BECAUSE I MEAN IT IT'S TRIED AND TESTED INTRA RED
SO WE COULD STAY WITH THA
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
YEAH MM-HMM
OKAY
MM
MM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
W
YEAH
W WELL WELL WE'VE UM IN THE NEW REQUIREMENT SPEC THEY SAID JUST TO FOCUS ON THE T. V. SO THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO FOR NOW I THINK
SOMETHING I WAS WONDERING ABOUT WAS THE POWER
UM IS IT WORTH CONSIDERING LIKE HAVING LIKE A CHARGING UNIT AS OPPOSED TO JUST REGULAR BATTERIES
I MEAN IS THAT SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO GO INTO DO YOU THINK OR SHOULD WE JUST CONSIDER RUNNING ON REGULAR BATTERIES
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY SO
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY SO JUST STICK TO TO REGULAR
OKAY
UM RIGHT
SO BASICALLY THE UM I'M JUST GONNA JUST RECAP UH WHAT I SAID AT THE START
WAS THAT UM THE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MEETING WAS TO F ABSOLUTELY FINALISE WHO WE'RE GONNA AIM THIS AT AND WHAT EXACTLY THE PRODUCT'S GONNA DO
SO UM JUST TO RECAP ON ARE WE ALL HAPPY ABOUT THE IDEA OF UM AIMING THE PRODUCT AT UM THE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BRACKET
UM AND ALSO THE FUNCT THE THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONS OF WHAT IT'S GONNA DO
DO YOU WANNA RECAP ON THAT CRAIG
OKAY RIGHT
OKAY
YEAH IT'S AS OPTIONAL FUNCTIONS
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY RIGHT
UM OKAY WELL I GOTTA KIND OF GOT FIVE MINUTES TO WRAP UP NOW
UM NEXT THING WE'RE DOING IS HAVING LUNCH
WHOOHOO
UM AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF WORKING ON THE NEXT STAGE
UM SO I'LL BE PUTTING THE MINUTES OF THIS UH THIS MEETING INTO THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER
UM SO UH I GUESS JUST TO JUST TO CONFIRM THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE NEXT WELL IN THE THIRTY MINUTES AFTER LUNCH ANYWAY
UM FOR UH OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER YOU'RE GONNA BE THINKING ABOUT THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
UM USER INTERFACE DESIGNER GONNA BE THINKING ABOUT OUR USER INTERFACE AND MARKETING YOU'RE GONNA BE THINKING ABOUT TREND WATCHING
UM AND YOU'LL ALL GET SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AS WELL
SO UM I DUNNO JUST JUST TO TO ASK NOW IF YOU'VE GOT ANYTHING ELSE YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT WHILE WE'VE BEEN TALKING
UM DO YOU WANNA START WITH DAVID
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY AT ALL
NO OKAY
ANDREW
YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD IDEA
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE UM AUDIO WHICH IS GONNA BE LIKE YOU KNOW YOUR BASS SETTINGS AND ACTUAL VOLUME HI OKAY
OKAY AND THEN VISUAL
OKAY SO BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN JUST ACTUAL DEVICE THINGS
LIKE WHAT CHANNEL YOU'RE WATCHING TURNING ON AN OFF STUFF LIKE THAT
OKAY UM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
UM SO YEAH I GUESS JUST THINGS TO THINK ABOUT ARE YOU KNOW LIKE THE FACT IT'S GOTTA LOOK GOOD
BECAUSE OF WHO WE'RE WE'RE YOU KNOW TARGETING THIS AT
UM SOMETHING MAYBE KIND OF QUIRKY IN DESIGN MAYBE
MAKE IT KIND OF ERGONOMIC KIND OF TO HOLD YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT
UM SO I GUESS I GUESS THAT'S IT
THAT'S THE MEETING OVER
WHOOHOO
I'LL GO FIRST
ALRIGHT UM CAN I ST STEAL THIS FROM THE BACK OF YOUR LAPTOP
UH
SO THIS IS THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
UM
RIGHT TO DO THE UM THE DESIGN I HAVE I'VE HAD A LOOK ONLINE
I'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE HOMEPAGE WHICH HAS GIVEN US UM SOME INSP INSPIRATION FROM PREVIOUS PRODUCTS
UM I'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS PRODUCTS TO SEE WHAT THEY OFFER AND UM I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU GUYS FOR UM YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THE DESIGN AT THE END OF THE MEETING
UM UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK OUTSIDE THE MEETING ROOM SO
UM HAVING A LOOK AT THE EXISTING PRODUCTS I FOUND OUT THAT UM IT TENDS TO COME IN SORT OF TWO EXTREMES
THERE'S EITHER UM A VERY COMPLICATED ONE THAT'S GOT LOTS OF BUTTONS LOTS OF COLOURS VERY CONFUSING YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
UM IN THAT CASE THE THE LABELLING TENDS TO BE VERY BAD
UM THERE'S AN EXAMPLE I'LL SHOW YOU AT THE END UM SH SHOW YOU NOW
UH
HERE UM THE BUTTON THERE AND THERE
THIS ONE'S PROG
SORRY
THAT ONE'S PERG AND THAT ONE'S PROG AND IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHAT IT DOES
UM NOT SURE IF YOU HAD A A LOOK AT THE OTHER UM CONTROL IN THAT EXAMPLE
UM IT'S A VERY SIMPLE ONE
IT'S GOT ONLY THE BASIC FUNCTIONS MM BUT UM IT'S THE SAME SIZE AS THE THE HARD TO USE ONE
UH IT LOOKED A BIT CLUNKY
THEY'RE VERY BIG AND NOT VERY MUCH USE FOR BUTTONS
UM AND IT'S JUST VERY HARD TO ACCESS THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING FOR INSTANCE FOR A SLOW MOTION BUTTON
UM MY OWN PREFERENCES I PREFER THE THE CLUNKY ONE
UM IT'S VERY EASY TO USE
UM BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES LACK THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS WHICH I I QUITE LIKE HAVING ON THE CONTROLS
UM SO I BELIEVE THE THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS SHOULD MAYBE BE HIDDEN IN A DRAWER OR SOMETHING LIKE THA FROM THE BOTTOM OF IT
SO NOW I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR YOUR PREFERENCES
UM NOT SURE OF HOW LONG WE'VE GOT UH
UM THE CLUNKY ONE IS THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
UM I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME SIZE BUT UM IT'S GOT MUCH FEWER BUTTONS
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S VERY SPREAD OUT AND KIND OF YOU KNOW I GET THE IDEA IT'D BE SORT OF ABOUT THIS SIZE
GOT VERY FEW BUTTONS ON IT AND
UM DO WE HAVE ANY FUNCTIONS THAT UM WE'D WANT ON IT
I MEAN SO FAR I'VE GOT UM ON AND OFF UM SWITCH THE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND PUT THE VOLUME UP AND DOWN
UM THEY'RE JUST THE THE VERY BASICS YOU COULD USE FOR A T. V.
OKAY
UM YOU SAY THAT'S A H A REQUIRED ONE OR A REQUESTED ONE
WOULD YOU LIKE UM THE CHANNELS LIKE THE THE NUMBERS ON THING UM
UM YEAH
UM
UH TO START WITH UM SORT OF A BIT BOTH
UM WE NEED TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE UM AND AFTER THAT WE CAN ADD THINGS IF THEY'RE POSSIBLE
THERE'S UM ON AND OFF UM VOLUME AND CHANNEL AND SKIP TO CERTAIN CHANNELS WITH THE NUMBERS
DO YOU WANT TO SWITCH PLACES
JUST JUST SWITCH THEM
THINK MAYBE THE THE WIRE IN THE BACK MIGHT BE LOOSE
UM
WELL DID YOU NOT SAY IT WAS THE THE ADULTS THAT WERE GOING FOR THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION
SORT OF THE THE OLDER GROUP
UH F
YEAH
I RECKON ONE PROBLEM WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION IS UM I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN ONE OF THEM USED AND UH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS IN THAT ONE WASN'T PARTICULARLY AMAZING
SO YOU END UP YELLING AT THE CONTROL FOR HOURS
CHANNEL UP
UM
I THINK IT'D PROBABLY QUITE EXPENSIVE TO PUT IN
UM
I THINK WE JUST SAY THAT IT WAS GONNA BE THE THE MOST BASIC STUFF POSSIBLE
UM ON OFF UP AND DOWN CHANNELS UP AND DOWN VOLUME AND UH SKIP TO A CHANNEL
TA
UM I THINK WE INCLUDE MUTE BUT APART FROM THAT UM I THINK WE JUST WE'LL GO FOR THE SIMPLENESS
YEAH
UM JUST ABOUT THE THREE BUCKETS UM WHAT WOULD GO IN THE THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS ONE
COULD YOU PLUG ME IN
OKAY
THANKS
OKAY
'KAY
OKAY
AND THE SLOGAN LIKE THE ACTUAL WRITTEN SLOGAN OR JUST TO EMBODY THE IDEA OF THE SLOGAN
'BOUT PUTTING THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
SURE
RIGHT
MM-HMM
M YEAH
LIKE A LOT OF A LOT OF WHAT I'VE UM READ AND PREPARED FOR THIS MEETING FITS IN REALLY CLOSELY WITH WHAT WITH WHAT CRAIG'S JUST GONE OVER
SO IN PART I COULD I COULD GIVE YOU SOME OF MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES BUT I COULD ALSO TH ADD SOME TO THIS WHICH IS JUST ABOUT SORT OF UM SORT OF MARKET RESEARCH
BUT ANYWAY UM WE MIGHT COME TO THAT LATER
UM CLUNKY IN WHAT SENSE LIKE UM H HEAVIER
LARGER
I SEE SO IT'S MORE JUST BASIC
RIGHT OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
SURE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WHICH WAS THAT
UP THE NUMBERS OR THE UP DOWN
YEAH
YEAH
WE DON'T
NO
YEAH
WELL I THINK I THINK ES ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE CATEGORISING
WE'RE SAYING WELL WE WANT THIS TO BE A PRODUCT THAT OFFERS ALL THE SORT OF MORE TRICKY FEATURES BUT WE WANT THEM TO BE IN ANOTHER AREA
IS THAT RIGHT
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE SORTING THEM AN OR ARE WE ACTUALLY ELIMINATING THINGS WE JUST DON'T WANT THE PRODUCT TO HAVE
YEAH
YEP
WELL ONE ONE WAY I WOULD LOOK AT THIS UM WOULD BE THAT WE A APPROACH THE DIFFERENT CONTROLS IN TERMS OF UM LIKE CONTROL TYPES
SO THAT FOR THE USER IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHERE THEY GO
UH AND ALSO THINK MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SORTA W W WHAT WOULD JUST WANNA BE ACC EASILY ACCESSIBLE
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD AUDIO CONTROLS THOSE COULD BE SOMETHING PEOPLE SET UP VERY RARELY
MAYBE THEY'RE UN THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE IN A LITTLE AREA BUT COVERED UP UM THINGS LIKE CHANNEL AND VOLUME UM ARE USED ALL THE TIME
SO WE JUST HAVE THEM RIGHT OUT ON TOP UM VERY JUST VERY SORT OF SELF EXPLANATORY
UM SO MAYBE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HAVING THREE OR MORE GROUPINGS OF CONTROLS
YOU KNOW LIKE ONE WHICH ARE JUST THE THE HABITUAL ONES THAT SHOULD BE RIGHT WITHIN YOUR NATURAL GRIP
AND OTHERS THAT ARE UH ALSO AVAILABLE AND THEN OTHERS THAT ARE CONCEALED
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
SURE
CAN THIS CAN THIS PL REACH
CAN THIS PLUG COME ACROSS
NO
SO WHY DON'T I JUST PICK UP AND MOVE THEN
HERE I'LL JUST
WHY DON'T I JUST
MM ER CAN YOU GO UP BEHIND ME
KINDA THIS IS SO THIS I'M ALL IN A KNOT NOW
OKAY
UM
SO I CAN I CAN SAY ALREADY
I DUNNO WHETHER THIS IS FOR GOOD OR FOR BAD BUT THERE'LL BE A LOT OF KIND OF UH REDUNDANCY IN THE IN THE THE ISSUES AND THE THE UH THE THINGS
YEAH YEAH
WHICH IS MA NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING
BUT MAY WHAT I'VE ALREADY STARTED DOING IS CR I CREATED A SLIDE IN IN MY PRESENTATION HERE SO UM SO THAT WE KIND OF THINK WELL WHAT'S THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF WHAT WE'VE TAKEN FROM YOUR IDEAS AND AND MINE
BECAUSE CERTAINLY I I HAVE A HARD TIME SEPARATING SEPARATING THINGS COMPLETELY
OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY WHAT YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME WHAT YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME IMPACTS A LOT ON WHAT UM LIKE MARKET RESEARCH MM THAT THAT I'VE BEEN SO HOW DO I HOW DO I GET THIS UP
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
SO
F. EIGHT
OH AND F. EIGHT
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY I THINK THAT THAT'S DOING IT NOW
UH AGAIN
OKAY
UM OKAY GREAT
OKAY
JUST UM BEFORE I BRING THIS UP WHAT I'LL JUST SAY IS UM WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE DONE IS TRIED TO COLLECT SOME INFORMATION SO THAT I CAN THEN RELAY THIS TO TO YOU GUYS SO THAT IT'S NOW BECOMES A COLLECTIVE THING
AND THEN KIND OF LEAD US IN THE DIRECTION OF DECIDING 'KAY WHAT WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS
WHAT SHOULD WE DECIDE AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
THAT WOULD BE
OKAY
SO UM DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
SO WHAT I BASICALLY GOT IS I JUST LOOKED INTO SOME INFORMATION AND SORT OF TH TRIED TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW WE COULD REVIEW IT AND HOW WE COULD AND WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS WE COULD TAKE AWAY FROM IT AND THEN MAYBE BY THE END OF JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE THINGS WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR PRIORITIES
'CAUSE CERTAINLY THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT INFORMATION TO GO THROUGH
SO UM I'M THINKING HERE ABOUT UH PRIMARILY ABOUT CUSTOMER NEEDS THAT WE START WITH THE CUSTOMER
AND W YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND WHAT ARE ISSUES WITH WITH UM EXISTING PRODUCTS
UH TO THINK ABOUT TRENDS AND ALSO ABOUT TRY AND CONNECT THAT AS YOU SEE WITH THE COMPANY VISION WHICH IS ABOUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
UM AND THEN AS I SAY UH W WE'D LIKE TO PRIORITISE OUR DESIGN FEATURES FROM THIS AND UM
DUNNO
OKAY
UM
SO THIS IS WHAT I'VE FOUND HERE UM A LOT OF THIS IS NEW TO ME SO WE'LL JUST READ THROUGH TOGETHER
UM USERS DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
SO THEY FIND THEM UGLY
MOST PEOPLE FIND THEM UGLY
UM THE VAST MAJORITY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY FOR IT TO LOOK FANCY AS WELL WE'LL SEE LATER
THE VAST MAJORITY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY FOR UM SLIGHTLY MORE INTUITIVE CONTROL SUCH AS VOICE RECOGNITION
OKAY I'M GONNA WE'LL LOOK AT THAT IN A SECOND
UM MOST PEOPLE USE ONLY A F A VERY SLIM PORTION OF ALL THE CONTROLS
SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS PEOPLE WANT THIS H TECHNOLOGY
THEY TEND TO USE THE MOST SIMPLE CONTROLS AND OVERALL THEY FIND REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE SOMETHING THEY DON'T DOESN'T REALLY APPEAL TO THEM
SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE LIKE IF FOR ME THIS IS SORTA LIKE THREE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM INSPIRATIONS
YOU KNOW ONE IS THAT WE WANT UH SOMETHING THAT'S HIGH TECH BUT WE WANT IT TO SEEM EASY
AND IN SPITE OF THE PRIMITIVE SIDE OF IT AND THE VERY HIGH TECH SIDE WE WANT IT TO JUST BE AN APPEALING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN PEOPLE'S HANDS
UM FRUSTRATIONS
THEY GET LOST A LOT S AS IT CAME UP IN OUR LAST MEETING
UM TAKES TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE THEM
THIS IS UH WHY I MENTION WHEN CRAIG WAS UH SHOWING US SOME IDEAS THAT WE ACTUALLY TRY AND GROUP CONTROLS
SO D IT DOESN'T JUST LOOK LIKE A BIG PANEL KINDA LIKE WHEN YOU YOU LOOK AT
YOU KNOW A NEW COMPUTER KEYBOARD OR SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE EXPLANATORY
IF YOU WANT AUDIO IF YOU WANT VISUAL THEN YOU HAVE THOSE
UM
AND I WILL ADMIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT R. S. I. STANDS FOR
UH NO THAT DID NOT COME UP AT ALL
UM SO HERE HERE IS ANOTHER UM SORT OF A A REVIEW HERE OF THE MAIN THINGS
I ALSO FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD UH ADULTS AT LEAST WOULD PAY MORE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION
NOW APPARENTLY WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE TECH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY IN REMOTE CONTROL
SO I DUNNO IF THAT'S POSSIBLE WE MIGHT CONSIDER GETTING INTO IT
UM
AND AND AGAIN HERE AS WE SORT OF MOVE M SORT OF THIN START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE WANNA SELL AND MARKET THIS
I THINK A RECURRING THEME HERE IS THE COMPANY WANTS IT TO BE WANTS US TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S FASHIONABLE AND SLEEK AND TRENDY
UM PEOPLE UH ADDITIONALLY AREN'T AREN'T LIKING THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR PRODUCTS
SO WE WANNA THINK ABOUT AS WE TAKE ALL THE SORT OF THE TECHIE FEATURES HOW WE CAN UM PUT THAT INTO A UNIT WHICH IS WHICH PEOPLE LIKE
YOU KNOW THEY LIKE THE AESTHETICS AND THE ERGONOMICS
YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU KNOW JUST C LOOKING AT WHAT WHAT CRAIG UM CRAIG'S I UH IDEAS ARE S SORTA TELL ME THAT MAYBE WHAT WE WANNA DO IS TRY AND UM SEPARATE THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE WANNA INCLUDE IN THIS
SO IF WE DO SAY WELL WE WANT THERE TO BE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WILL WE TRY AND MAKE THAT ALMOST BE LIKE OPTIONAL TECHNOLOGY
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE LIKE I FIND A LOT OF T. V. S THESE DAYS
SOMETHING REALLY LIKE ABOUT 'EM IS IF YOU WANNA JUST TURN 'EM ON AND OFF YOU CAN
BUT THEY HAVE LITTLE PANELS WHERE YOU CLICK AND THERE'S JUST LIKE TONS OF FEATURES YOU GO THROUGH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S S THAT'S SORT OF THE UM BUT I I'M MY HOPE HERE IS THAT I'M PUTTING OUT THIS INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN THEN SAY OKAY
WELL HOW DO WE COLLECTIVELY MOVE ON WITH IT
UM I I HAVEN'T BROUGHT OUT ONE SPECIFIC MARKETING IDEA
ALTHOUGH MY SENSE IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD TRY AND THINK ABOUT IS WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS IN MATERIALS AND SHAPES AND STYLES AND THEN USE THAT
BUT NOT LET THAT CONFINE US TECHNOLOGICALLY
SO
ALRIGHT
ANY UM COMMENTS ON ALL OF THAT
THAT'S UH
YEAH
OKAY
WHERE'S THE MONEY MAYBE
YEAH
AND WHO WATCHES T. V.
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
THIS THIS KINDA TOUCHES ON YOUR COMMENTS THERE DAVID
THESE ARE THE AGE GROUPS WHICH WE HAVE INFORMATION ON AND THESE ARE THIS IS A TABLE OF H WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY MORE FOR A CERTAIN FEATURE
JUST GIVES US A ROUGH IDEA OF WHERE THE W THE WILL TO SPEND MONEY ON T. V. EQUIPMENT IS
MOSTLY FOCUSED AROUND THE TWENTY FIVE AGE GROUP
SORT OF YOUNG PROFESSIONAL KIND OF
MM-HMM
UH YEAH IT'S THE
YEP
IT DOES IT DOES FIT WITH THE MARKET THAT WE'RE SORT OF IDENTIFYING IN TERMS OF
OKAY
YEAH
SURE
SURE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT YEAH
YEAH SURE
MM-HMM
YEAH
IF WE CAN
YEAH
RIGHT
COULD IT BE AN ON OFF THING
LIKE IF YOU WANT IT ON YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SURE
SURE
YEAH
SURE
YEAH
SURE
YEP
YEP
YEAH IT'S GOOD WELL IT'S GOOD TO GET IDEAS OUT WHILE THEY'RE FRESH IN MIND
UM
NOT
YEAH
AND NOT LOSING
AND ALSO IT HELPS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE NOT LOSING THIS YOU KNOW THEY THEY'RE SAYING OH IT'S I LOSE IT IN THE COUCH
LIKE WE'RE KIND OF WHAT WE'RE B SORT OF GETTING IN INTO HERE IS MATING DIFFERENT UH DESIGN FEATURES TOGETHER THAT THEY
RIGHT
OH REALLY YOU'VE SEEN ONE BEFORE
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
'KAY
SURE
SURE
YEP
RIGHT
AND LIKE ON THE MEANS B SINCE WE'RE ON THE TOPIC OF THE TECHNOLOGY UH ARE THERE ANY LIKE WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS
ALRIGHT WHAT'S WHAT I IN IS THIS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE GO ABOUT IT OR ARE THERE OTHER THIN
RIGHT
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF
'KAY
RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
AND UM JUST A CLARIFICATION BEFORE WE FINISH THIS
UH DOES C IS OUR CONTROLLER IS IT HAVE THE OPTION OF BEING UM ON A STANDARD UH FREQUENCY AS ALL OF THE OTHER EQUIPMENT
SO THAT THE ONE CONTROLLER CAN CONTROL SEVERAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT
OKAY
JUST TO T. V. OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S GOOD
AND IS IT GOING TO INCLUDE ANY OF THE UH THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES OR ARE WE GONNA ELIMINATE THOSE
OKAY
R IS IT IS IT IS IT S IS IT NOT AN OPTION STILL THAT WE INCLUDE SOME THINGS JUST AS A SORT OF UNDER LIKE SORT OF UNDER A DOOR OR SOME
'CAUSE WHAT WHAT I'M I'D BE A BIT WORRIED ABOUT IS IF SOMEONE WAS H HAD PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED HABITS OF EXPECTING TO CONTROL SURROUND SOUND OR THIS AND THAT WITH THEIR CONTROLLER AND THEN AND THEN THEY
YOU KNOW W THEY GET OURS AND W IT'S DOESN'T HAVE THAT
I DUNNO IF THAT'D BE A PROBLEM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
'KAY OKAY
LIKE THAT
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM OKAY GREAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM YEAH JUST I JUST WANTED TO ASK THEN BEFORE WE WRAP UP
SHALL WE AGREE FOR SAKE OF UM SORT OF CLARITY AND WHEN WE WHEN WE R RESUME THAT WE'LL U USE THIS IDEA DAVID'S PROPOSED
WHERE WE THINK OF THESE THREE SORT OF BUCKETS AND ANYTHING ANYTHING WE DISCUSS ABOUT THEM IS SORT OF OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS
SHALL WE DO THAT THEN
OKAY GREAT
AND AND CHANNEL
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
COLOUR YEAH
SURE
SURE
OKAY
AND THEN K I SUPPOSE QUITE LIKELY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IN THE D DEVICE CATEGORY THERE MIGHT BE SOME WHICH ARE JUST LIKE THE HABITUAL STANDARD AND THEN OTHERS WHICH ARE MAYBE A BIT MORE YEAH
SURE OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
GREAT
THEN WE GET TO GO FIND OUT WHAT WAS PICKED UP FOR LUNCH FOR US
'S TO DO NOW IS TO DECIDE HOW TO FULFIL WHAT YOUR STUFF IS SO IN THAT SENSE SO IT DOES KIND OF MAKE SENSE YEAH
YEP
YEP
YEP
MM-HMM
NO
YEP
MM-HMM
YEP
IT'S PROBABLY NOT SENDING
YEAH
YEP THERE IT IS
AND THE PLAY DOH 'S YELLOW
COOL
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY UM
OOPS
YEAH OKAY
LET ME JUST GET THIS GOING FIRST
AH THERE IT IS
'KAY THAT SHOULD BE IT
OKAY UM I GUESS THE SAME THING AGAIN I STARTED WITH SOMETHING VERY BASIC
SO JUST SO YOU GUYS HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT'S INVOLVED IN MY PROCESS
UM AND THEN YOU CAN JUST WORK THROUGH IT AND WE 'LL EITHER MODIFY IT OR START FROM SCRATCH UM DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE
UM THE COMPONENTS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME
UM I THINK LIKE WHAT YOU GUYS SAID UM THE MOST INPUT THAT'S NEEDED IS BASICALLY IN THE USER INTERFACE
THE REST OF THE COMPONENTS UM THEY DO HAVE AN IMPACT IN TERMS OF COST AND COMPLEXITY
UM LIKE YOU SAID TIME TO MARKET WAS A PROBLEM UM AND HOW MANY COMPONENTS ARE PHYSICALLY IN THERE IN COST
AND THE POWER IS BASICALLY A FACTOR OF THAT
UM AND THE LOWER COMPONENTS THE POWER THE LOGIC THE TRANSMITTER AND THE INFRARED UM THEY AFFECT YOU IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF YOUR DEVICE
UM AND THAT WOULD HAVE SOME INTE IMPACT ON HOW Y I THINK MORE HOW YOU HOLD RATHER THAN UM THE ACTUAL USE USING THE THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE UM LIKE WE'VE SAID WE'VE DEFINED
LIKE WE ONLY WANT THE BASIC THINGS THAT TO BE VISIBLE AND THE REST OF THEM WE TRY TO HIDE
SO UM YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WORKING OUT SPACE
SO I GUESS THREE THINGS UM COST UM COMPLEXITY AND THE SIZE
THESE ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT UM WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOU
SO JUST GO THROUGH IT IN THE COMPONENTS
UM THESE ARE THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU
UM I'M NOT VERY SURE ABOUT THE VOICE THING 'CAUSE I GOT ANOTHER EMAIL AND IT WAS IN FACT QUITE SKETCHY ON WHAT N THE VOICE OPTIONS ARE
UM IT SAID IT COULD TALK TO YOU BUT IT NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LISTEN
I IT SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A SENSOR BUT NEVER CLARIFIED THAT
SO MAYBE IF YOU WELL I COULD SEE THE OTHER EMAIL THAT THEY SENT YOU
UM 'CAUSE THEY GOT BACK TO ME WITH LIKE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS OR DIFFERENT OFFERINGS OF WHAT COMPONENTS AVAILA
OKAY SO YOUR BASIC COMPONENTS ARE BUTTONS OKAY AND YOU HAVE A WHEEL AVAILABLE LIKE A MOUSE SCROLL WHEEL
OKAY THERE'S AN L. C. D. DISPLAY UM I THINK THESE ARE QUITE STANDARD THINGS
NO UM THEY'RE WELL IN THE SENSE THAT THESE ARE ALL THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR YOU
I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU THE COMPLEXITY AND THE COST THING AGAIN A BIT LATER
OKAY UM THEN THERE'S UM HOW THE CASE ACTUALLY LOOKS
IT CAN ACTUALLY BE FLAT OR IT CAN BE CURVED
UM AND THEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIALS THAT YOU CAN USE UM I DON'T THINK YOU CAN USE THEM IN A COMBINATION
UM BUT UM I COULD CHECK BACK FOR YOU BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THEM IN A COMBINATION
UM I THINK PLASTIC AND RUBBER WOULD BE FINE BUT PLASTIC RUBBER AND WOOD I WASN'T I'M NOT VERY SURE ABOUT THE TITANIUM
THEY HAD SOME RESTRICTIONS ON USING THE RUBBER AND THE TITANIUM
UM THE RUBBER WAS A RESTRICTION ON THE KIND OF POWER SOURCE YOU COULD USE
BUT THE TITANIUM HAD A DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS ON THE SHAPE OF THE THING SO I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME RESTRICTION ON UM
I THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY GROUP PLASTIC AND RUBBER TOGETHER WOOD AND TITANIUM
BUT YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE EASIER FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE AND A COMPLEXITY JUST TO USE ONE
YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO TWO
UM AND THE OTHER COMPONENTS ARE LOGIC CHIPS UM AGAIN I'LL I'LL GO BACK TO THE COMPONENT CHIPS
THE COM HOW COMPLEX OR HOW EASY THE LOGIC IS IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY FUNCTIONS YOU HAVE ON THE ON THE UNIT
UM AND THAT IMPACTS COST
UM I DON'T THINK THE LOGIC CHIP HAS A ISSUE ABOUT SIZE 'CAUSE THEY SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
POWER CONSUMPTION SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME
UM I THINK THE MAIN IMPACT IS COMPLEXITY UM AND THE OTHER THING IS UM THE POWER OPTIONS
UM THE FIRST ONE IS A STANDARD BATTERY
OKAY THE SECOND ONE I THINK IS MORE OF A GIMMICK THEN ACTUALLY A USEABLE THING IT'S A WIND UP YOU KNOW A CRANK
YEAH BUT THAT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A LOOK AND FEEL DECISION BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE ONE POWER SOURCE IF YOU'RE USING THE ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES
I THINK WHATEVER IT IS YOU STILL NEED A BATTERY 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO KEEP DOING ONE THING
OKAY THE OTHER ONES ARE A SOLAR POWERED CELL
WHICH MAY NOT BE A GREAT IDEA IN EUROPE OR ANY COUNTRY THAT HAS SEASONS 'CAUSE HALF THE YEAR YOU'D BE DEAD
SO LIKE WHAT I SAID YOU PROBABLY NEED LIKE A BATTERY AND SOMETHING ELSE
UM AND THE KINETIC ONE I GUESS FOR ME IS THE MOST INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE IT'S MOVEMENT AND PEOPLE LIKE TO FIDDLE WITH THEIR AND IT'S A NICE SALES GIMMICK I THINK
FROM A MARKETING GIMMICK IT IT'S A TECHNOLOGY THING IT'S A SHAKE IT IT DOESN'T WORK SHAKE IT KNOCK IT OR SOMETHING
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOU HAD THOSE BALLS YOU KNOW THOSE STRESS BALLS WHERE YOU BOUNCE THE BALL AND IT AND IT LIGHTS UP AND IT GOES
YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A GIMMICK COMBINED WITH RUBBER
YOU KNOW JUST TO IF YOU GET FRUSTRATED WI REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN THROW IT KIND OF YOU KNOW JUST UH YOU KNOW UM SO
UM OKAY MY FROM MY ROLE I DON'T THINK THAT PERSONAL PREFERENCES BUT ROLE PREFERENCES I THINK UM SOMETHING COMFORTABLE TO HOLD
UM SMALL AND SLIM I GUESS THAT'S MORE IN THE SENSE OF SMALL AND SLIM IN TERMS OF COMFORTABLE NOT SO SMALL YOU CAN'T
YOU KNOW LIKE A PHONE OR SOMETHING TOO SMALL PHONE
UM AND THE OTHER THING IS FROM A PRODUCTION POINT OF VIEW UM THE LESS COMPONENTS WE USE AND THE SIMPLER THE COMPONENTS MEANS YOU REDUCE YOUR COST AND YOU INCREASE YOUR PROFIT
UM AND ALSO THE TIME TO MARKET AND THE COMPLEXITY OF DEVELOPING DESIGNING AND DEBUGGING IT UM SO
UM OKAY LET ME JUST GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS
UM
THE USER INTERFACE RESTRICTIONS BASICALLY MEANS THAT IF YOU USE MORE COMPLICATED FEATURES
LIKE THE BUTTONS ARE STANDARD OKAY THE L. C. D. PANEL AND THE SCROLL WHEEL YOU NEED MORE COMPLICATED LOGIC
UM THE CASE OKAY WITH A RUBBER CASE YOU CAN'T HAVE THE SOLAR PANELS
OKAY WITH THE TITANIUM CASE LET ME JUST CHECK THAT UM TITANIUM CASE CAN'T BE CURVED IT HAS TO BE SQUARE
OKAY UM THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON THE PLASTIC AND IT CAN'T BE CURVED ON THE WOOD
SO THAT'S AGAIN I DON'T THINK YOU CAN USE THEM IN A COMBINATION UM ESPECIALLY THE TITANIUM I I SUSPECT THEY'RE VERY FIXED TO A PARTICULAR NEED
SO UM MIXING THEM MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA UM YEP
THAT'S IT
UM I THINK WE COULD BECAUSE THE L. C. D. PANEL REQUIRES POWER AND THE L. C. D. IS A FORM OF A LIGHT SO THAT
ARE YOU THINKING ARE YOU THINKING OF OF A LIGHT IN THE SENSE OF UM A LIGHT LIGHT
OR A LIGHT IN THE SENSE OF IT GLOWS KIND OF YOU KNOW FRANKENSTEIN IT'S ALIVE
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
UM THAT'S WHY I THINK THE OPTION OF THE THE KINETIC THING WHICH BASICALLY MEANS AS LONG AS YOU SHAKE IT LIKE A WATCH LIKE AN AUTOMATIC WATCH
UM IT'S PROBABLY SENSITIVE ENOUGH WHEN YOU FIDDLE IT
SO YOU COULD TRIGGER THAT TO A LIGHT LIKE I SAID THE BOUNCING BALL THING
OR YOU COULD TRIGGER THAT TO USE THAT TO POWER THE LIGHT AS OPPOSED TO SO WHEN THEY PICK IT UP
RIGHT AND THEN THAT THAT SORTA TRIGGERS THE
GLOWINGNESS
I THINK HE MADE THAT
IS THERE A PARTICULAR SHAPE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN
LIKE DOES MARKETING HAVE ANY RESEARCH ON DOES IT NEED TO BE LONG
DOES IT NEED WITH A SQUARE THING WHA
YEAH 'CAUSE THAT WILL N HELP NARROW DOWN THE CHOICE OF
LIKE FRUIT
I'M THINKING FRUITS IN MY HEAD BUT THAT'S TACKY
DO WE NEED AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
WHAT WHAT'S THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THAT
YEAH BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE USING IT WHAT WOULD WE WHAT WOULD WE ACHIEVE FROM IT
PUTTING IN LIGHTS IS CHEAP BUT PUTTING IN AN L. C. D. PANEL JUST TO MAKE IT GLOW IS A BIT OF A
MM-HMM
I THINK THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN INPUT DEVICE TO GET THE LISTINGS INTO IT
SO UM IT'S A BIT NUTS TO GET THE MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY YOU KNOW
UM I I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S NO NEED FOR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY BUT UM IT'S WHAT'S WHAT WHAT WOULD IT TELL THE USER
'CAUSE THE L. C. D. TENDS TO BE AN OUTPUT AS UH AS OPPOSED TO AN INPUT SO UM DOES THE REMOTE CONTROL NEED TO TALK BACK TO THE USER
WE HAVE THE OPTION OF THE SPEAKER AS WELL THE SA THE SAME THING GOES FOR THE SPEAKER
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO TO TALK BACK
UM
YOU COULD PUT A GAME ON IT
WHEN THE T. V. DIES YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL
WHERE WOULD YOU PHYSICALLY POSITION THE BUTTONS
UM I THINK THAT THAT HAS SOME IMPACT ON ON ON MANY THINGS
UM MAYBE YOU WANNA DRAW ONTO THE
YEP
NO LIKE I SAID WE HAVE A H HYBRID KIND OF THING SO IT'S NOT GONNA CHARGE THE BATTERY IT'S JUST
YEAH
YEP
YES YES
OR EVEN A CLEAR CASE
UM YOU KNOW A A GLOWING A A GLOWING YELLOW TYPE CASE WHERE THE YELLOW IS SHOWABLE BUT IN THE DARK IT SORT OF IT'S ALIVE
UM IN IN A SLIGHT SUBTLE WAY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
OR OR THERE MIGHT BE A LIGHT RUNNING THROUGH IT LIKE A MOUSE
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE CORDLESS MICE AND THEY DON'T EAT THAT MUCH POWER RIGHT
SO THE POWER THE BATTERY IN THAT SENSE MAYBE YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO STRATIG STRATEGICALLY PLACED LIGHTS THAT SORT OF
YEAH BUT BECAUSE THE CASE IS TRANSPARENT SO IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT OF A GLOW DOESN'T MAKE IT FREAKY
THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU'RE ROLLING IT HOW DO YOU WANNA ROLL IT
DO YOU WANT 'EM TO ROLL IT LIKE THAT
DO YOU WANT 'EM TO ROLL IT LIKE THAT
'CAUSE IN A MOUSE YOUR HAND'S IN A POSITION TO ROLL IT
WHEREAS THE OTHER THING ABOUT HAVING IT JOG DIAL THIS WAY IT TENDS TO GET MOVED ACCIDENTALLY
THAT'S A VERY UNNATURAL MOTION TO YEAH
CAN YOU IMAGINE YOU HAVE TO SCROLL A LOT
UM IT MIGHT WORK FOR VOLUME AND MAYBE SOME OF THE BRIGHTNESS CONTROLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT NOT FOR CHANNELS RIGHT
IF YOU HAVE A TELEWEST BOX YOU'VE GOT LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ALL THE CHANNELS YOU'VE ABOUT FIFTY CHANNELS CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO
UM AND I DON'T THINK HAVING THAT YOU KNOW TOO QUICK TOO SLOW KIN IT'S CONFUSING TO THE I DUNNO
BUT USERS TEND TO TEND TO WANT TO USE THAT AND ONCE THEY LOSE OUT ON THE USER EXPERIENCE THEY'RE LIKE
BECAUSE THAT'S BECOMES THE MOST ACCESSIBLE THING IN FRONT OF
YEAH
SO YOU WANNA EXPAND THE SHAPE OF THE
THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE ONE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF UM IN TERMS OF WHETHER YOU'RE LEFT HANDED OR YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED YOU MIGHT BE LOCKING YOURSELF IN
COULD I JUST COULD I JUST JUMP IN AND SUGGEST SOMETHING QUICKLY
UM I THINK ONE THING WOULD BE THE JOG DIAL 'CAUSE THAT'S GONNA HAVE QUITE A BIG IMPACT ON THE THING UM
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING THE A SLIDE BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT THE HAND
I THINK INCORPORATING A LOGO IS QUITE STRAIGHT FORWARD
THERE'S LOTS OF SPACE FOR IT UM
YEAH BUT IT'S ALSO A A MARKETING AND A FUNCTION
YEAH
FEEL LIKE FRUIT
FRUITS KIDS
NO LIKE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH KINDA LIKE THAT YEAH
PLAY DOH TIME
YOU GOT TO CHOOSE FIRST
NO WE'RE KIDDING
OKAY CAN I JUST SWIPE YOUR POWER CABLE I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS
OKAY LEMME OKAY I'M GONNA PULL EVERYBODY OUT FIRST AND THEN PUT IN WHOEVER NEEDS TO BE LEFT
IT'S YOU
ARGH
THIS IS A REAL HASSLE AND A OOPS
I'M GONNA TAKE THE MICROPHONES 'CAUSE IT'S TOO LAZY T TAKE THEM OFF AGAIN
COOL
OKAY
OKAY WELL
OKAY
OKAY WE ALL READY TO GO
WELL HOW UM ON THE IN THIS MEETING THEN IF WE UM
I'LL JUST JUST RECAP ON THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING
AND WE UH DECIDED ON
DECIDED ON OUR OUR TARGET GROUP BEING FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE AND WE DECIDED THAT IT WAS GONNA BE NON RECHARGEABLE BATTERY POWERED
THAT WE'RE GONNA GROUP OUR AUDIO VISUAL AND OTHER FUNCTIONS INTO INTO THOSE CATEGORIES UM
AND I TOLD YOU GUYS ABOUT THE THREE NEW REQUIREMENTS ABOUT IGNORING TELETEXT IGNORING EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE T. V.
AND TRYING TO INCORPORATE THE THE UH CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN
UM SO THAT WAS THE LAST MEETING
IS THERE ANYTHING HAVE I FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
IS THAT EVERYTHING
OKAY
UM SO IF WE HAVE THE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND THEN IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO KIND OF THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO DISCUSS
MAYBE JUST MAKE A NOTE OF IT AND WE'LL HAVE ALL THE DISCUSSION AT THE END
THAT MIGHT BE A BETTER IDEA THIS TIME
AND SO IF WE START OFF UH WITH ANDREW AND THEN CRAIG AND THEN DAVID IF THAT'S ALRIGHT
UM AND THEN AFTER THAT WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT STUFF RIGHT
SO IF YOU WANNA TAKE THIS
SCREWED IN QUITE TIGHTLY
UH WHAT DID UH HOW DID WE LEAVE IT WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION NOW
WE DID WE SAY WE WERE GONNA TRY MAYBE INCORPORATE IT BUT WE HADN'T MADE A DEFINITE DECISION ON THAT
RIGHT
OH I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT UM THE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF FINAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH A DECISION ON THE CONCEPTS OF THE PRODUCT
SO UM THAT'S KIND OF THE END RESULT HOPEFULLY
UH-HUH
HOPEFULLY APPEAR IN A WEE SECOND
UP THERE WE GO
OH NO
OH RIGHT
HERE WE GO
OKAY
MM-HMM
AYE A FAIR POINT DEFINITELY
OKAY
AYE RIGHT
UH-HUH
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
MM-HMM
MM THAT'S TRUE YEAH
MM 'KAY
GREAT
OKAY
YEAH
AH
OKAY
THAT'S GREAT
UH-HUH
OKAY GREAT
UM THANK YOU FOR THAT
UH CRAIG DO YOU WANNA
UH PLUG YOURS IN THEN
MM
NOT QUITE
OH SOMETHING COMING NOW YEAH
THERE WE GO
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
I THINK IT'S YELLOW BECAUSE LIKE THE WEBSITE IS YELLOW AND THERE'S A BAND AT THE BOTTOM IS YELLOW SO YELLOW
LEMON YOU KNOW DEFINITELY FOOD FOR THOUGHT THERE BUT KEEP GOING AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT AFTER
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
MM
AYE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH THAT THAT WAS VERY GOOD AND UH NOW WITH DAVID
I KNOW IT'D BE HANDY WOULDN'T IT
DO Y DO YOU WANNA SIT IN THE THE LINE OF SIGHT OF THIS UM
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
MM
MM-HMM
WE YOU COULDN'T HAVE LIKE PLASTIC AND RUBBER
YEAH
MM 'KAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
I'LL CLEAR ONE OF THESE THINGS FOR YOU
JUST BY MOVING IT YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
MM
W YEAH
UH YEAH YEAH I SEE
YEAH
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
OKAY
RIGHT CAN I
YEAH WELL YEAH IT'S JUST I'M QUITE KEEN TO GET THE DISCUSSION GOING WITH THE TIME WE'VE LEFT SO BUT YEAH YOU C ASK AWAY
MM
WHY WHAT KIND OF LIGHT DO YOU WANT ARE YOU THINKING OF
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
LIKE A PHONE YEAH LIKE THE BACKLIGHT IN A PHONE
OKAY COOL
YEAH
MM
MM
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT OKAY UM WELL LET'S JUST GO RIGHT BACK TO THE MARKETING IDEAS FOR A START
AND JUST GIVING AN ID IDEA ON THE TIME WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO PLAY WITH AT MOST
SO UM YEAH SO JUST T TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH AN DECISION ON THE THE THE CONCEPTS OF THE PRODUCT
SO BACK TO YOUR IDEA ABOUT UM INCORPORATING THE IDEA OF LIKE FRUIT AND VEG AND THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND THINGS LIKE THAT
UM I MEAN WHAT DOES EVERYBODY THINK ABOUT
DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY IDEAS OF ABOUT HOW WE CAN FIT ALL THAT IN TOGETHER
I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF THE USER INTERFACE TYPE OF THING WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT
SO MAYBE DO Y ARE WE THINKING SOMETHING THAT LIKE S COULD SIT IN YOUR HAND COMFORTABLY OR DO YOU TH YOU'D HOLD ONTO COMFORTABLY OR
SO SOMETHING QUITE CURVY
OKAY UM RIGHT OKAY
COLOUR WISE I MEAN YOU MADE A RE UH WAS IT YOU OR UH I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO MADE THE POINT ABOUT HOW IF YOU'VE A NICE BRIGHT COLOUR YOU'LL NOT LOSE IT
WAS THAT
WHOSE ABOUT HOW IF YOU HAVE A BRIGHT COLOUR YOU'LL NOT LOSE IT SO MUCH
UM AND WHEN THE CORPORATE COLOUR IS YELLOW I MEAN MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT ABOUT THE COLOUR OF THE WHOLE PRODUCT BEING YELLOW I DON'T KNOW
UM
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE UH THE MATERIALS WHEN IT HAS ANYBODY GOT LIKE AN OVERALL PICTURE IN THEIR MIND ABOUT WHAT WHAT MIGHT WORK
THAT'S ALL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
OH YOU KNOW LIKE IN CIRCULAR IN SHAPE OR
CHOICE OF MATERIAL YEAH
'CAUSE I I I WAS KINDA THINKING ABOUT AS WELL YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET THESE SHOCK RESISTANT MOBILE PHONES
AND THEY'RE PLASTIC BUT THEN ALSO HAVE LIKE RUBBER ON THE OUTSIDE AND IT KINDA FEELS IT FEELS KIND OF WARMER TO THE TOUCH
IT FEELS A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE AND MAYBE WE COULD INCORPORATE PLASTIC AND RUBBER
INTO IT
AND THEN THEN WE COULD HAVE CURVED SHAPES 'CAUSE WOOD OR TITANIUM YEAH
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE BOXY AND RECTANGULAR AND I THINK WE MIGHT BE MOVING AWAY FROM THAT YOU KNOW SO UM
WELL I'M DO WE REALLY WANT IT IN LIKE THE SHAPE OF A LEMON OR NO I DON'T THINK WE DO EITHER
OKAY RIGHT WELL UM SO THOUGHTS ABOUT THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF THE THING
A SNOWMAN SHAPE
UH-HUH
THAT'S QUITE A DISTINCTIVE SHAPE THAT WOULD BE GOOD WOULDN'T IT
YEAH SO YEAH SHOULD WE GO WITH THAT
DO YOU WANNA DRAW IT ON THE BOARD
OOH THAT'D BE GOOD
MM-HMM
SO CALL IT THE SNOWMAN SHAPE TRADEMARK
YEAH THAT'S COOL
UM AND I MEAN COLOUR WISE WHAT DOES EVERYBODY THINK
I THINK IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT TO GET YELLOW IN THERE SOMEWHERE
I MEAN DO YOU WANT THE WHOLE THING YELLOW MAYBE LIKE YELLOW AND WHITE DO YOU WANT SOMETHING
UH-HUH
OKAY COOL
UM AND ALSO I MEAN HOW ARE WE GOING TO INCORPORATE THE SLOGAN IN
THE FACT THAT IT TALKS TO YOU I MEAN IT MIGHT BE QUITE COOL IF WHEN YOU FIRST START USING IT IT SAYS
WHAT IS IT PUTTING FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS OR SOMETHING I DUNNO
OR WHEN YOU LIKE OR IF YOU TURN IT OFF OR SOMETHING IF IT CAN SPEAK IF IT COULD ACTUALLY SAY THE SLOGAN IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE POWERFUL THAN JUST HAVING IT WRITTEN ON IT SOMEWHERE
I D I D ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT AT ALL
I KNOW
UM UNLESS AN A I MEAN IF YOU ALSO WOULD THAT WORK IF WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE UM AN L. C. D. DISPLAY WHERE WOULD WE PUT THAT
WOULD WE PUT THAT ON THE INSIDE OR
IT'S BOUND TO INCREASE THE COST OF IT A LOT I WOULD'VE THOUGHT
YEAH
MM OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
SO SO NO NEED FOR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY COMPLEX
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS REALLY NO UM
I WOULD SAY NO NEED FOR A TALK BACK
UH DOES ANYBODY DISAGREE WITH THAT
NO
EASY
OKAY UM RIGHT SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE THREE DIFFERENT SETS OF OF FUNCTIONALITIES
UM I MEAN DO YOU WANNA GROUP THEM INTO S HEAD OF THE SNOWMAN BODY OF THE SNOWMAN INSIDE OF THE SNOWMAN IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
OKAY
OKAY RIGHT UM WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT
SO I'M JUST GONNA UM POP THIS IN HERE 'CAUSE I HAVE A SLIDE ABOUT DECISION MAKING WHICH I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT
OH SH GOD WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES UM OKAY UH BACK WE GO
UM ENERGY WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S SUGGESTING WE'RE HOW WE'RE POWERING THE THING
I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF THIS KINETIC THING WHERE YOU'D HAVE THE BACK UP OF THE BATTERY
BUT HAVE HAVE KINETIC POWER I MEAN WHAT DOES ANYBODY THINK ABOUT THAT
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I SUPPOSE THAT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE AWAY AND YOU'RE NOT USING IT THEN YOU'RE NOT USING ANY POWER EITHER
SO YOU'D HAVE THE BATTERY AS THE KIND OF TO KEEP IT TICKING OVER IDEA I'M REALLY SORRY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WRAP UP QUITE QUICKLY
WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS I THOUGHT
UM SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT ENERGY IS REFERRING TO HERE
CHIP ON PRINT IS THAT THAT'S AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGN THING IS IT DAVID
OKAY UM AS FOR THE CASE KIND OF DISCUSSED THAT
YEAH I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE RUBBER BUTTONS THAT FEEL KIND OF
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
COULD HAVE THINGS LIKE BACKLIGHTING THE BUTTONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
AYE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
S SO LIKE CUR SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT CASE SO IT'S YELLOW LIKE TINTED YELLOW BUT YOU CAN MAYBE SEE THROUGH IT
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN
OKAY
LIGHTS
OKAY
MM
YEAH
YEAH IF YOU ARE HOLDING IT IN YOUR HAND YOU COULD YOU COULD DO THAT COULDN'T YOU
IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT IN YOUR HAND YOU COULD
DO YOU THINK
OKAY
MM
YEAH OKAY OKAY UM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
JUST
OKAY UM RIGHT WELL WOULDN'T IT WE DO NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER WE WANT TO INCORPORATE A JOG DIAL IN NICE AND QUICKLY
UM I'M ALL FOR THEM ACTUALLY I THINK THEY'RE QUITE YOU KNOW TH VERY QUICK TO M TO USE
SO DOES ANYBODY OPPOSE THE IDEA OF OF INCORPORATING ONE INTO THE DESIGN AT ALL
NO
AND THE OTHER THING WAS UM CAN WE THINK OF ANY WAY OF GETTING THE SLOGAN INTO THIS THING
UH-HUH
UH-HUH OOH OKAY WE REALLY GOTTA WRAP UP SO YEAH
OKAY WELL IF WE CAN DO THAT GREAT
YEAH OKAY
YEAH LET'S LET'S TRY AND GET THE SLOGAN ON THERE UM AND
MM
OKAY
RIGHT I'M GONNA HAVE TO I'M REALLY GONNA HAVE TO HURRY YOU ON HERE 'CAUSE WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY OVER TIME
UM IS THERE ANYTHING ANYBODY'S UNSURE ABOUT
JUST FOR IN CLOSING JUST THE NEXT MEETING'S GONNA BE IN THIRTY MINUTES
AND SO YOU CAN SEE IN THE SCREEN HERE WHAT EACH OF YOU ARE GONNA HOPEFULLY BE DOING
UH I KNOW THAT THE DESIGNERS ARE GONNA BE WORKING WITH PLAY DOH ON THAT
SO UM THAT'LL BE THAT'LL BE GOOD
UM AND I'LL GET THE THE MINUTES UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
ANYTHING AT ALL YOU THINK WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THAT WE NEED TO
IS EVERYBODY KIND OF HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE DOING
OKAY
THAT'S KIND OF A DESIGN THING THAT YOU GUYS CAN CAN DISCUSS YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
TO MAKE SOMETHING FLUSH WITH THE CASE
OKAY RIGHT
OKAY
SP KINDA GRIPPY
OKAY
OKAY I'M GONNA HAVE TO I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL THIS TO A CLOSE 'CAUSE WE'RE WAY OVER TIME
SO UM THAT'S REALLY GOOD LIKE WE'VE S HAD MUCH TO TALK ABOUT THAT UM PRETTY MUCH RUN OUT OF TIME TO DO SO
SO OFF YOU GO AND DESIGN STUFF WOOH
YEAH QUITE JEALOUS ACTUALLY
IS IT WORKING
AND SO THINK OF THIS CONCEPT
UM TO RESEARCH IT I'VE UM HAD A LOOK ON THE THE HOMEPAGE AGAIN
IT'S PROVIDED ME WITH MORE EXAMPLES OF UM PREVIOUSLY EXISTING C REMOTE CONTROLS
UM THERE'S A WEE BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OTHER EXISTING ONES THERE
UM SO I'VE TAKEN THE UM SUGGESTIONS FROM THEM AND TRIED TO INCORPORATE THEM INTO THIS UM
SO THEN THIS WE'RE LOOKING FOR UM SUGGESTIONS ON SIZE TH UM SIZE OF CONTROL AND THE BUTTONS
UM THE SHAPE OF THE CONTROL AND WHEREABOUT THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE LOCATED ON THE CONTROL
UM WHAT I FOUND FROM THE RESEARCH IS THAT MOST THE CURRENT CONTROLS ARE JUST BASICALLY BIG BRICKS WITH LOADS OF BUTTONS ALL OVER THEM
UM THEY'RE NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT AND THEY'RE NOT VERY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD
THEY'RE I JUST HOLD 'EM LIKE BIG BRICKS AND THEY'RE VERY EASILY LOST
UM THEY TEND TO BE VERY DARK COLOURS SO IF THERE ARE SHADOWY PLACES DOWN THE SIDE OF COUCHES YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM
UM THE THE CONTROLS THEMSELVES TEND TO USE A VERY INCONSISTENT COLOUR SCHEME
UM FOR INSTANCE THE STAND BY BUTTON ISN'T ALWAYS RED UH IT REALLY SHOULD BE
IT'S UH SOMETHING THE USER THEN UH IDENTIFY WITH
THIS IS A RED SWITCH OFF THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE
UM I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT BUT SOMETHING TO LOOK OUT FOR
UM THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT I'VE I'VE GOT COUPLE OF PREFERENCES FOR THE THE END CONTROL UM I GET 'EM WITH THE THE RED COLOUR BUTTON FOR STAND BY AND S THE OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT UM
THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE LARGE
THEY SHOULDN'T BE TINY LITTLE THINGS LIKE YOU GET ON SOME MOBILE PHONES
THEY SHOULD BE EASY TO PRESS VERY COMFORTABLE
UM ONE OF THE EXAMPLES GIVEN ON THE HOMEPAGE WAS UM THERE'S AN UP AND DOWN VOLUME BUTTON BUT BOTH OF THEM HAVE A V. ON THEM
SO THE UP VOLUME BUTTON LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD BE A DOWN VOLUME BUTTON THAT'S KINDA CONFUSING
UM SHOULD AVOID S THINGS LIKE THAT
UM IF THE THE CORPORATE COLOUR SCHEME ALLOWS IT WE SHOULD HAVE A VERY BRIGHT COLOUR SO THAT IT CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED ANYWHERE
UM OBVIOUSLY TRYING TRYING TO AVOID BEING TACKY THERE BUT IT COULD UM TIE IN VERY EASILY WITH YOUR YOUR LIME AND LEMON IDEA
FANTASTIC
UM
ANY EXTRA FEATURES WE ADD BEYOND THE BASIC ONES SHOULD BE M HIDDEN
THEY SHOULDN'T BE ON THE UM SHOULDN'T BE VISIBLE WITHOUT SOMETHING BE OPENED OR SOME SORT OF SPECIAL EXTRA EFFORT
UM IF WE DID DECIDE TO GO FOR VOICE ACTIVATION THERE SH SHOULD ALWAYS BE A BUTTON AS ALTERNATIVE
POSSIBLY HIDDEN IN THE THE OPENED UP SECTION UM MAKING THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH IT OR WITH SOMEBODY'S VOICE MAYBE THEY GOT A COLD OR
UM WE SHOULD DEFINITELY AVOID THE BIG SQUARE BLOCK LOOK
THAT'S JUST WRONG
AND UM WE GOT AN EMAIL UH FROM I THINK IT'S THE THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT
AND THEY'VE SAID TH THE VOICE CONTROL UM CAN NOW TALK BACK IF YOU ASK IT A QUESTION
SO IT SH IT COULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THEM UM CONFIRM ANY ACTION YOU TAKE
AND POSSIBILITY
RIGHT AND THESE ARE PROBLEMS I'VE HAD WITH IT
UM I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SLOGAN SHOULD GO OR REALLY WHAT THE SLOGAN IS
I THINK IT'S UM FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS
AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW FLEXIBLE THE COLOUR SCHEME IS
I MEAN YOU SAY YOU WANTED THE THE CORPORATE COLOURS BUT THEY DON'T SAY YOU KNOW IF WE CAN USE ANY OTHER COLOURS AT ALL OR
THAT'S IT
I THINK I'M COOL
RIGHT
RIGHT
UM I THINK WE COULD GO FOR LIKE UM MAYBE NOT A P A FRUIT SHAPE BUT A VERY SORT OF CURVY TYPE SHAPE
UM YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME SORT OF TEXTURE AND COLOUR AS A FRUIT
UM PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT S SITS IN YOUR HAND COMFORTABLY SORT OF FEELS RIGHT IN YOUR HAND
SEE I'M
I'D QUITE LIKE A SORT OF UH SNOWMAN TYPE SHAPE
UM SO A P SORT OF LARGER BIT SITS IN YOUR HAND AND THEN YOU GOT MAYBE ANOTHER BUBBLE AT THE TOP FOR JUST ANY OTHER FUNCTION YOU NEED
UM SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM YOU GOT TWO GROUPS THERE UM MAYBE IT COULD FOLD UP AND YOU GET A THIRD GROUP INSIDE OR UH YOU HAVE VOLUME CONTROLS ABOUT THERE
SO I RECKON IT'D LOOK QUITE NICE IF WE JUST HAD UM THIS HERE
HAD A SORTA BACKGROUND YELLOW AND THEN HAVE SORT OF A NICE BOLD COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS
I THINK THAT MIGHT SCARE ME
I THINK THAT'D PROBABLY SCARE ME
YOU TURN IT ON YOUR CONTROL POSSESSED S
UM
NAH
UM WELL I THINK THE ADVANCED ONES THE THE ONES YOU DON'T USUALLY USE COULD BE HID INSIDE
B UM I THINK THE WE HAD WERE FAIRLY BASIC ONES THEY'D HAVE TO GO ON THE THE FRONT SOMEWHERE
UM
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH
MM
WELL BUT THEN FOR UM FOR SKIPPING A LARGE AMOUNT OF CHANNELS YOU DO HAVE TO UH TO SKIP THE CHANNEL BUTTON THE NUMBER PART
UH BUT
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH SURE
IT KINDA DOES MAKE SENSE DOESN'T IT BECAUSE WHEN WE GET INTO THE END OF MEETING WE'RE KIND OF TALKING ABOUT ACTION AND DESIGN AS OPPOSED TO BACKGROUND
EVERYTHING I HAVE IS KINDA BACKGROUND
MM-HMM
UH THAT SOUNDS
SURE
OKAY
SURE
YEAH COOL
WHY DON'T I GET THAT
HMM
OKAY
OKAY
UM ALRIGHT SO C IS IT FUNCTION F. EIGHT
HMM
COME ON
I THINK IT'S WORKING
OKAY GREAT S SO LET ME JUST START THIS
OKAY GREAT
SO UM UH S MOVE ON
UH-HUH OH WHERE'D IT ALL GO
IT'S NOT GOOD
OKAY LEMME JUST SEE WHERE I CAN FIND IT
THIS LOOKS MORE LIKE IT
I THINK I JUST OPENED UP THE TEMPLATE
SORRY ABOUT THAT
OKAY ALRIGHT SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK HERE
OKAY SO THIS WAS THE METHOD THAT UM I'VE TAKEN
UH BASICALLY WHAT I WANNA DO HERE BEFORE WE GET INTO IT UH TOO FAR
IS I WANT TO SHOW YOU ALL THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION I HAVE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IF WE WANT THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AND UH AND THEN SORTA G GO THROUGH SOME OF THE WAY THAT I'VE DEALT WITH THAT INFORMATION
AND THEN SORT OF BRING US ALL TOGETHER INTO IT TO SEE SORTA SEE HOW THIS FITS IN WITH THE OVERALL VISION
UM SO I'VE TRIED TO TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MARKET RESEARCH AND SUMMARISE IT FOR US
AND THEN IDE IDENTIFY UH TRENDS THAT ARE ARE SORT OF IN SYNC AND ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR OUR UH P PROJECT PLAN THAT WE HAVE SO FAR
AND THEN UH INITIATE A KIND OF DISCUSSION ON DESIGN OPTIONS SO THAT IT SORTA HELPS US TO TO NARROW IN ON ON ASPECTS THAT WILL INFORM OTHER UH OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE PROJECT
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE THA THAT SORT OF STRATEGY
I THOUGHT THAT THAT WILL IMPACT ON THE REST OF WHAT WE DO SO THAT'S WHY I SUGGESTED WE GET IN THIS
OKAY SO OUT OF UM DIFFERENT UH FIGURES AND RATINGS OB UH OF PEOPLE IN GENERAL
UM CONSUMERS IN GENERAL THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WAS FOUND WAS THAT UH THE BR T TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL OKAY AND NOT IT SPECIFIED NOT A FUNCTIONAL LOOK OR OR FEEL UH B F F FANCY
UM HOWEVER THIS IS WHERE WE KINDA HAVE TO BE VERY I THINK CREATIVE ABOUT IT
NUMBER TWO WAS THAT IT BE INNOVATIVE
OKAY SO THAT TELLS ME THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO BE INNOVATIVE WITHOUT A ADDING JUST UNNECESSARY UM SORT OF FUNCTIONAL BITS TO IT
UH AND THIRD PRIORITY UH FOR EASE OF USE SO AGAIN THAT KIND OF GIVES US A GENERAL PICTURE OF HOW IT HAS TO BE
UM QUITE USER FRIENDLY WHILE STILL HAVING TECHNOLOGY
SO IT I'LL JUST SAY RIGHT AWAY AS A BIT OF A FORESHADOWING INTO HOW WE PROCEED WITH THIS IN TERMS OF M MARKETING
IS THAT I THINK UM WHAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS HOW THE UM
ABOUT HOW THE INNOVATION UH CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOOK AND FEEL AND NOT SO MUCH TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WHEN YOU PICK IT UP AND PUSH IT LIKE IT ALL LIGHTS UP OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE
OR IT'S GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO IT THAT JUST SEEMS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE THING THAT THE MESSAGE HERE IS EASE OF USE
SO HOW DO YOU MAKE INNOVATION MAKE SOMETHING MORE MORE EASY TO USE
WELL THAT'S I GUESS WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THIS
OKAY THEN THERE'S THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE BACK THE THE MARKET UM
RESEARCH I HAVE HERE IS ON FASHION STYLE OKAY WHICH AS WE'VE AGREED IS A PRIORITY
UH TOP EUROPEAN FASHION TREND UM THAT I READ ABOUT SAYS THERE'S THIS EMERGING THEME OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES OKAY ESPECIALLY IN CLOTHES AND FURNITURE
AND WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT I THOUGHT HMM WELL DO WE WANT TO ACTUALLY TRY AND THINK ABOUT THIS TREND AND HOW WE ADD SOMETHING TO IT
OR WE GET RIGHT INTO IT OR WE COMPLETELY STEER AWAY FROM IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
SO MY MY FEELING IS THAT WE W DO WANT TO OBSERVE THIS TREND
BUT WE WANT TO THINK ALSO ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT SORT OF HAS TO FIT IN WITH SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT SPECIFICALLY ELECTRONICS
UM 'CAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE IN WHAT WE'RE IN IS PARTLY SORT OF HOME DECOR PARTLY SOMETHING LIKE A COMPUTER
UM SO I THINK WE MIGHT WANNA BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW HOW QUICKLY WE CREATE LIKE A REMOTE CONTROL IN THE SHAPE OF AN APPLE OR SOMETHING
I THINK THAT WOULD BE PUSHING IT
AND THEN IN TERMS OF M MATERIAL TRENDS ARE FOR THINGS TO BE SOFT AND SPONGY AND SORT OF YOU MIGHT SAY ERGONOMIC OR OR FRIENDLY TO HANDLE
WHICH IS WHICH ALSO IN INDICATED THAT LAST YEAR THIS WAS THIS WAS NOT THE CASE
SO UM PROBABLY A LOT OF THE COMPETITION ON THE MARKET WILL BE STILL IN LAST YEAR'S MODE
SO IF WE TRY AND REALLY CAPITALISE ON THAT I THINK THAT'LL BE IN OUR FAVOUR
UM
SO THESE THIS IS THE SUMMARY OF EVERYTHING
UM STYLE IS NUMBER ONE UH THING IN THE IN THE MARKET OF WHO WE'RE SELLING TO
UH INNOVATIVE DESIGN TECHNOLOGY'S ALSO A MUST IN THAT IT'S SEEN IT'D BE SEEN TO BE UH CUTTING EDGE
UH BUT EASE OF USE T HAS TO BE INSURED THROUGHOUT
THAT WAS LIKE THE NUMBER THREE THING
AND THEN AT THE END THERE ARE VIBRANT NATURAL COLOURS UM
THAT'S THE WAY I INTERPRETED IT ANYWAY SOFTNESS IN MATERIALS SHAPE AND FUNCTION
AND SO I'VE WRITTEN AT WRITTEN AT THE BOTTOM TO GIVE US SORT OF A CONTEXT OF DISCUSSION
MAC IPODS SOMETHING WHICH IS I'D HAVE TO SAY VERY HIGH TECH
TEN GIGABYTES WHATEVER BUT WHEN YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND THERE'S LIKE NO BUTTONS
YOU KNOW WHAT A MAC IPOD IS
I'M THINKING HOWEVER MAC IPOD IS SORT OF LAST YEAR'S BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD AND SORT OF GLASSY AND GLOSSY
SO I'M THINKING IF WE IMAGINE THAT WE'RE TAKING SOME OF THE FEATURES OF A MAC IPOD AND WE'RE THEN MAKING IT S MORE OF LIKE A MORE OF LIKE A COMFORTABLE TYPE OF OR MORE OF LIKE A
MAYBE MORE VIBRANT TO FRIENDLY THING TO HAVE
UM AND THEN SO THIS IS W WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION WHAT I'M WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IN THIS SLIDE HERE IS THAT WE WE TAKE THESE IDEAS
AND AS WE GET INTO MORE THE MORE UM TECHNI LIKE SORT OF PRODUCTION SIDE OF THINGS
THAT WE THINK ABOUT SHAPE MATERIALS AND THEMES OR SERIES THAT GO THROUGHOUT
SORT OF LIKE A
I DUNNO LIKE UM WE THINK OF SOME KIND OF A THIN THEME THAT UNIFIES IT ALL THAT WE AGREE ON UH SORTA LIKE A MARKETING IDENTITY
UM
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
YEAH
SO SO LIKE I THREW OUT A FEW IDEAS THERE JUST TO KINDA GET US THINKING ALONG THOSE LINES LIKE LEMON
LIME I DUNNO GREEN COLOURS PE WHATEVER IT'S JUST AN IDEA
'CAUSE I'M THINKING THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS WILL SEEM QUITE COHERENT IF WE USE THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR WHAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THIS THEM WITH IN TERMS OF TEXTURE
SHAPE COLOURS THINGS LIKE THAT
LIKE UM THE ONES THE ONES WHICH I'M MOST FOND OF IN TERMS OF GIVING LIKE A THEME TO IT WOULD BE LIKE UM LIKE LEMON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHICH IS LIKE YOU SEE A LOT IN IN OTHER AREAS
LIKE I SEE LOTS OF WEBSITES AND THINGS THAT SEEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH LIKE LEMON AND LIME AND
SO ANYWAY IT'S JUST JUST AN IDEA
I'M THINKING MAYBE WE COULD INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE FEATURES INTO A FAIRLY UM INTO SOMETHING WHICH IS WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO IT WHICH IS ALMOST GIMMICKY BECAUSE LIKE UM LIKE SOMETHING TO DO WITH LIKE LIGHTING WITHIN IT
LIKE YOU KNOW JUST WITHIN THE SIMPLE SENSE WHEN YOU PICK UP A PHONE AND TOUCH A BUTTON IT UH LIGHTS UP Q USUALLY THE BUTTONS LIGHT UP
HOW CAN WE BUILD ON THAT
MAYBE LIKE IT COULD LIGHT UP IN DIFFERENT COLOURS OR SOMETHING OR OR PEOPLE COULD BUY THE BUY THE CONTROL AND THEN IT COMES WITH DIFFERENT LIKE
COVERS OR SOMETHING SO
ANYWAY THOSE ARE THAT'S ALL I HAVE BUT UH HOPEFULLY WE CAN WE CAN REVISIT THOSE IDEAS WHEN WE GET INTO
YEP
DID YOU PRESS F. EIGHT
YEAH
OKAY DO WE HAVE A CORPORATE COLOUR SCHEME
I DIDN'T KNOW
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
MM
GREAT
LOTS OF GOOD INFORMATION THERE
IT'S A SHAME THE CABLE WASN'T JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE HUH
JUST UM
IT TAKES A SECOND DOESN'T IT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
THEY'RE STANDARD AREN'T THEY
YEAH
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
HMM
NO
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT CAN'T BE CURVED
OKAY
UH QUESTION ON CAN I ASK A QUESTION
OKAY
CAN WE UH POWER A LIGHT IN THIS
CAN WE GET A STRONG ENOUGH BATTERY TO POWER A LIGHT
OKAY
SO MAYBE ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN JUST TRY AND INCLUDE IS A REALLY GOOD BATTERY
WELL
I MEAN I'M THINKING IT MIGHT BE
THAT FOR UH THIS TO BE A HIGH TECH THING IT'S GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING HIGH TECH ABOUT IT AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE BATTERY POWER
AND TO MAKE THAT TO MAKE THAT A REALISTIC GOAL I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL COME UP LATER IS CAN THE BATTERY POWER IT
ILLUMINATE THE BUTTONS
YEAH IT GLOWS
WELL M I'M THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF YOU'RE YOU'RE IN THE DARK WATCHING A D. V. D. AND YOU UM YOU FIND THE THING IN THE DARK AND YOU GO LIKE THIS
AND THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY DOES
OH WHERE'S THE VOLUME BUTTON IN THE DARK AND UH Y YOU JUST TOUCH IT OR YOU JUST PICK IT UP AND IT LIGHTS UP OR SOMETHING
LIKE A PHONE YEAH YEAH
WHEREAS WITH PHONES PEOPLE CHARGE THEM ONCE A WEEK
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO PUT IN A REALLY GOOD BATTERY SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO CHARGE THEIR R REMOTE CONTROL EVERY FEW DAYS
BUT ARE PEOPLE GONNA WANNA SHAKE THEIR MOVIE CONTROLLER
RIGHT
SURE
OKAY
RIGHT
MM-HMM
OKAY GREAT
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT'S THAT
YEAH
OKAY
WELL I MEAN I'M THINKING THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS HAVE SOMETHING THAT KIND OF UNIFIES A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS
AND IF WE THINK THAT WHAT WE ARE W OUR NUMBER ONE MARKETING MOTIVE IS UM THE LOOK AND FEEL
SO FOR THE LOOK AND FEEL TO SEEM COHERENT AND NOT JUST SORTA BITS AND BITS AND PIECES OF OF CONCEPT AND TECHNOLOGY OR OR WHATEVER OR FASHION
THEN WE SHOULD HAVE IT KIND OF COME BACK TO ONE THING THAT WE KIND OF ALL SORTA CAN VISUALIZE
UM MAYBE WHAT WE COULD DO IS T TH THINK ABOUT A CONCEPT WHICH TOUCHES B BACK TO THE ON THE UM THE COLOUR YOU SAID COMPANY COLOUR YELLOW
I MEAN IF WE THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE I WAS SAYING ALSO LIME AND LEMON YOU KNOW
WHAT CAN WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING WHERE WE WE TRY AND ASSOCIATE IT WITH WITH LIKE THE SERIES
WE JUST COME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE KIND OF USE IT AS A THEME TO INSPIRE THE
SHAPES AND THINGS
YEAH
YEAH
NO NO NO NOT AT ALL
IT'S MORE MORE JUST THAT WE WE THINK ABOUT LIKE
WHAT IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SO AND THEN WE HAVE ONE ONE SORTA THEME THAT WE STICK WITH
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
RIGHT SURE
YEAH
UM CAN WE YEAH LIKE TO AND WHA LIKE DO YOU HAVE A
CAN YOU LIKE YEAH JUST T WE CAN VISUALIZE IT
OKAY
OKAY
YEP
MM
WHAT WOULD IT ACHIEVE
WELL
L. C. WELL I'D WHEN YOU USED TO MENTION THE L. C. D. I'D THINK I WONDER WHAT THAT WOULD BE ABOUT
AND THE TH THE THING I COULD SEE IT HELPING WITH WOULD BE IF IT WAS SOMEHOW CONNECTED WITH UM LISTINGS
SO AS YOU SCROLL THROUGH 'CAUSE WE SAID WE MIGHT HAVE A JOG DIAL
SO AS YOU SCROLL THROUGH YOUR STATIONS YOU CAN Y IT ACTUALLY TELLS YOU WHAT IT IS
RIGHT OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM NOT REAL
MM-HMM
NO
MM MM
WELL I I WAS JUST
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SURE
UM I'VE HAD KINETIC THINGS BEFORE
AND THE THE THE ONE ISSUE WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WITH THEM IS THAT YOU'RE COMMITTING THE USER TO MOVING IT AND WATCHES YEAH
SURE OKAY RIGHT OKAY
SUPPORT FOR IT
I MEAN JUST IT'S JUST WORTH POINTING OUT BECAUSE LIKE I'VE I'VE KNOWN I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE TO HAVE KINETIC WATCHES THAT THEY WEAR ALL THE TIME
AND IT'S JUST LIKE MAGIC BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS POWERED AND THERE'S NO BATTERY
I'VE ALSO KNOWN PEOPLE TO HAVE THINGS LIKE LIKE A JEWELLERY WATCH THEY WEAR FROM TIME TO TIME
AND THEY EVENTUALLY JUST SAY IT'S JUST TOO MUCH OF A NUISANCE BECAUSE I DON'T WEAR IT ALL THE TIME
LIKE REMOTE CONTROL IS SIMILAR YOU'RE AWAY ON VACATION I DUNNO WHATEVER YOU SOMETHING AND IT JUST STARTS TO GET WORN DOWN
SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
YEAH
YEP
AND THIS SIZE HERE I'D SUGGEST THIS BE SMALL LIKE QUITE SMALL
UM JUST A A LOT OF THE UM
I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS RUNNING THROUGH MY MIND RIGHT NOW I REALISE WE'RE BEING EFFICIENT TO WRAP UP THE MEETING AND HAVE LOTS OF DECISIONS MADE
UM BUT WE ARE LEANING QUITE A BIT TO THE SIDE OF BEING LOW TECH RUBBER BUTTONS PLASTIC FRAME
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE REPRODUCING THE SAME OLD REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S OUT THERE
SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THIS HIGH TECH USER FRIENDLY UH UM THEME LIKE WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE U WE'RE USING TO TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS
LIKE
OKAY SO SO BACKLIGHTING THAT WOULD BE GOOD
YEAH CLEAR THAT'D BE
OKAY
YEAH SURE
YEAH THAT'D BE REALLY GOOD
YEAH
SURE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SURE
YEAH THEY THEY EMANATE A LIGHT THROUGH IT
'KAY
YEAH MM-HMM
UM AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT WE WE'RE S WE'VE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO ACHIEVING IS SIMPLICITY
AND SO I'M THINKING MAYBE SHOULD WE TRY AND THINK ABOUT HAVING SOMETHING LIKE UM SOME KIND OF AN INNOVATIVE CONCEPT ABOUT HOW THE UM THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNELS ARE CONTROLLED
'CAUSE THAT'S THE MAIN THING PEOPLE WILL F WANNA DO
COULD WE USE LIKE A JOG DIAL LIKE A NICE JUST SORT OF ROUND SOMEWHERE ON IT WHERE YOU JUST ROLL IT
OR
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL WHY DON'T WE DO IT LIKE A MOUSE THEN
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH SURE
MM
YEAH
BUT THAT'S NOT A BAD THING IS IT
BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO GO PUSH THE BUTTON
JOG DIALS ARE MUCH EASIER THAN THAT
YOU JUST ROLL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH LIKE I MEAN IF WE IF IF WE KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS BOARD HERE
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE COULD TAKE THIS IDEA IMAGINE THAT I DUNNO THAT IT'S WITHIN THE SHAPE OF THE HAND IT'S QUITE SMALL
I DUNNO
YEAH
IT'S SMALL AND THAT WE'VE GOT LIKE THE THE L SLOGAN SOMEWHERE LIKE ON THE CASING AT THE SIDE
AND THAT YEAH WELL I MEAN ISN'T THAT WHAT WE JUST H SAID SAID WE S JUST HAVE TO DECIDE NOW
YEAH
AND THEN LIKE A JO
AND THEN LIKE A JOG DIAL SOMEWHERE THAT FITS IN WITH THE SHAPE OF IT LIKE I DUNNO LIKE HERE IN WITH THE
IT WOULD GET BUMPED IT'S DOESN'T REALLY FIT WITH YOUR HAND
YEAH
OR MAYBE JUST FIT IT IN LIKE DOWN THE MIDDLE HERE
A JOG DI
YEAH
IT'S KIND OF YEAH
YEAH
HUH
UM
YEAH I THINK THE JOG DIAL YOU KNOW IT JUST AFTER YOU DREW THAT WHAT IF IT WAS FLAT AND YOU JUST SPUN IT THAT'D BE GREAT
YEAH
YEP
SURE YEAH YEAH AND MATERIALS WE SORTA SAID WE'D DO PLASTIC AND RUBBER DIDN'T WE
AND I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY AND STAY AWAY FROM JUST THE BIG PROTRUDING RUBBER BUTTONS 'CAUSE THAT'D JUST BE SO STANDARD
SOMETHING A BIT MORE FLUSH YEAH OR MAYBE HAVE RUBBER INCORPORATED INTO THE CASE AS WELL
SO THAT IT HAS AND ALSO T PLASTIC I'VE SEEN CAN GET REALLY TEXTURED SO YOU CAN GET PLASTICS THAT ACTUALLY FEEL SOFT IN YOUR HAND
THEY FEEL KIND OF LIKE UM YOU GET PENS NOW AND THEN THAT YOU'D THINK THAT THEY WERE RUBBER BUT THEY'RE NOT
THEY'RE ACTUALLY JUST PLASTIC THAT'S TEXTURED KIND OF A LITTLE BIT LIKE
OKAY
OKAY
NO
NINJA HOMER MADE IN JAPAN
AND THERE ISN'T UH D IT DOESN'T OPEN UP TO THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
SO THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS ARE STILL HIDDEN FROM YOU BUT THEY'RE HIDDEN IN THE SENSE THAT UM THEY'RE NOT IN USE
UM THEY'RE IN THE L. C. D. PANEL AND THE JOG DIAL
OKAY 'CAUSE
THE L. C. D. PANEL JUST DISPLAYS UM FUNCTIONALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IF YOU'RE USING AN ADVANCED FUNCTION RIGHT LIKE UM C BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST WHATEVER IT WILL JUST SAY YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE IT ONLY HAS FOUR COLUMNS
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE L. C. D. LIKE WHEREAS MANY THE MINIMUM AMOUNT WE NEED THAT THE USER WILL AUTOMATICALLY KNOW LIKE THIS IS BRIGHTNESS OR THIS IS CONTRAST
IT MIGHT EVEN BE ONE A BIT MORE COMPLEX L. C. D. PANEL WITH PICTURES LIKE MAYBE THE SUN OR THE
YOU KNOW THE THE SYMBOLS OF THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS
THAT'S A NUMBER PAD
UM THEY'RE AL ALONG THIS YEAH
YOU HAVE THIS SPACE HERE AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS THING ON THE SIDE AS WELL OR AT THE BOTTOM
'CAUSE SLOGANS ARE USUALLY QUITE SMALL RIGHT THEY'RE NOT LIKE HUGE SO THEY'RE S
SAY A BUTTON'S ABOUT SAY A BUTTON'S ABOUT THIS SIZE RIGHT SO YOU WOULD STILL HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE FOR A SLOGAN SAY EVEN FOR THAT
YEP SO THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A CENTIMETRE FOR A BUTTON SO ONE TWO THREE
FOUR CENTIMETRES
PLUS MAYBE HALF O FIVE
SIX SEVEN EIGHT ABOUT YEAH NINE TOTAL
NINE TEN
YEP
EXCUSE ME
SURE
OH WE'VE DISCUSSED HOW H HIGH IT IS BUT HOW WIDE IS IT
NO AS IN THE HEIGHT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WIDTH
DO WE NEED FIVE
I DON'T THINK FIVE IS BE ABOUT TH THREE AND A HALF
YEAH YEAH
OKAY THINGS LIKE UM BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST UM MAYBE TUNING THE CHANNELS
UM
WHAT ELSE
UM THE VARIOUS INPUTS
ARE YOU HAVING A V. C. R. ARE YOU HAVING YOU KNOW WHICH INPUT DO YOU HAVE
UM
YEP COLOUR SHARPNESS
UM A LOT OF THESE THINGS WILL HAVE TO BE UM FREE AND OPEN FOR USERS TO DEFINE THEM
AUDIO WE HAVE LIKE YOUR BASIC Y YOUR BASE YOUR MID RANGE YOUR HIGH RANGE
UM
YEP LEFT RIGHT BALANCE UM MAYBE EVEN PRE PROGRAMMED SOUND MODES
LIKE UM THE USER COULD DETERMINE LIKE A SERIES OF SOUND MODES
AND THEN WHAT COULD HAPPEN WOULD BE UM WHEN YOU CLICK ON THAT THEN IT WOULD GO TO THAT SETTING
YEAH
THE BATTERY
NO
UM
WE NEED AN
YEP
YEAH ADVANCED CHIP
WE NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP I THINK YEP
LET ME JUST CONFIRM THAT
YES I THINK SO
YEP
YEAH
YEP
PLASTIC
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SKIP THE RUBBER
UM
YEP
FOR THE CASE ITSELF ONE COLOUR
IT'S ONE SPECIAL COLOUR
'CAUSE THE CASE UNIT ITSELF THE REST OF OUR COMPONENTS GO ON TOP OF IT
YES
ONE AND THE L. C. DISPLAY
HOW MANY
WE'VE GOT PUSH BUTTONS AS WELL
OKAY LET'S JUST BE SAFE AND PUT LIKE SAY FOUR BUTTONS FOR THAT ONE
OKAY UM AND MAYBE A SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS SO MAYBE FOUR AGAIN
'CAUSE THAT'S ONE BUTTON BY ITS THE COMPLEXITY OF TWELVE BUTTONS
SO WE'RE JUST ESTIMATING THAT YEAH IT WOULD BE LESS
NO
YEP
YEP
HOW MUCH WOULD THAT SAVE US
THAT WILL ONLY SAVE YOU ONE
THE OTHER THING COULD BE THAT UM YOU COULD TAKE AWAY THE L. C. D. PANEL AND THE ADVANCED CHIP TOGETHER UM BECAUSE WHEN YOU
DO SOMETHING ON THE T. V. THE T. V. RESPONDS AND REACTS AS WELL
SO THE USER COULD BE LOOKING AT THE T. V. AND PUSHING HIS THING SO WE MAY NOT NEED TO SO WHEN WE SCROLL WE NEED JUST SOME WAY TO GET THE T. V. TO RESPOND
WHICH I THINK IS A TECHNICALLY DOABLE THING SO
YEP
AND THE ADVANCED CHIP GOES AWAY AS WELL
REGULAR CHIP
YEP
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT UM
THE TWELVE BUTTONS THAT YOU SEE THERE
FUNCTIONALLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO INTERCEPT SO FOUR IS A GOOD ESTIMATE FOR
YEAH SO YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY CUT IT'S LIKE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS FOUR EIGHT TWELVE
IT IT NEEDS TO BE MORE THAN ONE BIG BUTTON BECAUSE IF YOU OPEN UP YOUR PHONE
UNDERNEATH THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE BUTTON UNDERNEATH IT'S JUST THAT THE PANEL ITSELF IS A SINGLE PANEL
WE JUST REPORT THAT IT HAS TO BE OVER BUDGET OR THE COLOURS YOU COULD TAKE AWAY S COLOURS FOR TH FOR THE BUTTONS
NORMAL COLOURED BUTTONS
NO THAT'S NOT THE BUTTON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THAT'S THE BUTTONS ONLY REFER TO THE PAD SO
SHOULD WE TAKE THAT OFF UH
HEY IT'S BACK TO THE ORIGINAL
UM SO THEN THESE JUST BECOME NORMAL COLOURED BUTTONS SO THAT MIGHT BE SOME SOME WAY OF CUTTING THE COST
YEAH
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PROFILE
NO
WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PLAY DOH TO MAKE IT THREE D.
SO THERE'S ONE MORE DIMENSION TO THE THING WHICH WE NEED TO TO ADD
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD IN THE REPORT LENGTH WIDTH AND HEIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
TWO
THIS IS ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT TWO
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TWO SO
OKAY
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY HARD TO CATCH SO YOU YOU RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WANNA TRY SOMETHING
THE THE LOOK AND THE COLOUR IS SOMETHING WHICH IS COOL
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO THAT FACTOR OF IF IT'S TOO UNFAMILIAR THEN UM BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE SHELF
YEAH BUTTON SHAPE MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO CHANGE RATHER THAN RATHER THAN POSITIONING
'CAUSE I THINK POSITIONING IS WE'RE KINDA ENGRAINED INTO THE THE TELEPHONE KIND OF
PAD
MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THE DESIGN EVALUATION FIRST
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED THE POWER SO
NO THAT'S OKAY THAT'S OKAY
NO THE POWER CORD ITSELF
YEAH SO THEN YOU HAVE A BIT MORE FREEDOM TO
YOU YOU STILL HAVE YOUR BLUE FINGERS
YOU KILLED A MONSTER
I RATE THAT PRETTY HIGHLY
YEP I'M FINE WITH THAT
IT'S ONE TO SEVEN RIGHT
WAIT WHAT'S THE SCALE ONE TO SEVEN RIGHT
OKAY IT'S UPSIDE DOWN
SAY IT'S MORE
MEDIUM BUT GOING TOWARDS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN MEDIUM KIND OF THING
YEP
LEMON
OKAY THE BLUE THE BLUE COLOURS AND DON'T RE DON'T ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE COLOUR
EXCEPT FOR THE B THE THE RED BUTTON THEY BECAUSE FOR WANT OF A
YEAH THE THE YELLOW IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COLOUR BUT THE BUTTON ITSELF THE BLUE CAN BE ANYTHING ELSE
YEP THAT'S FINE
YEAH COMPANY LOGO
I THINK IT'LL BE COST PROHIBITIVE YEAH
YEP
THE CAMERAS DID
YEP
IT KEEPS GETTING TOO BIG
'KAY I'M I'M LISTENING I'M JUST TRYING TO INCORPORATE THE LOGO INTO THE THE THING SO I'M PLAYING WITH THE PLAY DOH AS WELL
JUST IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING WHY IS HE STILL PLAYING WITH THE PLAY DOH
JUST ABOUT RIGHT L. E. G. O. LEGO
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE CAGED WITHIN WHATEVER Y IT'S LIKE A BALLOON IN A CAGE IT CAN ONLY GO SO BIG AND NOT HIT THE SIDE
THE CONSTRAINTS DO COME IN VERY FAST
YEAH
I THINK ANOTHER POINT IS THAT THE MEETINGS UM ARE MORE BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS THAN MEETINGS SO TIME IS ALSO A VERY S UM STRONG FACTOR AND STRUCTURE
BECAUSE FOR A BRAINSTORMING MEETING YOU WANT A STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ALLOWS IDEAS TO GET TOSSED
UM TO BE EVALUATED AND TO BE REVIEWED AND TO GET FEEDBACK AND COME BACK
AND I GUESS THAT POINT ABOUT THE ROOM NOT BEING R VERY FRIENDLY TO THAT I THINK THAT'S A VERY BIG THING
AND I THINK THE FACT THAT WE'RE WEARING THESE THINGS RESTRICTS I FEEL IT 'CAUSE I WEAR M MY GLASSES
RIGHT AND THAT BUT THAT IRRITATES ME RIGHT IT IT IT DOES ACTUALLY YOU KNOW AFFECT HOW W WHETHER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE TO COMMUNICATE
I FEEL LIKE I'M HIDING BEHIND THE EQUIPMENT RATHER THAN THE EQUIPMENT IS HELPING ME AND YOU KNOW
NOT NOT SO MUCH AN ATMOSPHERE THE ATMOSPHERE IS VERY RELAXED
BUT THE THE GEAR YEAH YOU KNOW THAT CREATES BOUNDARIES TO THAT UM AND AND THE TIME THE TIME GIVEN ALSO RESTRICTS
EXCUSE ME
I THINK CONTROLLING IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD I THINK THE INTERACTIONS ARE VERY STRUCTURED
I THINK STRUCTURE IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL IS STRUCTURED TO ONE PARTICULAR TASK AND ONE PARTI RATHER THAN CONTROLLING
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A SENSE OF CONTROL 'CAUSE ALL THE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF A
LIKE A CONSENSUS RIGHT WE GO AROUND AND WE THINK ABOUT IT
BUT THAT YOU KNOW PROCESS ACTUALLY SAYS YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN A CERTAIN WAY
IT DOESN'T TELL YOU YOU KNOW SOME WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA BE A BIT MORE CREATIVE IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS YOU KNOW NOT THE
I THINK YOU TRIED TO USE THE COMMON SHARE FOLDER TO TO TO TO COMMUNICATE
BUT UM IT JUST COMES BACK TO US SO SLOW IN THE EMAIL UM IT IT DOESN'T HAVE A YOU KNOW A MESSENGER WILL GO
YEAH
OKAY
I THINK THE TOOLS THAT THEY WERE GIVEN THE TOOL SET THAT WERE GIVEN TO US ARE FANCY BUT THEY DON'T SUPPORT COLLABORATION I THINK THAT'S THE WORD
THEY DON'T SUPPORT THE TEAM WORKING TOGETHER YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL VERY INDIVIDUAL TOOLS
WE HAD PLAY DOH FUN
NO NOT REALLY
I THINK UM THE THE FOCUS OF IT A LOT WAS THE POWERPOINT AS OPPOSED TO THE TO THE WHITEBOARD
AND I THINK THAT M UM IS ALSO DOES YOU KNOW HINDER US AND THINGS I THINK
IT WILL BE COOLER TO HAVE THE WHITEBOARD RATHER THAN THE THE POWERPOINT
OR MAYBE THE WHITEBOARD AND THE POWERPOINT IN THE SAME PLACE YOU KNOW IN THE CENTRE OF THE
I THINK THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY POWERPOINTS IN THE MEETINGS
'CAUSE THE PLUG IN AND THE PLUGGING SPENT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOING THAT
AND A LOT OF THE INFORMATION ON THE POWERPOINTS I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WE NEEDED TO ACTUALLY IT COULD HAVE
WE COULD HAVE GONE THROUGH IT VERBALLY ESPECIALLY MY SLIDES I FELT THAT THEY JUST YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO PRESENT THEM
YEP CLUNKY
AGREED
HAVING TO TICK IT BEFORE YOU GO OFF WAS A BIT HINDERING AS WELL
'CAUSE YOU'RE HALF WAY THROUGH A THOUGHT AND THEN YOU RUN OUT OF PAPER AND THEN YOU HAVE TO JUMP
BUT I THINK THE PEN IS V IS VERY INTUITIVE EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO USE IT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
SO I THINK THE PEN'S GOOD
IT'S ABOUT THE BEST THING
YEAH WE ONLY NEEDED ONE COMPUTER AND
AND THE COMPUTER MAY NOT UM BE CONDUCIVE TO A MEETING BECAUSE UM YOU TEND TO LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTER AND WANNA HAVE THE URGE TO CHECK SOMETHING
YOU KNOW IT'S USEFUL BUT
I THINK TOO MANY COMPUTERS ARE JUST DISTRACTING
UM
YEP
AND WE HAVE NINJA HOMER
NINJA HOMER
SEE IT LOOKS LIKE HOMER SIMPSON
BUT IT'S ELECTRONIC SO IT'S MADE IN JAPAN
YEAH IT'S JUST A LOGO
NINJA HOMER
THE THE RED IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT THE WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANNA PRINT ON THE SIDE OF IT
YOU CAN WEAR HOMER YOU CAN THROW HOMER WHEN YOU'RE FRUSTRATED DOH
IT'S CLUNKY
OH I DID LEARN SOMETHING NEW PLAY DOH IS USEFUL
NO IT IS IT IS
IT IS USEFUL AND IN IN IN IN IN IN IN UM CONCEPTUALIZING IN BEING CREATIVE
'CAUSE LIKE YOU SAY IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN PUT YOUR HANDS ON AND FEEL AND TOUCH AND GET A SENSE FOR
LIKE WE WERE PLAYING WITH THE PLAY DOH AND THE IDEAS CAME WITH THE PLAY DOH RATHER THAN WITH EVERYTHING ELSE
YOU MIGHT WANNA WRITE THAT DOWN
IT'S JUST I'M JUST FIDDLING WITH THE PLAY DOH AND I'M GOING YEAH YEAH IT'S KINDA COOL
NO ALL PLAY DOH IS EDIBLE
IT'S JUST WHEAT IT'S THE STUFF THAT YOUR MOM COULD MAKE WITH PRESERVATIVES AND UH
IT'S HELPFUL TO THE CREATIVE PROCESS
UM IT ENGAGES ALL YOUR SENSES NOT JUST YOUR SIGHT BUT YOUR SENSE OF FEEL YOUR SENSE OF TOUCH
AND IT HELPS YOU TO UNDERSTAND
DIMENSION AS WELL
I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT IT STARTS TO POP UP WHEREAS ON A PIECE OF PAPER ON A COMPUTER ON A BOARD
UM EVEN WITH A THREE D. GRAPHIC THING IT STILL IT REQUIRES A LOT OF YEAH TANGIBLE THAT'S A NICE WORD
IT BECOMES TANGIBLE
NOPE
I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY DO IT HERE AS LONG AS WE DON'T COLLABORATE
CAN WE TURN OFF THE MICROPHONES
OKAY WE ALL ALL SET
RIGHT
WELL THIS IS THE UH FINAL DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
UM WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND WE'RE GONNA EVALUATE THE PRODUCT
AND THE END RESULT OF THIS MEETING HAS TO BE A DECISION ON THE DETAILS OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL LIKE ABSOLUTE FINAL DECISION
UM AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO SPECIFY THE FINAL DESIGN IN THE FINAL REPORT
SO UM JUST FROM FROM LAST TIME TO RECAP WE SAID WE WERE GONNA HAVE A SNOWMAN SHAPED REMOTE CONTROL WITH NO L. C. D. DISPLAY NO NEED FOR TALK BACK
IT WAS HOPEFULLY GONNA BE KINETIC POWER AND BATTERY UH WITH RUBBER BUTTONS MAYBE BACKLIGHTING THE BUTTONS WITH SOME INTERNAL L. E. D. S TO SHINE THROUGH THE CASING
UM HOPEFULLY A JOG DIAL AND INCORPORATING THE SLOGAN SOMEWHERE AS WELL
ANYTHING I'VE MISSED
OKAY UM SO UH IF YOU WANT TO PRESENT YOUR PROTOTYPE GO AHEAD
OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
SO W WHAT KIND OF THING UH IS GONNA BE
MM-HMM
OKAY COOL
OH RIGHT OKAY
COOL
WHERE ARE WE GONNA HAVE THE SLOGAN
OKAY COOL
OKAY
OKAY
SO IF THIS ISN'T TO SCALE WHAT KIND OF
DIMENSIONS ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT HERE
MM-HMM
SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN CENTIMETRES
THAT WOULD BE GOOD
SO TEN CENTIMETRES IN HEIGHT
OKAY UM
YEAH
THAT'S GREAT AND IT'S VERY BRIGHT AS WELL
SO UM OKAY
OKAY SO JUST COULD YOU JUST LIST ALL THE THINGS THAT IT DOES S SO I CAN WRITE THEM IN THE REPORT
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY SO THAT'S LIKE AN OKAY BUTTON RIGHT
OKAY
OH OH LIKE DEPTH OF THE ACTUAL THING
OH IS THIS K TO GET AN IDEA OF SCALE FROM YOUR FROM YOUR THING THERE OKAY
SO YOU CAN POWER ON AND OFF WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO
OKAY
OKAY JOG DIAL FOR VOLUME
AND WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO WITH THE JOG DIAL
CONTRAST BRIGHTNESS YEAH AND ANYTHING ELSE
WELL OF THE DESIGNERS WHAT ARE THEY
UH-HUH
OKAY CHANNEL TUNING
THAT'S A GOOD ONE
OKAY AUXILIARY INPUTS
SHARPNESS
OKAY WHAT ABOUT UH SOUND SETTINGS
UH D CAN YOU CHANGE ANY OF THOSE AT ALL
OKAY
OKAY IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL IT CAN DO
THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S THAT'S FINE
JUST NEED TO KNOW SO I CAN WRITE IT DOWN
OKAY UM RIGHT I G I GUESS THAT'S IT SO WE CAN NOW UM
WE CAN NOW HAVE A LITTLE LOOK AT THE
THE EXCEL SHEET AND PRICE LISTING AND SEE IF WE NEED TO
UM IF WE NEED TO RETHINK ANYTHING AT ALL
SO UM FOR THIS FIRST PART HERE POWER WISE HAVE WE GOT BATTERY
DO WE HAVE KINETIC AS WELL
NO
OKAY JUST BATTERY
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF COST RESTRAINTS IS IT
OKAY UM WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTRONICS HERE
ADVANCED CHIP
OKAY UM THE CASE WHAT DOES IT MEAN BY SINGLE AND DOUBLE DO YOU KNOW
SO WE WANT DOUBLE CURVED
OKAY
UM
IS THERE ANY RUBBER AT ALL IN THE BUTTONS OR ANY
OKAY UM AND WE WANTED SPECIAL COLOURS DIDN'T WE
SO I'LL HAVE TO PUT THAT OH NO WAIT WE HO HOW MANY COLOURS HAVE WE GOT THERE
JUST ONE COLOUR OKAY
OKAY SO INTERFACE WISE IS IT THIS THIRD OPTION WE HAVE THE TWO OF THEM THERE
OKAY AND THEN BUTTONS WE HAVE WHAT TWO COLOURS
LIKE UH OH WAIT SO PUSH BUTTON AND INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH OKAY
UH-HUH
OKAY
OKAY
FOUR
SO W WHY ARE WE ARRIVING AT THE NUMBER FOUR
WHERE DOES THE NUMBER FOUR COME FROM
OKAY RIGHT SO WE'RE WRITING DOWN FOUR
OKAY
HOW ABOUT THESE
ARE WE WANTING THEM IN NO THEY'RE JUST IS EVERYTHING GONNA BE PLASTIC
OKAY
SO WE'RE W W QUITE FAR OVER
NOW WE'RE GONNA SOMETHING'S GONNA HAVE TO GO
UM WE'RE AT SIXTEEN POINT EIGHT AND
WELL WE H SOMETHING HAS TO GO TO THE TUNE OF TWO POINT T THREE EURO
SO LET ME SEE WHAT ARE WE I MEAN OH YES SORRY FOUR POINT THREE
MY MATHS IS ALL OUT
YEAH
HOW MUCH WOULD THAT SAVE US
ONE
OKAY SO
SO W WHAT'S OUR REVIEWED SUGGESTION
UM TAKE AWAY THE L. C. DISPLAY
TO BE REPLACED WITH A REGULAR CHIP
OKAY
AND SO WE'VE GOT POINT THREE TO GET RID OF
UM AND WE HA WHERE ARE THE FOUR THE FOUR PUSH BUTTONS ARE WHERE EXACTLY NOW
TWELVE BUTTONS
YEAH
DO YOU THINK
LIKE IS IS THAT ONE BIG BUTTON OR IS IT TWELVE BUTTONS HOW CAN IT BE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN
MM
OKAY WELL WE HAVE POINT THREE TO GET RID OF SOMEWHERE
MM
NO CAN DO
WELL DO YOU WANT COLOUR DIFFERENTIATION HERE
OH YEAH SORRY YEAH THEN
RIGHT SO
AH
THAT'S IT
OKAY ACH THAT'S A SHAME
UM RIGHT SO TAKE AWAY THAT COMPLETELY
AH
AND NOW WE'RE UNDER BUDGET
SO WE DO HAVE POINT FIVE EURO TO PLAY WITH IF WE WANTED
UM
DOESN'T SAY SO
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
JUST ONE
DOES THAT MEAN THAT ONE BUTTON HAS A SPECIAL FORM OR
YEAH OKAY
WELL WELL THERE WE GO
SO I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO REDRAW THIS NOW
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE L. C. D. ANYMORE AND WE'LL JUST GONNA HAVE AN ON T ON THE T. V. IT'LL SHOW YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING
WHICH I THINK IS FAIR ENOUGH AND SO THIS IS GONNA BE ONE BIG THING HERE
UM
RIGHT OKAY
SO JUST TO WELL TO BE THOROUGH THEN WIDTH WISE WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT WHAT THREE CENTIMETRES OR SOMETHING
OKAY AND THEN SO HEIGHT WISE
HOW HOW TALL DO YOU ENVISAGE IT BEING
ABOUT THAT BIG
ABOUT TWO CENTIMETRES OKAY
OKAY
ACH THAT IS YEAH
OKAY WE'LL S WE'LL SAY TWO POINT FIVE
OKAY UM SO WE HAVE IT WITHIN COST ANYWAY
UM SO YEAH PROJECT EVALUATION IS THIS POINT
UM
RIGHT UH
OKAY SO CAN WE CLOSE THAT
THIS IS WHAT IT'S THE FINAL SPEC THAT IT'S GONNA BE
SOMEONE IS GONNA HAVE TO YEAH THAT'S FINE THAT'S FINE
OKAY
RIGHT UM
SO AT THIS POINT WE UH LET ME SEE DISCUSS UH HOW SATISFIED WE ALL ARE WITH UM
WITH THESE FOUR POINTS WITH THE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY IN THE PROJECT AND LEADERSHIP AND TEAMWORK AND THE STUFF WE HAD AROUND US I GUESS
UM LET ME SEE UH
YEAH I WASN'T REALLY SURE WHAT THAT WAS
YEAH YEAH GO FOR THAT FIRST
I WASN'T ENTIRELY SURE WHAT UH WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THAT BUT Y YOU GO FOR IT
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OH THERE IT IS
MM 'KAY
OKAY
WELL YEAH I MEAN COMPARED TO MOST REMOTE CONTROLS YOU SEE THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
I DUNNO LIKE A SIX OR SOMETHING
WHAT DOES ANYBODY ELSE THINK
MM
MM
OKAY
I WOULD SAY FIVE OR SIX
DAVID
OKAY
OH YES SORRY THEN THEN I WOULD SAY TWO OR THREE
YEAH
WELL IT HAS THE WEE JOG DIAL BUT
MM
I'D GO WITH THREE OR FOUR MAYBE THREE
YEAH ABOUT THREE OKAY
WELL THAT'S KIND OF
BUT THE YELLOW I MEAN IT COULD BE A LEMON YELLOW COLOUR COULDN'T IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL YEAH I MEAN IT'S REALLY BASIC LOOKING ISN'T IT
I MEAN I'D GIVE THAT NEARLY A ONE
FIVE
THAT'S REALLY LOW
WELL
YEAH I SUPPOSE MM 'KAY
YEP
GONNA HAVE THAT ON THE SIDE AREN'T WE LIKE THERE OR SOMETHING
OUT OF FORTY NINE I GUESS
'S PRETTY GOOD
UH YEAH
TWICE THAT ABOUT THIRTY ONE
SO YEAH AB WELL YEAH ABOUT SIXTY NINE SEVENTY PERCENT YEAH
IT'S PRETTY GOOD
OKAY
NOBODY SAW IT HONESTLY
IS THAT YOU ALL HAVE ALL FINISHED OR
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
OKAY GREAT UM ARE YOU SUBMITTING THE
THE UM EVALUATION CRITERIA OR AM I
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR INSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN
OKAY UH JUST WONDERING IF I NEED TO INCLUDE IT IN THE MINUTES BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SUBMITTING IT ANYWAY THEN OKAY GREAT
COOL
UM RIGHT UH WELL NEXT UP THEN BECAUSE WE'VE DONE FINANCE IS THE PROJECT EVALUATION
OH RIGHT OKAY
RIGHT OKAY
UM WELL DO YOU WANNA UM JUST INDIVIDUALLY SAY WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ABOUT THESE FOUR POINTS AND OR NOT THOSE FOUR POINTS
MY FOUR POINTS SORRY FORGOTTEN THAT
YOU GOT A DIFFERENT UH
OH YEAH THEY'RE GOOD AREN'T THEY YEAH
RIGHT OKAY UM YEAH HERE WE ARE
UH AS A NOTE WE'LL DO THIS
ALPHABETICALLY
UM DO YOU WANNA START ANDREW
I DON'T KNOW JUST UM YOUR OPINION ON THOSE FOUR THOSE FOUR POINTS REALLY AND HOW WE USED THEM
YEAH
UH-HUH
WELL D DO YOU FEEL THOUGH THAT THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO HAVE QUITE A LOT OF CREATIVE INPUT INTO THE THING
BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT MEANS THE ROOM AS IN THIS ROOM
I THINK IT MEANS LIKE YOU KNOW
YEAH
ROOM
OH YEAH
WELL I DUNNO DO YOU TH I THINK IT MEANS UM I THINK IT MEANS DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE ABLE TO GIVE CREATIVE INPUT SO
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY UH DO YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY LET'S TAKE EACH POINT AND EVERYBODY DISCUSS IT I THINK
YEAH
SO STILL ON THE TOPIC OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY UH NEXT UP IS CRAIG
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
SO YOU THINK A MORE RELAXED ATMOSPHERE WOULD BE MORE KIND OF CONDUCIVE TO CREATIVE THOUGHT OR
YEAH BUT ACTUAL ENVIRONMENT
OKAY
OKAY
VERY GOOD
UM WHAT ABOUT LEADERSHIP
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS LIKE IF I DID A GOOD JOB OR SOMETHING
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
FROM LIKE YOUR PERSONAL COACH PERSON AND STUFF LIKE THAT DO YOU THINK MAYBE
OKAY
MM-HMM
UH-HUH OKAY
SO YOU THINK MAYBE A LITTLE TOO CONTROLLING OR
OKAY
UH-HUH
OKAY
OKAY UH WHAT ABOUT TEAMWORK
YEAH
OKAY
MM
DID UH DID YOU GUYS GET THE EMAIL I SENT YOU
OH THAT'S ALRIGHT
I WAS WONDERING IF THAT GOT THERE OKAY
OKAY UM SO UM TO S TO TO SUMMARIZE THE TEAMWORK ISSUE SAYING THAT IF WE COULD COMMUNICATE OUTSIDE THE MEETING
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE QUICK QUESTIONS QUICK THOUGHTS WHATEVER IT PROBABLY WOULD BE BIT EASIER
OH RIGHT OKAY
MM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT UH ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY ON TEAMWORK AT ALL
OKAY UM WHAT ABOUT THE YOU KNOW HOW WE USED THE WHITEBOARD THE DIGITAL PENS THE PROJECTOR STUFF LIKE THAT
UM DID ANYBODY THINK ANYTHING WAS LIKE REALLY USEFUL ANYTHING WAS PRETTY UN F
UNSUPPORTIVE
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND POINT AT
YEAH
YEAH
AH
SO DO YOU THINK PRODUCING A PROTOTYPE EARLIER IN THE PROCESS WOULDA BEEN A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
OKAY
ALRIGHT
OKAY UH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
WHAT ABOUT THE DIGITAL PENS DID YOU FIND THEM EASY ENOUGH TO USE
YEAH
CLUNKY OKAY
UM
YEAH
I KNOW I THINK AT THE VERY START OF TODAY I LIKE WROTE A WHOLE LOAD OF STUFF
DIDN'T CLICK NOTE ON ONE THEN WENT BACK AND WROTE ONE TINY WEE THING ON THE ANOTHER PAGE
BUT THEN DID CLICK NOTE AND SO I'M QUITE WORRIED THAT I'VE JUST WRITTEN OVER THE TOP OF IT OR SOMETHING
BUT THEY'LL HAVE MY PAPER ANYWAY UM AND HAVEN'T DONE THAT SINCE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
DO YOU THINK THE COMPUTERS JUST PROVIDE DISTRACTION IN A MEETING
OKAY
I KNOW I I LIKE TO HAVE THINGS WRITTEN DOWN IN FRONT OF ME ACTUALLY

YEAH I I DUNNO I THINK IT WAS QUITE GOOD THAT WE HAD TIME LIMITS ON THE MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY REALLY COULD HAVE RUN ON AND LIKE MY EXPERIENCE WITH MEETINGS IS THAT THEY REALLY DO
AND YOU CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE ONLY THING IS THOUGH LIKE WHEN WE HAD OUR MEETING ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
I THOUGHT THERE MAYBE ANOTHER FIFTEEN MINUTES WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL THERE BUT UM YEAH
I REALLY THI I I THINK MAYBE IF WE'D LIKE ALL BEEN WORKING IN THE ONE ROOM
AND THEY JUST SAID YOU KNOW LIKE EVERY HOUR OR SOMETHING EVERYBODY MAKE SURE YO YOU KNOW JUST HAVE A HAVE A SHORT MEETING AND THEN JUST C JUST TO HAVE LIKE SOMETHING WRITTEN DOWN

RIGHT
RIGHT 'KAY
OKAY
MM-HMM AND WHAT IS THIS HERE

MM
YEP
LOOKS GOOD
YEP
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
ABOUT NINE IN TOTAL
THAT SOUNDS GOOD
YEAH
YEP
THAT'D BE GOOD IN FACT A PEN IS ABOUT TEN CENTIMETRES USUALLY
SO THAT WOULD BE THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GOOD SIZE IF YOU SEE IT THERE
MM
IS IT POSSIBLE UH I'M JUST GONNA BRING UP THE IDEA OF COLOURS
IS THESE ARE THESE THE COLOURS THAT OF PRODUCTION OR IS THIS JUST WHAT WE HAD AVAILABLE
RIGHT
MM-HMM
HOW HIGH IS IT
YEAH
OKAY
SURE
THREE AND A HALF
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM PROBABLY COLOUR OR SHARPNESS
MM-HMM
AUDIO
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
MM
OR EVEN CLEAR
UH HOW MM-HMM HOW ARE WE GOING TO ACHIEVE THIS HIGH END PRODUCT IF
WE ONLY HAVE VERY SPARSE
TWO POINT THREE
FOUR POINT THREE NO
AND THEN WHERE IS THE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH WE COULD JUST GO WITH UM
HMM
MM-HMM
MM
HOW ABOUT WITH EMBOSSING THE LOGO ISN'T THAT GOING TO COST US SOME MONEY
YEAH
THAT'S A FREEBIE
WAS THE GOAL IN YOUR IN YOUR PROTOTYPE DESIGN THAT IT BE AS LOW PROFILE AS POSSIBLE
SORT OF FLAT AS POSSIBLE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING TO SURE OKAY
YEAH ALRIGHT YEAH FAIR ENOUGH
OKAY JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK
MM-HMM
HMM
TWO'S NOT VERY HIGH AT ALL THOUGH
MAYBE A BIT HIGHER
YEAH
MAYBE CLOSER TO THREE EVEN OR TWO AND A HALF
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM IT'S PROBABLY JUST I DUNNO IF IT'S WORTH GETTING INTO
BUT UM JUST IN IN THAT WE WANT THIS TO BE STYLISH SHOULD WE THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF THE BOX IN TERMS OF A BUTTON GRID
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THERE'S LOTS OF DEVICES OUT THERE THAT THAT INSTEAD OF TAKING YOUR STANDARD NINE NINE SQUARE GRID
AND THEY HAVE IT SORT OF STYLIZED OR IN DIFFERENT CONCEPT THAT THAT
YEAH
SURE OKAY
YEAH ALRIGHT
OKAY SURE
WHAT ABOUT BUTTON SHAPE
SQUARE BUTTONS
OKAY
YEAH
SURE
YEAH
MM 'KAY
DO YOU WANT ME TO D UM
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO MY UM DESIGN EVALUATION LAST
OR
EVALUATION
OKAY
SURE
UM ALRIGHT SO THE WAY THIS WORKS I'M GONNA NEED TO PLUG INTO POWERPOINT I'LL TRY AND DO IT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE
UM THIS IS UM I'LL JUST GO OVER YOUR HEAD IF THAT'S OKAY
WHAT'S THAT
I DON'T NEED THE POWERPOINT
OH COURSE YEAH THAT'S TRUE
LET ME GET THAT
A BIT MORE
OKAY SO WHAT THIS IS IS A SET UP FOR US TO UM UH USE A KIND OF A LIKE A
THE IDEA IS THAT I'VE SET UP I'VE REVIEWED ALL OF THE UM THE POINTS OF DISCUSSION FROM THE BEGINNING
AND USED THAT AS A CRITERIA OF EVALUATION FOR THE UM UH FOR THE CURRENT DESIGN UH TH OR THE PLAN AND UH SO WE CAN REVIEW THAT
UH I THINK IT'S GONNA END UP BEING SORT OF ELEMENTARY BECAUSE WE'RE SORT WE'RE IN N WE'RE NOT GONNA PROBABLY USE IT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BUT
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S GOING DOES IT
YEAH OKAY GREAT
UH AND I'M GONNA WRITE UP OUR RESULTS ON THE BOARD
SO THIS'LL BE A WAY FOR US TO GO THROUGH AND DECIDE IF WE'RE UM SORT OF REVIEW WHERE WE STAND WITH IT
OKAY SO UM
SO TO SORT OF B BRING TOGETHER TWO THINGS SORT OF DESIGN GOALS AND ALSO THE MARKET RESEARCH THAT WE HAD UH WHEN WE RATE THIS
ONE IS V HIGH IN IN SUCCEEDING OR FITTING TO OUR ORIGINAL AIM AND SEVEN IS LOW OKAY
SO THESE I THESE I TH ARE THE AND UM WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO UH TO COLLECTIVELY RATE THIS
SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRY AND JUST Y WORK ON A CONSENSUS SYSTEM SO
WE JUST COME TO AN AGREEMENT
OKAY
SO THE FIRST ONE UH STYLISH LOOK AND FEEL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH UM ME UH MY ONLY RESERVATION WITH IT WAS THAT WE BASICALLY WENT WITH YELLOW BECAUSE IT'S THE COMPANY'S COLOUR
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YELLOW'S GONNA REALLY BE A HIT
BUT
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
OKAY
OKAY LET'S GO WITH FIVE THEN
FI OH UH JUST ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE
THE SO IT MEANT THREE OKAY
YEAH ONE IS HIGH
'KAY
LET'S GO WITH TWO POINT FIVE THEN
OKAY UM CONTROL HIGH TECH INNOVATION
WE HAD TO REMOVE
YEAH SO WE'VE HAD TO REMOVE A FEW OF OUR FEATURES WE WANTED BUT JOG DIAL
'S GOOD
OKAY THREE
OKAY UM
STYLE REFLECTS A FRUIT INSPIRED COLOUR DESIGN
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID COLOUR BUT JUST
SORTA
YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH COULD BE
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY SO WE'LL GO TWO
YEAH
OKAY AND UM DESIGN IS SIMPLE TO USE SIMPLE IN FEATURES
F F YEAH F FAIRLY BASIC YOU GUYS THINK
YEAH ONE
OKAY
UM SOFT AND SPONGY HAVE WE ACHIEVED THAT
WE'VE USED MOSTLY PLASTIC IN THE END SO IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT OF A COMPROMISE FOR PRICE
FIVE
THAT'S
UM
COULD WE HAVE USED AN ENTIRELY RUBBER FRAME TO IT
WAS THAT AN OPTION
IT WOULD COST MORE THAN PLASTIC
OKAY LOGO WE'VE GOT IT IN THERE HAVEN'T WE
HUH
AND UM IT'S WITHIN BUDGET YEP
IT IS ISN'T IT
OKAY SO WE CAN SAY THEN THAT UH OUT OF A POSSIBLE OR WHAT WOULD BE OUR GOAL HERE
YEAH OUT OF FORTY NINE WITH WITH ZERO BEING THE HIGHEST
WE ARE AT UH TWO SEVEN EIGHT TEN FIFTEEN POINT FIVE
SO IT'S PRETTY GOOD
TRANSLATES TO SOMETHING LIKE ABOUT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY TWO PERCENT EFFICACY
OF OUR ORIGINAL GOAL
RIGHT
I THINK 'CAUSE IF YOU TURN THAT INTO
A HUNDRED
IT WOULD BE ABOUT
ABOUT THIRTY ONE AND THEN INVERT THAT IT'S
OH RIGHT ABOUT SEVENTY YEAH SEVENTY PERCENT
OKAY GOOD
THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE FORMALITY FOR US TO GO THROUGH
YEP OH HUNDRED POUND PEN
SORRY ALRIGHT
NO
HMM
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S ME
I DID HAVE ONE OTHER UM ONE OTHER FRAME I THOUGHT I MEAN I I D NOT KNOWING HOW WE WOULD DEAL WITH THIS INFORMATION
I THOUGHT OKAY IN THEORY THIS KIND OF A PROCESS WOULD BE ABOUT REFINING OUR DESIGN REVISITING OUR ORIGINAL GOALS
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I NEED TO P PUSH THROUGH BUT I THOUGHT SHOULD WE THINKING MORE ABOUT THE DIMENSIONS
UM SORT OF LIKE MORE OF A THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES AS WELL AS OPPOSED TO JUST THAT FLAT UM
COULD OUR DESIGN INVOLVE A SERIES OF COLOURS SO THAT IT'S MORE OF LIKE A LINE WHERE WE HAVE LIKE SORT OF THE
I DON'T KNOW LIKE THE HARVEST LINE OR THE VIBRANT
I DUNNO THE WHATEVER JUST SOME THEME AND THEN WE HAVE DIFFERENT TONES LIME GREEN LEMON
IT'S JUST DISCUSSION
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE CAN JUST ABANDON THIS IT'S FINE
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE ORIGINALLY SET OUT TO DO
UM YEP SO THERE
THAT'S ALL
UM I THINK TO RECORD IT AND UH I HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED TO SUBMIT IT YET
YEAH
I WILL YEAH
HUH
YEP
I LIKE THOSE PRINTER CABLES THAT JUST HAVE THE TWO LITTLE BUTTERFLY CLIPS LIKE THAT
IT'S REALLY QUICK
TO USE
SURE UM SO WHAT IS IT YOU'RE ASKING OF ME NOW
OR SORT OF OUR WORK ON SETTING THIS UP
YEAH
WELL IS IT UH OKAY I'LL JUST GO THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM THEN
THE THE ROOM UH
IS FAIRLY INSTITUTIONAL BUT UM THE MAIN THING IS I THINK
UM OUR USE OF THIS SPACE IS MORE JUST TO REPORT ON THINGS AS OPPOSED TO BE CREATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE AND IT WOULD PROBABLY HELP TO UM HAVE L SORT OF A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF WE HAVE IDEAS AND WE COME BACK AND THEN THE IDEAS ARE STILL IN DISCUSSION
YOU KNOW AS IN OTHER WORDS THIS THIS ROOM IS SORT OF A CENTRE POINT OF CREATIVITY
WHEREAS IN REALITY AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS IT'S NOT REALLY THE CENTRE POINT OF CREATIVITY IT'S MORE JUST A
D DEBATING
YEAH YEAH BUT THAT'S JUST THE THING IS THE QUEST IN TERMS OF THE THE FIRST POINT THERE THE ROOM
IT FEELS AS THOUGH THE CREATIVITY GOES ON WHEN WE LEAVE
AND THEN WE COME HERE AND THEN WE KIND OF PUT OUT OUR IDEAS AND THEN YOU KNOW
OH OH RIGHT RIGHT OH RIGHT OKAY ROOM FOR CREATIV OH RIGHT I JUST LOOKED UP AND SAW OKAY WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS THE ROOM
NO OF COURSE YEAH
SORRY
HUH
YEAH
YEAH I TH OKAY ON TH UM YEAH DIF ANSWERING THE QUESTION UH IN THOSE TERMS I'D SAY THAT ACTUALLY THERE'S SORT OF A TEASE OF CREATIVITY BECAUSE WE'RE ASKED TO WORK THROUGH THIS
BUT ACTUALLY THE GUIDELINES ARE FAIRLY CONTRIVED IN TERMS OF UM OKAY FASHION TRENDS
SAY FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOUR SCHEME BUT THEN I THEN WE'RE TOLD OKAY USE THE CO COMPANY COMPANY COLOURS
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE'RE TOLD OKAY UM THINK IN TERMS OF STYLE AND LOOK AND FEEL AND TECHNOLOGY BUT BUILD SOMETHING FOR TWELVE AND A HALF POUNDS
SO ACTUALLY THE CREATIVITY WAS MORE MORE OF LIKE A UM A F SORT OF A F FORMALITY THEN AN ACTUAL
YEAH WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS THE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
SO
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SURE
YEAH
NEW CREATIVITY
YEP
RIGHT
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH WELL WELL I MEAN MY SENSE ON THAT IS SORT OF WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION ENCOURAGEMENT
YEAH FROM AND YOU AS WELL I THINK JUST SORT OF ACTING AS TEAM LEADER
UM YEAH I THINK I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S GOOD
I MEAN MY PERSONAL VIEWS ON ON LEADERSHIP IS THAT EFFECTIVE EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP SORT OF UM GIVES PEOPLE A CERTAIN ROOM FOR FREEDOM AND DELEGATION
BUT THEN TO COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT THEY TAKE GREAT OWNERSHIP AND
YOU KNOW INNOVATIVE THOUGHT WITH
IN IN REALITY I THINK HERE THE THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF LEADERSHIP SUCH AS THE THE ORIGINAL B BRIEFING AND THEN THE PERSONAL COACH AND THE AND THEN YOU KNOW HAVING HAVING YOU WITH YOUR THE MEETING AGENDA IS ACTUALLY QUITE A QUITE A QUITE A CON CONFINING FRAMEWORK TO WORK WITHIN
AND SO IT IS LEADERSHIP ALMOST TO THE POINT OF SORT OF DISEMPOWERING THE THE THE TEAM MEMBER SO
BUT IT'S NOT BAD LEADERSHIP IT'S JUST SORT OF S FAIRLY STRONG YOU KNOW
IT TURNS IT TURNS THE INDIVIDUAL INTO MORE OF LIKE A UM SORT OF A PREDETERMINED MECHANISM AS OPPOSED TO A SORT OF A FREE
YEAH OH YEAH WITHOUT WITHOUT A DOUBT
YEAH MAYBE NOT CO CONFINING
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH
UM DID YOU WANNA COMMENT CRAIG
YEAH
YEAH
FULLY AGREE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH GOT THE EMAIL
YEAH
YEAH IN IT
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM EXACTLY
YEAH I MEAN IF YOU
YEAH I MEAN SORT OF TAKING UPON THAT IDEA
W THE WAY I SEE THIS I IS THAT IT'S UH THE THE S THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH WE'VE WE'VE APPROACHED THIS WHOLE TASK IS QUITE CONTRARY TO THE P PRINCIPLE OF TEAMWORK BECAUSE THE THE TASKS WERE D D SORT OF UM DIVIDED
AND THEN THE WORK WENT ON IN ISOLATION I I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS DID WHILE YOU WERE TOGETHER MAYBE THAT WAS A BIT DIFFERENT
BUT UM YEAH BUT UM BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU IF YOU IMAGINE NOT ENTIRE THE COMPLETELY SAME TASK GIVEN TO US BUT US SAID OKAY
FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS COME UP WITH UM LET'S SAY UM A DESIGN CONCEPT
AND WE SIT HERE TOGETHER AND DO IT WELL THAT'S WHAT TEAMWORK IS
TO S TO SAY OKAY GO OFF AND DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER IT'S ACTUALLY P SORT OF PREDISPOSES YOU TO QUITE THE CONTRARY OF TEAMWORK
UM NOT THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE I THINK THE BEST WE COULD HAVE DONE
I'M NOT DISSATISFIED WITH IT
MM-HMM
I THINK THE WHITEBOARD FOR ME IS THE KIND OF THING I WOULD USE ALL THE TIME
BUT IT'S UM NOT QUITE AS USEFUL AS TO US AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE JUST IN THE WAY THAT WE WE USE IT
IN THE SENSE THAT ONCE WE HAVE AN IDEA OUT THERE OR WHILE WORK WAS GOING ON IN BETWEEN MEETINGS
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN UP ON A BOARD UH YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO IN LIKE IN TEXT
UM AND THEN WE COULD THEN KEEP OUR IDEAS SORT OF BUILDING ON THAT
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO DESIGN CARS AND YOU KNOW IN AVIATION THEY QUITE OFTEN JUST HAVE A SIMPLE LIKE FIBREGLASS PROTOTYPE AND IT'S COMPLETELY YOU KNOW UM ABS ABSTRACT FROM THE FINAL PRODUCT
BUT THEY USE IT AS A KIND OF A CONTEXT TO SORT OF WALK AROUND AND PUZZLE AND AND POINT AND DISCUSS AND AND AND IN A WAY EVERYBODY'S AS WE DISCUSS THINGS IN THE IN THEORETICALLY AND OUT OF OUR NOTEBOOKS
WE'RE JUST WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST EACH OF US DISCUSSING SOMETHING THAT'S IN EACH OF OUR OWN MINDS
IT WASN'T UNTIL WE HAD THIS HERE YOU KNOW
LIKE AT ONE POINT I PEEKED ACROSS AND LOOKED AT CRAIG'S PAPER AND I'M LIKE NOW I KNOW WHAT HE'S THINKING 'CAUSE I SAW HIS BOOK
BUT THE B THE B WHITEBOARD COULD'VE ACTUALLY BEEN THIS KIND OF CONTINUING UM
THINK COULD BE YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE THE POWERPOINT WAS PROVIDED TO US WHILE WE HAD TIME TO PREPARE WHEREAS I CAN IMAGINE IF I'D BEEN ENCOURAGED TO USE PAINTBRUSH
FOR EXAMPLE OR WHATEVER I WOULD'VE ACTUALLY USED IT UM 'CA YOU KNOW
JUST 'CAUSE THAT'S SORTA HOW WE WHAT WE WERE SET UP TO TO USE WHILE WE HAD OUR TIME
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO NOT QUITE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SURE YEAH
YEAH
YEP
MM
MM
YEAH
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
AND O ON THE TOPIC OF THE TECHNOLOGY
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T NEED TO MOVE OUR COMPUTERS BECAUSE EACH COMPUTER HAS ALL OF THE FILES
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT THEY ALL
WE ONLY ACTUALLY NEEDED ONE COMPUTER
IF THERE HAD BEEN A FIFTH THAT COULDA JUST BEEN SITTING THERE READY TO GO THE WHOLE TIME
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL THE W MAIN ONE FOR ME IS THAT UH THE PROCESS
NA IN A NATURAL F CONTEXT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THIS NECESSITY TO DISCOMMUNICATE OURSELVES FROM EACH OTHER
SO THAT'S KIND OF A NEW IDEA FOR ME IS LIKE JUST SORT OF THAT IDEA
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF S HARD TO KEEP F WORKING FORWARD ON A TEAM A TEAM BASED PROJECT WHEN WHEN YOU'RE TOLD YOU MUST NOW WORK AWAY FROM YOUR TEAM
OH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
GREAT
SO IT
SO NOW WE
I I DON'T KNOW
HMM
WHAT DID YOU CALL IT
HUH-HUH
LOGO
HUH
MM
MM-HMM
FASHION TECHNOLOGY OR SOMETHING
HMM-HMM HMM
HMM
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
HUH
HUH
YEAH
YEAH
NO IT'S TRUE YEAH
HMM
AND SOME PLAY DOHS ARE ACTUALLY I THINK EDIBLE AREN'T THEY
WOW HMM
HUH
YEP
TASTE
YEAH
MM-HMM YEP
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
DO WE RETREAT TO OUR TO CONTINUE OUR
R REPORTING OR WHAT I
UH OH
THIS IS IT
UM THERE ARE A FEW CHANGES WE'VE MADE
UM WELL LOOK AT THE EXPENSE SHEET
AND UH IT TURNED TO BE QUITE A LOT EXPENSIVE TO HAVE OPEN UP AND HAVE LOTS OF BUTTONS AND STUFF INSIDE
SO INSTEAD WE'VE UM THIS IS GONNA BE AN L. C. D. SCREEN UM JUST A A VERY VERY BASIC ONE
VERY SMALL UM WITH ACCESS TO THE MENU THROUGH THE THE SCROLL WHEEL AND UH CONFIRM
UM BUTTON
UH APART FROM THAT IT'S JUST PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE RIGHT INSIDE THERE
WELL WE WANT THE OTHER BUTTONS TO BE BIG ENOUGH TO PUSH EASILY WITH A FINGER SO WE RECKON MAYBE THAT'LL BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
WELL I'M
WE'RE GONNA HAVE AGAIN THE THE SORT OF THE FOGGY UM YELLOW FROM LAST TIME THAT LIT UP WHEN YOU PUSHED THE BUTTON
UM
BUT UM THIS BUTTON UM BECAUSE IT'S RED IT'S SORT OF VERY PROMINENT
WE'RE GONNA USE IT AS UH IT CAN BE THE POWER BUTTON IF YOU HOLD IT FOR MAYBE TWO SECONDS IT'LL SEND A STAND BY SIGNAL
UM APART FROM THAT IT'S GONNA BE USED AS A CONFIRM BUTTON FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND YOU USE THIS AS A JOG DIAL
I DON'T KNOW
DIDN'T PUT FIVE CENTIMETRES
UM
SOMETHING BY THERE
UM YOU CAN SKIP STRAIGHT TO A CHANNEL USING THESE BUTTONS
UM WERE GONNA HAVE THE VOLUME CONTROL HERE
BUT UM BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE THE L. C. D. AND THE JOG DIAL WE JUST THOUGHT WE'D UM USE THAT AS THE VOLUME
UM YOU CAN USE IT FOR UM MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS LIKE CONTRAST COLOUR AND
UM YEAH
UM JUST WHATEVER ELSE WE WANTED TO INCLUDE AS THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS UM WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY GO THROUGH AND SPECIFY THE
UH WHAT CAN A T. V. DO
UM
THE THE BALANCE HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM I THINK SINGLE WOULD JUST BE SORT OF ONE SORT OF OVAL WHEREAS DOUBLE IS THIS SORT OF THING
UM WE HAVE UM GOT SOME PUSH BUTTONS AS WELL
'KAY
SO I RECKON WE'VE GOT ONE BUTTON FOR THIS THING 'CAUSE IT'S JUST ONE BIG SHEET OF RUBBER
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT COUNTS BUT
YOU CAN SEE WE'RE WE'RE ALL VERY FAR BEYOND THE
WELL WE COULD TAKE OUT ONES BY MAKING IT SINGLE CURVED JUST FILL IN THOSE BITS
THAT IS ONE
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH YEAH
THAT'S UM ONE PIECE OF RUBBER BUT IT'S GONNA HAVE TWELVE BUTTON THINGS UNDERNEATH SO
YEAH W
UM
SO I RECKON
RECKON THAT PROBABLY COUNTS AS A SPECIAL FORM FOR THE BUTTONS
I THINK THERE'S JUST ONE BUTTON SO HANDY
YEAH
YOU SEE I ENVISION IT AS BEING UM QUITE DEEP SORT OF DEEP ENOUGH TO BE COMFY TO HOLD IN YOUR HANDS RATHER THAN BEING WIDE AND FLAT
YEAH IT WORKS YEAH
SEE ABOUT THAT THICK
YEAH
IS IT
YEAH
I'M SEEING FIVE THEN
ONE'S HIGH ISH ISN'T IT
AH OKAY SO YEAH TWO OR THREE
EIGHT THREE
YEAH
YEAH ONE
YEAH I THINK IT'S ABOUT FIVE
YEAH WELL WE HAVE TO USE UH PLASTIC SO IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
I THINK I'D PROBABLY INCREASE THE COST
WE'VE ONLY GOT LIKE WHAT TEN CENTS LEFT SO
YEAH
MY LEG
UM I AGREE WITH HIS POINT IT'S UM IT IS QUITE A LOT OF FUN T TO GO AND THEN YOU HAVE SORT OF HIT THE END THEN GO RIGHT
GOTTA CUT EVERYTHING OUT 'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
UH RECKON THAT WAS A BIT HARD BECAUSE WE COULD ONLY DISCUSS THINGS IN THE MEETING
IF WE COULD JUST GO UP TO SOMEBODY OUTSIDE THE MEETING AND HAVE A QUICK TALK WITH THEM THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT EASIER
NOT JUST YET
YEAH
OH THEY'RE A BIT CLUNKY
GOOD POINT
YEAH
IS THIS FOR THE PROJECT OR
OH YEAH
DO WE KNOW WHAT THE OTHER ONES ARE
OH WOW
HEY YEAH I SAID NINJA HOMER
GUESS I'D FORGOT HOW GOOD S PLAY DOH SMELLS
I THINK THEY'RE ALL NON TOXIC 'CAUSE IT'S AIMED FOR LIKE TWO YEAR OLDS
YEAH IT'S NOT VERY TANGIBLE
UH DAVE COCHRANE
USER INTERFACE DEFIN DESIGNER YES
UM
UM THE MONKEY UM
THE ONE F UH IN FACT THIS IS A SOMEWHAT OBLIQUE REFERENCE IN FACT TO UH WELL MY I HAVE A THREE UH THREE Y YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO H WHO WHO WHO IS AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS MISS MONKEY
UM MONKEYS HAVE ATTITUDE
WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD THING
AND I MEAN FR AND FROM UH FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SORT OF THE STUDY OF HUMAN EVOLUTION THEY AND OTHER PRIMATES ARE TERRIBLY INTERESTING
UM SO I LIKE MONKEYS
AND AND TH TH TH TH THI THI THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE PERHAPS MORE ATTITUDE THAN MOST
WELL ONE THING I'M AWARE OF IS
TH THERE UH UM AT THE SORT OF V VERY HIGH PRICE END OF THE MARKET THERE'S THERE'S A EM EMERGING MARKET FOR SORT OF TOUCH SCREEN L. C. D. REMOTES THAT CAN BE UH PROGRAMMED IN M MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED WAYS THAN SORT OF CONVENTIONAL MODELS
SO YOU GET THE SORT OF YOU GET UM YOU YOU CAN REDESIGN THE INTERFACE TO YOUR OWN NEEDS YOU CAN PROGRAMME IN MACROS
AND YOU GET A MUCH GREATER DEGREE UM UM I MEAN YOU GET IN THESE SORT OF THREE IN ONE FIVE IN ONE WHATEVERS
BUT YOU CAN GET INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT UH THE THE THE DIFF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO CONTROL TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT
AND YOU CAN HAVE ONE UH YOU KNOW ONE MACRO TO TURN THE UH YOU KNOW TURN THE T. V. TO THE RIGHT CHANNEL
GET THE UH RE UH REWIND THE TAPE IN THE V. C. R. AND GET IT TO PLAY ONCE IT'S REWOUND FOR INSTANCE
UM B IT OCCURS TO ME THERE MIGHT BE A NICHE FOR UH FOR A REMOTE THAT AIMED TOWARDS SOME OF THAT SORT OF FUNCTIONALITY BUT USING A JUST CONVENTIONAL PUSH BUTTON DESIGN
AND THEREFORE PUTTING IT INTO A UM WELL MUCH LOWER PRICE BRACKET
ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITIVE YEAH
YEAH I MEAN I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SAY YOU G I MEAN YOU GET ONES THAT YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN MULTIPLE UNITS
BUT SOMETHING THAT COULD UM OPERATE BETWEEN MULTIPLE UNITS IN A MORE INTEGRATED FASHION
SOME AND IDEALLY SOMETHING INTO WHICH IT WOULD HAVE SOME AT LEAST LIMITED FACILITY FOR UM RUNNING MACROS
FOR INSTANCE UM LET'S SAY OH OH UM
OR UM YOU KNOW YOU PR UH YOU PRESS UH SAY THE PLAY BUTTON FOR THE D. V. D. PLAYER AND IT TURNS THE T. V. ON AND ONTO THE RIGHT CHANNEL AS WELL
UM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THE OTHER KEY FEATURE THAT UH THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BUILT INTO IT IS T IS IS TO MAKE SOMETHING YOU KNOW FAIRLY SORT OF ERGONOMIC
SOMETHING THAT JUST FITS FITS AS COMFORTABLY AS POSSIBLE INTO THE HAND
BUT OF COURSE UH AL AL ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORE SORT OF
SLIGHTLY UNCONVENTIONAL OR ATTRACTIVE UH
SHA SHAPE FOR IT OVERALL
A CURVE MM-HMM
SOMETHING SORT OF SORT OF SL SLIGHTLY SORT OF BIOMORPHIC IN FORM
UH WHICH IT WOULD NEED TO BE TO SORT OF CONFORM TO THE SHAPE OF THE HAND MORE EFFICIENTLY ANYWAY
OKAY WELL I THINK WE'RE READY TO BEGIN
RIGHT MY NAME'S ADAM DUGUID WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF REAL REACTION UM WE HAVE IN THE GROUP
UM YEAH GO FOR IT MATE
N. E. Z.
EBENEZER
AND YOUR ROLE IS
YOU'RE THE MARKETING EXPERT OKAY
NEXT WE HAVE
T. R. I. K.
AND YOUR ROLE IN THIS IS
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
AND LASTLY WE HAVE
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE USER INTERFACE IS IT
DESIGNER
OKAY
RIGHT
THIS IS THE AGENDA FOR TODAY'S MEETING
AS YOU CAN SEE W OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND CLOSING
UM WE ALREADY GOT N THROUGH OPENING AND PARTIALLY THROUGH ACQUAINTANCE
SO THE REASON WE'RE HERE WE'RE GONNA DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AS YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW
THE VERY BROAD OVERVIEW IS ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
COURSE WE'LL HAVE TO GO INTO A BIT MORE UM DETAIL THAN THAT
BUT UH PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THE ORIGINAL IS GONNA BE A VERY KEY ASPECT TO THIS DESIGN
UM THERE'S A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS OUT THERE ANYWAY SO WE'RE GONNA NEED SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GONNA SET IT APART
THIS IS HOW TODAY SEEMS TO BE GOING TO WORK
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE THREE KAY PHASES AS YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY BEEN TOLD THE FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURAL AND THE DETAILED DESIGN
UM
FIRST ONE'S GONNA BE COVERING THE USER REQUIREMENT SPEC TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS WORKING DESIGN
SECOND SEEMS TO BE CONCEPTUAL COMPONENTS PROPERTIES MATERIALS AND THE LAST ONE IS A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF OUR DESIGN SO FAR
OF COURSE YOU'VE ALL GOT THE SIMILAR EMAILS I BELIEVE RIGHT
WHAT CAN I SAY
EBENEZER YOU WANNA HAVE A YOU WANNA DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL
BRILLIANTLY DONE
THANK YOU
TARIK WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SHOT AT A BIT OF ARTISTRY
OH UM YOU CAN CLIP THEM TO YOUR BELT
YOU SHOULD ALSO L UM HAVE YOUR THE LAPEL MIC ON AS WELL
YEP THE IT'S JUST ACROSS THERE THAT'S IT
YEP
YEAH
IT'LL FOLLOW YOU IF YOU
YOU CAN PROBABLY JUST STICK IT IN YOUR POCKET FOR NOW I WOULDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH
SHOULD HAVE GOOD RANGE
EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
DAVE IF YOU'D LIKE TO UH
HAVE A DASH
CHEERS
HARDLY WHAT I'D CALL THE BEST DRAWING IN THE WORLD BUT IT'LL DO FOR NOW
ALSO NOT QUITE AS FEARED AS YOUR AVERAGE TIGER BUT UH CATS ARE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ANIMALS THEY'RE VERY INDEPENDENT
THEY'RE SNOTTY AS HELL AT THE BEST OF TIMES AND UH WHAT CAN YOU SAY YOU GOT TO LOVE THOSE QUALITIES IN AN ANIMAL
RIGHT
I THINK WE'VE ALL MANAGED TO MASTER THE WHITEBOARD THERE BY LOOKS OF IT SO ON TO IT
PROJECT FINANCE
AS YOU CAN SEE TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS PER UNIT
THAT'S NOT A TERRIBLE LOT AS FAR AS I'M AWARE AND WE'RE HOPING TO SELL THEM FOR TWENTY FIVE
IF WE'RE AIMING FOR FIFTY MILLION EUROS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE SELLING AN AWFUL LOT OF THEM
YEP
WELL FIFTY MILLION AND IF YOU'RE MAKING TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS ON EACH ONE THEN AWFUL LOT NEED TO BE SOLD
OKAY
NOW WE BETTER ACTUALLY JUST GET ON WITH THE UH THE MEAT OF THE PROJECT
SO I'M GONNA GUESS THAT WE'VE ALL USED REMOTE CONTROLS
ANY IDEAS OF WHERE YOU THINK A NEW REMOTE CONTROL COULD GO INTO THIS MARKET
OKAY
OKAY YEAH THA THAT'S TRUE WITH THE PRICE RANGE WE'RE LOOKING AT GOING FOR A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD PROBABLY BE POSSIBLY OUT OF OUR YEAH
BUT YOU THINK UH AGAIN SOMETHING TO CONTROL MULTIPLE UNITS IN UH A SIMPLE FASHION
WOULD THE THE IDEA SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF ONE ON BUTTON WOULD TURN ON SAY THE VIDEO RECORDER
THE T. V. MAYBE THE SOUND SYSTEM AS WELL ALL IN ONE GO IS THAT KIND OF
OKAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A A GOOD STRONG IDEA
UM
ANY TAKES ON THIS
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH I'VE HEARD I'VE SEEN THE BAR CODE DESIGN BEFORE YEAH
OKAY WELL WE'RE BEGINNING TO RUN OUT OF TIME NOW SO WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF IDEAS WE CAN WE'LL HAVE TO WORK FAST
UM ALRIGHT AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE GOT THIRTY MINUTES UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING SO WE'LL HAVE TO TRY AND DECIDE ON SOME OF THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
UM HOW THE USER INTERFACE MIGHT WORK
THAT'LL BE A KEY ASPECT ESPECIALLY IF THE IDEA OF UM SOME KIND OF MACROS FACILITY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PROGRAM IT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSE BACK OR AT LEAST SOME KIND
UM
AND WE'RE GONNA MAYBE N TRY AND HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE USER WANTS YES
UM RIGHT
HAS ANYBODY GOT ANYTHING THEY'D LIKE TO ADD AT THIS STAGE ANYTHING THEY THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISSED SO FAR
I I DON'T SEE WHY NOT ALMOST EVERYBODY IS PROBABLY USED TO A CONSOLE BY NOW AND ALL OF THEM INCORPORATE SMALL KEYPADS ON THEM
IN FACT EVEN THE MOBILE PHONES THESE DAYS ARE BEGINNING TO USE THEM AS WELL SO IT'S PROBABLY AN INTERFACE THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE USED TO
UM
AND THAT COULD ALLOW N EASY NAVIGATION USED AS A JOYSTICK AS WELL
OKAY
SO SMALL STYLISH AND SOMETHING THAT'S JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT
OKAY
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO QUITE EASILY
I WOULD I WOULD HAVE HOPED SO ANYWAY
UM RIGHT
I'D SAY WE FINISH THIS ONE UP WE GET STARTED I'LL GET IN
I'LL WRITE UP WHAT WE'VE UM KIND OF QUICKLY DONE AND I'LL GET THAT OUT TO EVERYBODY
YEAH
OKAY
UM AS FAR AS I'M AWARE WE LEAVE THE MICROPHONES HERE UM UNLESS WE GET TOLD OTHERWISE AND JUST TAKE THE LAPTOPS WITH US
OH EBENEZER ADEMESOYE
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPELL THAT
S
UM N. E. Z.
E. R.
I'M THE MARKETING EXPERT
SURE
WHITEBOARD
'KAY
S OKAY
I WILL MAKE THIS QUICK SINCE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
UM
'KAY SO IT'S NOT THE BEST PICTURE IN THE WORLD
HERE WE HAVE AN ELEPHANT
FIRST POINT BEGINS WITH AN E. SAME LIKE EBENEZER
ALSO ELEPHANTS HAVE A VERY GOOD MEMORY MUCH LIKE MYSELF
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER BACK WHEN I USED TO LIVE BACK IN NIGERIA BUT I THINK I USED TO HAVE A PET ELEPHANT
SO ELEPHANTS ARE BIG STRONG AND GENTLE AND THEY HAVE GREAT MEMORIES AND THEY BEGIN WITH THE LETTER E. JUST LIKE EBENEZER
THANK YOU
OH
OH OH I THINK YOU GA
THE LITTLE
THE THE
OH THAT'S GOOD WE CAN CLIP THEM ON
OKAY
YEAH THERE WAS THIS MICROPHONE AS WELL THAT YOU
JUST UM SOMEWHERE
I THINK SO
YEAH
THERE YOU GO
OH THAT WAS PROFITING THAT WAS AN AMOUNT SO THAT'S THE AMOUNT MADE OKAY
YEAH
OH
'KAY
WELL UM I'VE NOTICED THAT UH GAMING C IS BECOMING QUITE POPULAR WITH TELEVISION UM WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WE USED TO E PLAY GAMES USING OUR CABLE
USING THE CABLE SUBSCRIBED THE CABLE PROVIDERS BUT OUR REMOTE CONTROLS WOULD GET WORN OUT REALLY EASILY
AND THE REMOTE CONTROL WAS NOT A GREAT KIND OF KEYBOAR UM KEYPAD FOR PLAYING GAMES
SO PERHAPS ONE THAT WAS MORE UM
SPECIALISED FOR GAME PLAYING OR INTERACTIVE TELEVISION
THEY THEY'VE RECENTLY BROUGHT OUT THIS NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR PEOPLE TO SET THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNELS OR UM TO RECORD THINGS
INSTEAD OF PEOPLE ENTERING IN WHAT TIME THINGS START
YOU SIMPLY STRI SLIDE A BAR TO SAY WHAT TIME IT BEGINS AND SLIDE ANOTHER BAR TO SAY WHAT TIME IT ENDS YOU KNOW THAT'S
YEAH IT'S IT'S TAKEN OUT THE
Y YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE UH REALLY CLEVER TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK FOR GAMING YOU KNOW YOU WANT YOU WANT SOME BIG BUTTONS FOR UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT SHOOT
UH YOU WANNA BE ABLE TO CHANGE ANGLES IN INTERACTIVE TELEVISION SO YOU NEED BUTTONS TO CHANGE THE TELEVISION ANGLE THE CAMERA ANGLES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEAH
WHAT THE USER WANTS UH
OKAY
OH
OKAY
MM-HMM
'KAY
SO
TARIK RAHMAN
T. A. R. I. K.
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
DO WE TAKE THEM OFF
OH RIGHT OKAY
AH HA
NOW WHERE DO I PUT THE
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE CLIPPED AS WELL
UH DESTROYING YOUR ELEPHANT HERE
UH HERE WE HAVE A TIGER
UH
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED TIGERS
THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE BIG THEY'RE BIGGEST CATS
UH I DID A PROJECT ON CATS IN THE WILD WHEN I WAS A KID AND UH IT WAS MY FAVOURITE CAT
JUST 'CAUSE IT WAS LOOKS THE BEST THE STRIPES ORANGE
MY DAD USED TO TALK ABOUT HE'S FROM BANGLADESH SO HE USED TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT THEM WHEN HE WAS WHEN I WAS A KID
AND UH THEY'RE JUST THE MOST FEARED OF OF UH ANIMALS IN THE WILD
SO UH THAT'S WHY I LIKE THEM
DIDN'T SAY AN ANYTHING ABOUT ME REALLY BUT
MM
'KAY
WELL WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GAMING AND STUFF DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF
STICK ON IT RATHER THAN BUTTONS
LIKE UH CONTROL PADS YOU KNOW OF GAMES BUT OR IS THAT A BIT RIDICULOUS
YEAH
MM
OKAY
YEAH IT'S IN THE IT'S IN THE FOLDER YEAH
MM
OKAY THIS IS A BRIEF RUN THROUGH OF THE UM OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE
AS UM IS UH THE THE THE PRESENTATION IS UH ALREADY SLIGHTLY OBSOLETE BECAUSE I HAD IN MIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD UH BE I BE AIMED AT CONTROLLING MULTIPLE DEVICES BUT UH THERE'S STILL STUFF OF RELEVANCE
SO
PRESS ON
I'VE LOOKED AT LOOKED AT A NUM UH COUPLE OF OTHER UH REMOTE CONTROL MODELS JUST FOR AN IDEA OF BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES
UM
AND WASN'T REALLY SATISFIED BY WHAT I SAW I HAVE TO SAY SO THIS IS MORE SORT OF SPRINGBOARD FOR UH HOW THESE COULD BE IMPROVED ON
UM UM BASICALLY THE JOB OF THE DEVICE IS TO SEND COMMANDS TO AN APPLIANCE IN THIS CASE THE TELEVISION SET
UM TO SAVE YOU GETTING OFF YOUR BACKSIDE
UM AND THERE'S TWO MAIN TRENDS IN TH IN THE SORT OF DESIGN PRACTICE
ON THE ONE HAND AND THIS UH THIS PARTICULARLY RELATES TO ITS SORT OF EARLIEST MODELS WHERE WITH YOU KNOW I SO SO MANY BUTTONS ON IT SO ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE TELEVISION SET
UM GIVING YOU EVERY POSSIBLE FUNCTION THAT THE THAT THE DEVICE HAS THE REMOTE CONTROL CONTROLS
AND MOST OF THESE FUNCTIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE USED IT CREATES A RATHER USER UNFRIENDLY INTERFACE
AND ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A USER FOCUSED APPROACH THAT PARES THINGS DOWN TO JUST WHAT WHAT IS MOST LIKELY TO GET USED
UM
WITH UH A AND A AND OF COURSE THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SORT OF LOSS OF FUNCTION HERE OBVIOUSLY BUT MOSTLY THAT'S RELATIVELY PERIPHERAL FUNCTIONS
AND SO YOU GO FOR SOMETHING THAT'S FAIRLY INTUITIVE TO USE
AND UM WELL F THE FOR THE MOST PART FOR T. V. REMOTE IT'S UH THA THAT WOULD BE CHANNEL CONTROL AND VOLUME
UM AND IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU ARE WANTING TO INCORPORATE UH CONTROL OF A D. V. D. V. D. OR UH
V. C. R. PRESUMABLY INTO THAT THEN THERE'S A PLAY PAUSE STOP REWIND FAST FORWARD RECORD SO FORTH
UM
MY OWN VIEW IS THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE GOING FOR A USER FOCUSED DESIGN
UM BUT UH THE PRO I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF THE SORT OF USER FOCUSED DESIGNS THAT ARE ABOUT IS THAT THEY SORT OF MAKE ASSUMPTIONS IN ADVANCE ABOUT WHAT UH WHAT A GIVEN USER'S GOING TO UH WANT MO WANT TO DO FROM WANT IT TO DO MOST
SO SOMETHING THAT'S UH
SOMETHING THAT IS MORE PROGRAMMABLE
THAT UH PERH PERHAPS HAS THE FULL RANGE OF FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE TO IT BUT YOU CAN THEN SPECIFY YOURSELF WHAT YOU'RE MOST LIKELY TO WANT
UM SO THAT THOSE ARE THEN IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH FAIRLY MINIMAL NUMBER OF CONTROLS
UM I LIKED EBENEZER'S IDEA OF INCLUDING A JOYSTICK IN THAT AND UH POSSIBLY A SORT OF FAIRLY MINIMAL NUMBER OF SORT OF FUNCTION BUTTONS
AND HAVE A DISP YOU THEN HAVE SOME SORT OF BASIC DISPLAY ON IT SO THAT IF YOU'RE UM SORT OF CHA CHANGING FROM DIFFERENT MODES FOR THE DEVICE IT'LL TELL YOU JUST EXACTLY WHAT UH YOU KNOW EACH DIRECTION OF THE UH
OF THE UM JOYSTICK'S GOING TO DO OR WHA OR WHAT EACH FUNCTION BUTTON'S GOING TO DO
UM THIS IS ACTUALLY A AGAIN SLIGHTLY TAKING INSPIRATION OFF OF UH GAMES CONTROLLERS
YOU KNOW THE PLAYSTATION CONTROL WHERE YOU HAVE FOUR BASIC FUNCTION BUTTONS THAT ARE JUST MARKED WITH UM DISTINCTIVE UH GEOMETRICAL SHAPES BUT THE AND THEN DEPENDENT ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH IT WHAT GAME AND SO ON UM THOSE UH THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE THEN SORT OF FURTHER SPECIFIED
AND SO IT'S TAKING TAKING THE LEAD FROM THAT
UM
THAT'S IT
MM
MM
MM
I I WAS THINKING THAT THE REMOTE THE UM SORT OF DEFAULT FUNCTIONS FOR THE JOYSTICK WOULD BE UP AND DOWN FOR UH VOLUME LEFT AND RIGHT FOR CHANNELS
UM I THINK PROBABLY FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF HOURS OF USING IT UM BUT YOU KNOW MUSCLE MEMORY'S A WONDERFUL THING UM
AND I THINK AND I THINK THAT SIZE OF UH DISPLAY WAS ABOUT WHAT I HAD IN MIND
UM THOUGH
I MEAN I W I WOULD SAY THAT UH WE COULD PROBABLY PROBABLY BE REQUIRED TO UM MO MOST OF THE MOBILE PHONE DISPLAYS YOU SEE THESE DAYS ARE COLOUR BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO STICK TO BLACK AND WHITE
SI SI SIMPLY TO KEEP M KEEP THE UNIT COST DOWN
UM I MEAN COLOUR COULD BE A SORT OF SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT BUT UH YOU KNOW COST A BIT OF EXTRA MONEY F W W W W W ONCE EVERYONE'S GOT THE FIRST
YOU KNOW OH COLOUR'S OUT WE'LL HAVE TO REPLACE IT WON'T WE
IT DOES NOTHING EXTRA
MM
MM
MM
I TH THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE UH THE UH JOYSTICK IS THAT UH YOU YOU YOU THEN BASICALLY YOU CAN THEN BASICALLY PUT IT I MEAN FOR FOR T. T. FOR T. V. REMOTE ALONE
YOU COULD PUT
UM I MEAN THERE ARE LIKE I SAY THE THE THE MAIN THINGS PEOPLE DO WITH A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL IS THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL
YOU CAN PACK ALL THAT ONTO WAS ONTO A SINGLE CONTROL
UM
BUT UH BUT THE BUT THEN O UH OBVIOUSLY IF UH
YOU KNOW IF YOU I IF YOU WANTED TO ACCESS FURTHER FUNCTIONS I YOU YOU THEN GET TO SORT OF MENU NAVIGATION
I MEAN WITH THINGS LIKE CH WITH THINGS LIKE TUNING AND CHANNELS UM YOU KNOW ADJUSTING BRIGHTN UH BRIGHTNESS AND FIDDLY THINGS THAT NO ONE REALLY BOTHERS WITH
MOST T. V. S THESE DAYS ACTUALLY HAVE MENUS ANYWAY SO THIS WOULD BE A FAIRLY RATIONAL WAY OF INTEGRA
INTEGRATING THE UH THE REMOTE WITH THE DEVICE IT'S CONTROLLING
UM
CONCERN ABOUT OUR MARKET
UM IF WE ARE I MEAN MOST OF THE UH
OF THE REPLACEMENT REMOTE MARKET IS SORT OF REMOTE CONTROL RATIONALISATION
UM YOU'VE GOT TWENTY DIFFERENT DEVICES IN YOUR LIVING ROOM YOU WANT ONE WO Y YOU WANT ONE THAT'LL DO THE JOB OF ALL OF THEM
UM IF ALL YOU'RE REPLACING IS ONE OF THE YOU KNOW HOWEVER MANY REMOTES YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIVING ROOM
UM YOU KNOW YOU STILL NEED SEPARATE REMOTES FOR EVERYTHING ELSE
I JUST THINK THAT UH POSSIBLY MM
MM
MM
DOES THAT UM WOULD THAT INCLUDE UM ACCESS TO SAY INTERACTIVE FUNCTIONS ON DIGITAL OR CABLE
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM
JUST A THOUGHT
UM MAYBE THEN OUR MARKET SHOULD BE T. V. MANUFACTURERS RATHER THAN THE PUBLIC
TRY AND SELL IT T SELL IT TO THEM TO SUPPLY WITH
UM
MM YEAH I'VE SEEN THEM
MM
YEAH I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM
MM YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT'S
YEAH
FOR VOLUME
ACTUALLY HOW
ACTUALLY I WOULD SAY MAYBE TWO TWO FUNCTION BUTTONS THE Y WE'RE NOW USING THE MENUS BUTTON AND UM AND AN OG AND AN OKAY BUTTON
I MEAN CERTAINLY SOMETHING I'VE FOUND WITH THE JOYSTICK ON MO THE JOYSTICKS ON MOBILE PHONES IS THAT A LOT OF THE TIME TH THE DEVICE MISTAKES YOU TRYING TO MOVE IT IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER FOR PUSHING DOWN FOR OKAY
OR VICE VERSA
AND THAT'S REALLY IRRITATING
THE O THE O THE OTHER DIS DESIGN CONSTRAINT I THINK WE SHOULD BEAR IN MIND IS THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW VERY MUCH USED TO USING A REMOTE CONTROL ONE HANDEDLY
UM SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT E EVEN WITH THE JOYSTICK
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CAN JUST SIT COMFORTABLY IN THE PALM OF THE HAND AND HAVE THE JOYSTICK JUST CONTROLLED BY THE THUMB
OH
SO SO A SMALL SPEAKER YOU MEAN
MM-HMM
BLUE ONES PARTICULARLY
PLUS THAT'S A NICE WEE DESIGN TOUCH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
ACTUALLY ONE ONE WEE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
UM IF WE DO END UP TRYING TO MARKET THIS TO TELEVISION MANUFACTURERS THEN THE UM THEN THE TRANSMITTER COULD ACTUALLY BE BUILT INTO THE TELEVISION
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN IF IT W IF WE GET A MAJOR TELEVISION MANUFACTURER TO SAY Y OH YEAH WE'LL HAVE THAT
SAVE US THE BOTHER THEN THAT'S YOU KNOW VAST AMOUNTS OF SALES
QUITE QUICKLY
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
I THOUGHT THE UH THE D THE DOUBLE ARC COULD PERHAPS UH BE THE UH THE ENTER BUTTON
NO ON THE DESKTOP YOU'LL FIND YOU SHOULD FIND THAT THERE'S A PROJECT DOCUMENTS LINK
A WELL ACTUALLY JUST THERE
YEAH
THAT'S IT
IF YOU DUMP IT IN THERE
YOUR USERNAME
OKAY
EXCELLENT
RIGHT
HOPEFULLY THAT'S US READY TO UH TO GO
SO
FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING
WE'LL HAVE TO FLESH OUT SOME OF THE UH STUFF
UM
WE'LL START WITH THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING
NOT A LOT THANKFULLY TO SAY
WE INTRODUCED OURSELVES DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF A MACRO FACILITY INTERAC INTERACTING THE T. V. A BIT MORE UM MENTIONING OF BAR CODE
JOYSTICK FOR USER MANIPULATION UM AND ERGONOMICS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AS WELL
UM IT'S COME TO MY ATTENTION THE FOLLOWING
TELETEXT HAS BECOME OUTDATED DUE TO THE POPULAT POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET
REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR THE T. V.
UM
DUE FOR UH TIME TO MARKET AND POSSIBLY ALSO COST ISSUES
UM ALSO KEY IS THE CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD STAY RECOGNISABLE UM F UH YOUR COLOUR AND SLOGAN OF COURSE IS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THERE
UM
NOW
JUST TO SAY QUICKLY UH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ONLY BEING USED FOR A TELEVISION THE MACRO FACILITY MAY NOW NOT BE REQUIRED
UM OR AT L ITS FUNCTIONALITY WOULD HAVE BEEN OF LIMITED USE
SO TO THE POINT IN MY OPINION ANYWAY THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE WORTH PURSUING
UM IF ANYBODY DISAGREES WE CAN UH DEFINITELY SAY SO
UM AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL JUST CRACK ON AND WE'LL GET EVERYTHING GOING
UM I'D LIKE TO IF POSSIBLE HEAR FROM OUR MARKETING EXPERT FIRST TO HELP US GAIN AN IDEA OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO
SO UM I'LL JUST LOAD UP YOUR PRESENTATION FROM HERE IF YOU WANT
YEP
SORRY
UH
IS YOURS THE
OH SORRY
OKAY RIGHT
UH IF YOU THAT'S ALL RIGHT
IF YOU DO YOU WANT ME TO JUST CYCLE THROUGH IT FOR YOU OR
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEP
OKAY YEP
MM-HMM
IF YOU COULD UH
SOR IF YOU COULD SPEED IT UP A BIT YEAH
IF YOU COULD UH SPEED IT UP A BIT PLEASE YEAH
SORRY
COOL
OKAY
EXCELLENT
RIGHT
UM
HEAR FROM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER NOW I THINK MIGHT BE AN IDEA
UM YOU'VE GOT YOUR PRESENTATION NOW IS IT ON THE IS IT
OKAY
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
NO
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT
UM IF WE COULD HEAR FROM OUR INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER OR DESIGNER
IF YOU LOOK ON THE DESKTOP YOU'LL FIND THAT THERE'S A LINK TO THE PROJECT FOLDER OR PROJECT DOCUMENTS
IF YOU SAVE IT IN THERE WE CAN OPEN IT UP FROM HERE
ARE YOU FINDING IT OKAY OR
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OH
YEAH
AH DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT AT ALL MATE
OKAY
WELL
OH SORRY I'M I'M INTERRUPTING YOU
ARE YOU IS IT YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT
UM RIGHT WE CAN PROBABLY SKIP THAT FOR NOW
SO WE'VE HAD SOME STUFF PUT FORWARD UM
ALONG WITH THE NEW USER REQUIREMENTS
UM WE'VE HAD A LOT OF KIND OF INPUT I'D SAY SO FAR
UM
I HEAR WHAT THE MARKETING EXPERT'S SAYING ABOUT UM VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROL
HOWEVER I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF WORRIES ABOUT THAT
THE POWER REQUIRED UM AND THE ABILITY TO THE COST IT SEEMS LIKE FOR UH AN EMBEDDED SYSTEM THIS COULD CAUSE US ISSUES
UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THAT THERE'S FAIRLY ROBUST SERVICES ON UH COMPUTERS VIA UH VIA VOICE I. B. M. DO UM DRAG AND DICTATE
BUT THESE REQUIRE A LOT OF MEMORY AND USUALLY UM STATE QUITE ADVANCED PROCESSOR REQUIREMENTS
UM VOICE ACTIVATION COULD BE AN INTERESTING IDEA BUT I THINK THAT OUR IND INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WOULD PROBABLY UPON SOME RESEARCH SAY THAT IT'S MAYBE NOT FEASIBLE
UM THAT'S JUST MY VIEW RIGHT NOW
HOWEVER THE IDEA OF A JOYSTICK AND THEN MAYBE AN L. C. D. WHICH HAS BEEN KIND OF PUT FORWARD SO FAR IT'S ALMOST LIKE HAVING A SMALL
T. NOT T. V. TO SAY BUT IF YOU CAN CONTROL ALMOST ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY FROM THE DISPLAY
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH POWER AN L. C. D. WOULD TAKE BUT IT MIGHT BE QUITE LOW
WELL LITERALLY UM IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DISPLAY MAYBE SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN UM THOSE ON A A MOBILE PHONE
SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN READ AN AN UM FAIR AMOUNT OF INFORMATION
TRAVERSE MAYBE QUITE A FEW MENUS IF WE MAYBE USED MOBILE PHONES AS A GOOD EXAMPLE THEY USUALLY INCORPORATE THEY HAVE THE KEYPAD
AND THEN EVR ALL THE OTHER FUNCTIONALITY IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED INSIDE BY TRAVERSING AROUND
THAT COULD BE ONE POSSIBILITY
UM AND THEN WE COULD HAVE LIKE SAY THE COMMON BUTTONS AS YOU SAY VOLUME CONTROL CHANGING CHANNELS
WE
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU
MM-HMM
THAT WOULD BE MY FEELING AS WELL I THINK WE COULD POSSIBLY CREATE QUITE A USEFUL USER INTERFACE
UM NOW I MEAN I DON'T SORRY GO FOR IT
I THINK IT COULD PROBABLY BE AIMED AT MOST PEOPLE WHO'VE USED A MOBILE
AND THAT MIGHT BE JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING TRY TO TARGET MOST PEOPLE
UM IF WE ARE IF WE WERE TO FOLLOW THAT AVENUE
WE MIGHT BE S YOU KNOW UM WE'RE KIND OF ALMOST RELYING ON THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH A MOBILE PHONE I SUPPOSE
BUT THAT DOES COVER A VERY LARGE SECTION OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE
UM I MEAN I IMAGINE AS WELL THAT THE ACTUAL L. C. D. AND MAYBE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE JOYSTICK AS WELL WOULD BE FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY
WHICH MAYBE DOESN'T GET USED AS OFTEN
MAYBE IT MAKES IT EASY FOR THEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO UM CHANGE THE CHANNELS AS IN THE FREQUENCIES AND SUCH FOR REPROGRAMMING IT
UM AND YOU CAN STILL HAVE THE MAIN BUTTONS THAT ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO TURN THE MACHINE ON AND OFF D UP AND DOWN IT DEPENDS
I MEAN MAYBE WE HAVE THE FOL UM THE JOYSTICK AS A SEPARATE ONE FOR THE OTHER FUNCTIONS THEN
THAT THERE'S JUST A A SMALL NUMBER OF AS YOU WERE SAYING UH BUTTONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEFINED
SO LIKE WE GO FOR THE NICE STANDARD UM UP AND DOWN FOR AND VOLUME CONTROL
SO THAT LITERALLY ANYBODY CAN COME ALONG PICK UP THE REMOTE AND STILL KNOW WHAT DO DO
AND THEY CAN COMPLETELY IGNORE MOST OF THE FUNCTIONALITY WHICH WOULD BE FOR SAY THE O ACTUAL OWNER OF THE THE T. V. AND WHO WOULD NORMALLY USE THE UNIT
I DUNNO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE TO STICK TO I'M AFRAID THIS ISN'T ONE THAT I'VE JUST ARBITRARILY DECIDED ON
SO UM THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE SOLID ONES THAT HAS TO BE OBEYED FOR NOW
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU BUT THIS IS OUR DESIGN SPEC FOR NOW
'FRAID TO SAY
UM
I WOULD SAY SO YES BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE REMOTE BOXES AND THAT IS A SEPARATE UNIT
UM I THINK THAT IT I WOULD SAY THAT THE DESIGN SPEC WE'VE BEEN WITH IS FOR THE TELEVISION ONLY FOR NOW
AND UNTIL WE HEAR OTHERWISE WE SHOULD GO WITH JUST THAT
OKAY
MAYBE WE'LL HEAR DIFFERENTLY BUT FOR NOW
IT WOULD BE EASE OF MANIPULATION OF CERTAIN FUNCTIONS YES
UM
THERE IS THAT POSSIBILITY YES
B HOWEVER I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE'LL BE GOING WITH THAT BUT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THE AVENUE OF THE MARKETING EXPERT
THAT MIGHT BE SALES WHO ARE NOT IN THIS MEETING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WAS UH THE ABILITY TO LOSE A REMOTE WHICH AS YOU SAID YOU'VE DONE IN FACT WE'VE PROBABLY ALL DONE
UM I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A GIMMICK OR NOT
BUT HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER SEEN THOSE ODD LITTLE KEY RINGS WHERE IF YOU WHISTLE IT WILL BEEP AND YOU TELL YOU WHERE IT IS
UM
WELL THE OTHER OPTION OF COURSE IS THAT UM THE WELL I WAS GOING TO SAY CLAPPING UM
UM DIGITAL TELEPHONES UH FOR EXAMPLE ONE UNIT HAS OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT BASE UNIT
SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE'S A BUTTON BUT MAYBE IT'S A BUTTON THAT YOU ATTACH TO THE T. V.
SOMETHING WHICH YOU WHEN YOU PRESS THAT IT WOULD BEEP TO GIVE ITS LOCATION AWAY ON THE REMOTE UNIT
AND THAT COULD BE SOMETHING COULD UM SEPARATE US A BIT
AND THAT WAY BECAUSE WE'RE ATTACHING WHAT WOULD BE A SMALL BUTTON TO THE T. V. AGAIN SAY WHAT
IT WOULD BE A SMALL TRANSMITTER UM WATCH BATTERY TYPE SCENARIO I WOULD SAY
OR SOMETHING THAT IF IT WAS PROBLEMS ENOUGH YOU COULD ACTUALLY EVEN JUST UM I DON'T POWER THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK INTO
YEP
YEAH IT'S UH PUTTING A LOT ON YOUR SHOULDERS THERE SO I MEAN THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT SEPARATES US A BIT FROM THE MARKET AS WELL
SO
TO GO ON FROM HERE
UM WE HAVE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THE REMOTE
BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS MEETING IT WOULD BE BEST TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING THIS IS THE DESIGN WE'RE GONNA TRY AND GET
THIS IS HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE OURSELVES LOOK UNIQUE
DO WE GO FOR MAYBE A REMOTE CONTRO UH SORRY WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A REMOTE CONTROL OBVIOUSLY
DO WE GO FOR A SMALL JOYSTICK THAT WOULD OPERATE SAY CHANGING CHANNELS
UP AND DOWN AND THEN WHAT ANOTHER BUTTON THAT WOULD SAY THAT IT'S NOW BEING USED TO MANOEUVRE ROUND THE L. C. D.
WE COULD USE SAY THE LEFT AND RIGHT FOR CHANGING CHANNELS AND THE UP AND DOWN FOR VOLUME AND
OKAY
MM-HMM
VOL
VOLUME SELECTION OKAY YEP THE TELETEXT WE'RE GAMBLING WITH AND WE'RE GONNA SAY IT'S DEAD THE WAY OF THE DODO
SO WE WELL SORRY WE COULD MAYBE EVEN GO AS FAR AS SAYING POWER BUTTON SMALL JOYSTICK L. C. D.
AND THEN WHAT MAYBE IS IT ONE MORE BUTTON TO SAY THAT YOU'RE USING THE MENU SYSTEM
AND WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PUSHING DOWN ON THE JOYSTICK TO SAY OKAY
SO WE'RE HAVING VERY VERY FEW BUTTONS INVOLVED BUT NAVIGATION AROUND A MENU FOR MOST THINGS
OKAY
OKAY
UM
OKAY
SO UM WE'RE ACTUALLY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A ROUGH IDEA
DO WE INCORPORATE THE IDEA OF TRYING TO F LOCATE THE REMOTE CONTROL AGAIN VIA A BEEPING NOISE
DO YOU MIND LOOKING
THE ABILITY TO LOCATE IT AGAIN
SO THAT WOULD REQUIRE A UM TRANSMITTER MAYBE ATTACHED TO THE T. V. JUST SO THAT IT SAYS FIND ME
AND WHAT A BASICALLY A SMALL MICROPHONE UM ON THE ACTUAL UNIT CAN MAYBE HIDE IT IN THE BASE
SORRY
SOME SPEAKER SORRY YEAH
UM
E US WE MIGHT BE BETTER WITH THE SOUND POSSIBLY WE COULD MAYBE INCORPORATE
TH E THE TRUE FACT CONSIDERING THE COST OF AN L. E. D. WE COULD JUST INCORPORATE IT ANYWAY
THE L. E. D. S CAN BE SURPRISINGLY BRIGHT NOW
UM
SO BY THE SOUNDS OF IT WITH WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING SO FAR
YOUR DESIGN UM THE USER INTERFACE IS STILL QUITE OPEN YOU COULD GO FOR QUITE AN INTERESTING DESIGN
BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY GOING TO HAVE A VERY FEW KEY AND YOU'VE GOT
YOU KNOW A SMALL L. C. D. JOYSTICK
E I THINK IT LEAVES YOU OPEN TO A A POTENTIAL WIDE RANGE OF SHAPES SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE IT STAND OUT SLIGHTLY
UM IF YOU COULD LOOK INTO WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED SO FAR THE FEASIBILITY OF UM SMALL TRANSMITTER
UM AND SUCH MAYBE IF AN L. C. D. SCREEN REQUIRES TOO MUCH POWER OR SUCH
EBENEZER UM MARKETING EXPERT
IF YEAH IF YOU COULD MAYBE AS WELL SEE WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF THIS MINIMALIST APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN
WHERE OF A JOYSTICK TO CONTROL THE VERY BASIC FUNCTIONS AND THEN THE IDEA OF MANIPULATING IT LIKE YOU WOULD A MOBILE
I DON'T KNOW HOW EASY THAT WILL BE WITHIN THE TIME FRAME BUT COULD BE SOMETHING WE COULD MAYBE LOOK INTO
OKAY
UM ANY LAST COMMENTS THAT ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO PUT FORWARD
ANYTHING THAT THEY THINK HAS BEEN MISSED OUT
BIT OF A WIDE OPEN QUESTION THERE OF COURSE
FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME IF YOU THINK THAT UH WE'VE SCREWED SOMETHING UP AND WANNA GET IT RECTIFIED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
RIGHT
SPEAKER AND L. E. D. FOR LOCATING UM
TRANSMITTER
GETTING THE EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE YEP THAT'S QUITE TRUE
UM AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CAN EASILY BE ADOPTED AT THE LAST MINUTE AS WELL I'D SAY
THE ELECTRONICS COULD BE S EITHER PLACED EXTERNALLY OR INTERNALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL SO THAT'S GOOD
USES MAYBE GIVES US A NEW POTENTIAL MARKET
'KAY
OH ONE THING THAT WE'VE ALMOST NOT TALKED ABOUT AT ALL MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT UM USER INTERFACE
WE ALSO NEED TO MAYBE GET THE SLOGAN IN HERE UM IT'S I'M POINTING AT MY LAPTOP WHAT IN GOD
REAL REACTION AND SUCH
SO UM
OH SORRY
MY APOLOGIES
NO IT COULD WELL BE I'VE PROBABLY MISSED THAT
UM I THINK THAT'S L ALMOST THE LAST MINUTE THING WE CAN JUST INCORPORATE INTO THE ACTUAL PLASTIC ON TOP
SO I'M NOT TOO CONCERNED A THAT WE HAVEN'T GONE INTO DEPTH ABOUT THAT
BUT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU COULD CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SHAPES
IN FACT WE MIGHT LIKE TO PUT A SLOGAN ON AND UM POSSIBLY THE TWO R. S TO SIGNIFY THE COMPANY
RATHER THAN REAL REACTION
SOUNDS GOOD
AND I'D SAY THAT THAT'S US FOR NOW
OKAY
JUST PUT IT ON THE DESKT DESKTOP
PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH
WHAT'S YOUR USERNAME
WHAT'S YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD
MM-HMM
SORRY
OKAY
THERE WE GO
'KAY
SURE
UM SH WOULD YOU LIKE TO I'LL JUST DO IT FROM HERE
UM TRY SECOND ONE MAYBE
TRY IT YEAH MAYBE
YEAH
OKAY
OH I THOUGHT I PUT IN MY LAST NAME I GUESS NOT BUT
OKAY
OH YEAH THAT'D BE FINE THAT'D BE GREAT
OKAY
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT BY ME EBENEZER
OKAY SO UM WE DID SOME RESEARCH WE ASKED ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE THEIR OPINIONS ON REMOTE CONTROLS
WE ASKED SOME UH OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS JUST WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
GOT A LOT OF RE RESPONSES AND WE ASKED SOME VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD FEEDBACK
PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THIS IS ONLY A HUNDRED PEOPLE SO EVEN WHEN THE GROUPS ARE DIVIDED INTO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE THERE'S ONLY MAYBE TEN PEOPLE FIFTEEN PEOPLE IN EACH GROUP
OKAY
SO WE GOT SOME THE BAD STUFF WE GOT REMOTES ARE OFTEN LOST
I OFTEN LOSE MY REMOTE CONTROL THE BACK OF THE COUCH SOME PLACE
AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT LOST PERMANENTLY IT TAKES ME A FEW MINUTES TO FIND IT
MOST BUTTONS ARE NOT USED ANY MORE LIKE YOU SAID TELETEXT IS OUTDATED NOW
I REMEMBER TRYING TO LOAD A D. V. D. PLAYER RECENTLY
AND THERE WERE SO MANY BUTTONS IT TOOK ME I DON'T KNOW MAYBE TEN MINUTES TO TO GO THROUGH EACH BUTTON
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE SHIFT BUTTON TO ACCESS THE YELLOW BUTTONS YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST A LOT OF STUFF THAT NO ONE REALLY USES
AND IF THEY DO NOT VERY OFTEN
TAKES TOO LONG TO MASTER THE REMOTE CONTROL
I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE BIG THEY HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS
YOU HAVE TO HOLD DOWN MORE THAN ONE KEY AT ONE TIME TO DO SOMETHING THEY'RE JUST NOT GREAT TO USE
WE JUST GOT A LOT OF BAD COMPLAINTS ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE REMOTE CONTROLS
SOME OF THE GOOD STUFF WE GOT
BETWEEN THE AGE OF UH FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY EXTRA FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
NOW DON'T GET EXCITED YET I'VE GOT MORE TO SAY ON THAT
MOST PEOPLE'D BE WILLING TO PAY FOR THAT UM MOST PEOPLE WANT REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE PRETTY
THEY WANT IT TO BE FANCY TH THEY THEY WANT IT TO BE DIFFERENT
EVERYBODY HAS A WHITE REMOTE CONTROL WITH BLACK BUTTONS AND A RED BUTTON AND A GREEN BUTTON NOT EVERYBODY WANTS THAT
FINALLY MY OPINION
THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING IS COOL
AND UH VOICE RECOGNITION THE SOFTWARE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE EXIST ALREADY
IT'S A BIT SKETCHY AT SOME TIMES UH YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET GOOD ALWAYS ACCURATE RESULTS
BUT FOR A VERY FIXED NUMBER OF WORDS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
HOW MANY DIFFERENT WORDS CAN YOU HAVE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT
CHANNEL FIVE CHANNEL SEVEN YOU KNOW HOW MANY YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT MANY WORDS
FOR A FIXED VOCABULARY IT WORKS QUITE WELL
I'M PRETTY SURE PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT
BUT AFTER A WHILE PEOPLE MAY WANNA RETURN IT
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO TO SAY SOM I MEAN MOST PEOPLE USE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR SWITCHING TO CHANNELS
AND THEY SAY THEY DO THAT ABOUT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE TIME
USING THE REMOTE CONTROL NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE TIME FOR CHANGING CHANNELS AND THAT'S FOR FLICKERING THROUGH CHANNELS
SO IF YOU HAVE TO SAY UP UP UP UP
IF YOU HAVE TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME THEN PEOPLE MIGHT GET A BIT FED UP WITH THAT AND THEY MAY RETURN IT
HOWEVER OH BECAUSE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE EXISTS ALREADY
THERE'S NO NEED TO SPEND MONEY ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUT THIS DOES MEAN THE NEED FOR MICROPHONES IN THE
IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS AN UNUSUAL FEATURE IN MY OPINION
BUT IF WE DO HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT YOU CAN UH GET RID OF
SEE YOU COULD THERE'RE TWO OPTIONS
EITHER YOU HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION BY ITSELF WHICH I THINK IS A BIT IMPRACTICAL FOR LIKE NIGHT TIME IF YOU WANNA BE WATCHING TELEVISION AND YOU WANNA BE QUIET
OR I DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE A VISITOR COMING ROUND AND THE REMOTE'S ONLY TRAINED FOR YOU IT'S A BIT IMPRACTICAL TO HAVE JUST VOICE RECOGNITION BY ITSELF
SO YOU CAN HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION AND A REGULAR REMOTE
BUT IMAGINE YOU GOT RID OF THE REGULAR REMOTE PART THEN YOU CAN DESIGN THE REMOTE TO LOOK ANY WAY YOU WANT IT TO LOOK
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON PHYSICAL SIZE
OR SHAPE IT IT COULD BE AS FANCY AS YOU WANT IT TO BE
YOU KNOW IT COULD BE LIKE A LOLLIPOP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETHING WEIRD LIKE THAT
AS LONG AS THE VOICE RECOGNITION STUFF WORKS THAT'S THAT'S FINE
SO WE HAVE THE THREE BIRDS WE HAVE THE DESIGN THAT WE HAVE THE THE FANCY BIT
RIGHT THE VOICE RECOGNITION'S FANCY IT'S COOL IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S RADICAL SO
AND THEN WE HAVE AN EXTRA BIT I DON'T REMEMBER SO I'M PRETTY SURE PEOPLE WILL BUY THE REMOTE
BUT IS IT PRACTICAL TO HAVE A VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IN A REMOTE CONTROL I THINK IS A BIG QUESTION
UM WILL PEOPLE
WILL PEOPLE BE WILLING TO WAIT FOR THE THE PERIOD THAT IT'LL TAKE TO TRAIN THE REMOTE
'CAUSE I THINK IT WILL THE REMOTE WILL UH GET BETTER OVER TIME WITH THE SAME USER USER
BUT FOR THE FIRST WEEK OR FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS ARE YOU WILLING TO WAIT ARE YOU WILLING TO HAVE A BAD REMOTE CONTROL
AND UH WHAT IF YOU HAVE VISITORS COME ROUND THEY STAY THE NIGHT THEY WANNA USE THE T. V.
THEY CAN'T USE THE REMOTE BECAUSE THEY SPEAK DIFFERENTLY TO YOU
UM HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR REGIONAL ACCENTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
UH WILL PEOPLE RETURN THE REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL IF THEY HAVE THE MONEY YOU KNOW SO
DO OUR AUDIENCE HAVE THE MONEY BUT WOULD THEY RETURN IT AFTER A WHILE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS FAST AS PRESSING A BUTTON IT'S NOT A PRACTICAL
SO
THESE ARE THINGS I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER
I THINK IT'S COOL
I'M SORRY
SURE
I'M ABOUT TO END YEAH
I THINK IT'S COOL
BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME CONSIDERATIONS
SO YEAH
THERE WAS UH A WEBSITE UH
RIGHT HERE
G I STARTED MAKING STUFF UP THEN I GOT AN EMAIL SAYING
MM
WELL LIKE IF YOU GO TO ONE UH WHICHEVER ONE YOU WERE WORKING YEAH AND YOU JUST CLICK FILE SAVE AS
MM-HMM
'KAY
MM
I UH
MM-HMM
MM
SURE BUT THE IDEA OF A REMOTE WITH A MENU OR AND A JOYSTICK I THINK LIKE I H IF I WAS IN THE HABIT OF BUYING REMOTE CONTROLS THEN I WOULD WANT ONE
BUT I THINK WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC AUDIENCE YOU KNOW
LIKE WHAT IS OUR TARGET AUDIENCE WHAT NICHE ARE NICHE ARE WE TRYING TO MARKET AND CORNER
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE FOR WHOM IS THIS INTENDED
EVERYBODY
MOST PEOPLE YEAH
MM-HMM
SURE
I THINK THAT'S FAIR YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
HMM
OKAY SPECIFICALLY TELEVISION
SO THE JOYSTICK IS JUST FOR DIFFERENTNESS
OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
IT'S JUST THE WAY I FIGURE IT TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS PER UNIT WE HAVE TO SELL AT LEAST LIKE THREE MILLION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
NOT TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE THE MONEY WE WASTE ON REMOTES THAT NO ONE BUYS YOU KNOW
LIKE IF WE MADE A PERF IF WE MADE A KS FOR EVERY REMOTE WE MADE SOMEONE BOUGHT IT THEN WE HAVE TO SELL A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS
WE JUST
IS THIS GONNA BE ENOUGH TO TO SELL
YEAH
I HAD ONE OF THOSE AND MY BROTHER AND MY DAD COULD HAVE BEAT ME UP BECAUSE IT IT WENT OFF ALL THE TIME ACCIDENTALLY
THE CLAPPING ONE
TO A TELEVISION
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
I THINK SO YEAH
BUT WE HAVE A FREQUENCY OF HOW WHAT PEOPLE USE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR MOST
UM POWER IS USED LIKE ONCE PER HOUR CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT PER HOUR
THAT'S BY FAR THE BIGGEST ONE AND THEN TELETEXT IS STILL HERE THAT'S LIKE FOURTEEN AND VOLUME SELECTION
NO YEAH OKAY OKAY
YEAH UM
MM-HMM
UM
I THINK BECAUSE IT'S SO SMALL IT MIGHT BE AN UH I MEAN IF WE ONLY HAVE LIKE TWO THREE BUTTONS IT MIGHT BE ESSENTIAL TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT
YEAH
SPEAKER YEAH
W THOSE LITTLE KEY RINGS HAVE BOTH SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I CAN GIVE YOU THE FREQUENCY WHAT PEOPLE WHAT OPTIONS PEOPLE USE MOST OFTEN
I GUESS THAT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT IN THE TS DEFINING THE THE SOFTWARE SIDE OF THE INTERFACE RIGHT
YOU WANT THE STUFF
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
SURE
SURE
MM
SURE
'KAY
YEAH
TRANSMITTER
HOW DID WHERE DID WHERE DID YOU GET ALL YOUR IN INFORMATION
OH
AH OKAY
YEAH
UH I WAS STILL WORKING ON STUFF I HADN'T GOT IT FINISHED
UM ALRIGHT
CLICK TO SAVE IN WHERE DO I HAVE TO SAVE IT
UM WHAT I'VE DONE WITH IT I'M SORRY
SHIT
UM
I'M JUST CLOSING IT NOW
WHERE I'VE SAVED IT
THAT'S IT THERE YEAH
OH RIGHT
UH RIGHT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING DESIGN UH THIS IS BASICALLY THE INSIDE GOING ON OF THE
THE UH REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE HAVE THE ENERGY SOURCE WE HAVE THE USER INTERFACE THIS THIS IS WHAT I'VE SEEN
UH THE SENDER WILL PUSH THE BUTTON THE CHIP WILL RESPOND UH AND THEN THE DIG DIGITAL SIGNAL IS SENT TO THE T. V.
SO UH
UH IF YOU GO TO NEXT SLIDE YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL SEE UH WHAT DO WE NEED ON THE USER INTERFACE
DO WE NEED UH MANY BUTTONS OR DO WE NEED L MANY LIGHT BULBS THAT COULD BE EASIER TO UH TO REALISE WHICH APPLIANCES ARE ON OR NOT
UM OR WOULD THAT TAKE TOO MUCH POWER WOULD WE NEED MORE UM COMPONENTS IN THERE TO SUPPLY THE POWER
UM THE JOYSTICK IS ANOTHER THING IF WE WERE GONNA ADD THAT UM THERE'D BE MORE COMPONENTS TO DEAL WITH THAT
UM SO UH WE NEED TO I DUNNO EXACTLY WHAT
THAT'S THE DESIGN OF THE THE THE LAYOUT OF THE UH ELECTRONIC DESIGN
BUT UM OBVIOUSLY THERE'LL BE MORE DETAILS ONCE WE'VE DECIDED WHAT WE'RE PUTTING ON THE USER INTERFACE
SO THAT'LL BE DECIDED I GUESS
UH AND THE NEXT SLIDE
OH YEAH
UM IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THEN
I JUST USED THE IT WAS A MESS UH I WAS JUST PUTTING ADDING IT TOGETHER AT THE END THERE
UH
UH SO YOU HAVE THE ENERGY SOURCE OBVIOUSLY CONNECTED TO THE CHIP AND THE USER INTERFACE OBVIOUSLY CONTAINS EVERYTHING
YOU HAVE THE SWITCH TURN IT ON INFRARED BULB
UH WILL CONTACT THE T. V. AND WILL HAVE WHATEVER DEVICE OR D. V. D. PLAYER THE BULB WILL TURN ON TO SAY IT'S ON
UH SO DO WE NEED ON THE CONTROL UH DIFFERENT BUTTONS TO DECIDE OR DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS WOULD IT BE EASIER
UM I DUNNO WHAT WE SHOULD DECIDE ON THAT
NO IT'S FINISHED YEAH
COST
MM
L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE JUST TELLING YOU WHAT'S ON OR UH INTERACTIVE L. C. D. OR
DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL GET MIXED UP LIKE THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT THIS SCREEN AND THAT SCREEN AND THEN
YOU KNOW TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING WORKING WOULD IT BE A BIT CONFUSING
YEAH
YEAH
WE'RE JUST SAYING VOLUME
SHOULD VOLUME BE IMPORTANT IN THE JOYSTICK DO YOU THINK
YEP
I
YEAH THINK SO
LIGHT BULB AS WELL NO
AND A LIGHT BULB
NO
TO FLASH
NO
NAH YOU'D SEE IT ANYWAY IF YOU HEAR IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO I SHOULD JUST LOOK AT UM THE SPEAKER THE SPEAKER AND AN L. E. D.
AND
YEAH AND A TRANSMITTER
P
FASHION
THE SLOGAN IS YEAH THE SLOGAN'S WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS ISN'T IT
'S ALSO LOOK COOL
YEAH THAT'S ME
MM
THERE'S ALSO A WATCH MOVES AROUND A GREAT DEAL MORE
MM
MM-HMM
MM
UM I'M ACTUALLY GONNA BE BOLD AND GO OO GO STRAIGHT FOR RUBBER UM FOR REASONS I'LL GO INTO UH IN MORE DETAIL
MM
YEP
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO WORK BETWEEN THE UH THE SLIDES AND THE UH
AND THE WHITE BOARD 'CAUSE I ACTUALLY I HAVE SOME FAIRLY CONCRETE THINGS
THIS TIME
UH UM I WAS GIVEN A
AN H. T. M. L. FILE GIVING UM VARIOUS IDEAS FROM UH FROM OTHER PREVIOUS REMOTE CONTROL DESIGNS AND PRETTY MUCH DECIDED TO JUST DUMP THEM ALL
I WASN'T VERY IMPRESSED BY THEM AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO RE UH NOTHING I SAW SEEMED TO MEET THE SORTS OF DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING FOR TODAY
UM SO WHAT I RA RATHER THAN LOOKING AT OTHER REMOTES UH RA OOMP BE BETTER TO SIMPLY LOOK AT THE HUMAN HAND
UM AND TRY AND F UM AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT A WAY OF LAYING OUT THE ELEMENTS WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED ON
UM SO THAT IF R A IF SO THAT THE FINGER IS E EACH FINGER OR THUMB IS WHEREVER IT NEEDS TO BE ALREADY
UM SO UH NEXT SLIDE IF YOU PLEASE
UM AND WHAT WE'VE BASICALLY DECIDED ON WAS THE THE UM THE JOY UH THE JOYSTICK
TWO FUNCTION BUTTONS AND THE L. C. D. JUST KEEP IT PAIRED DOWN TO THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM
I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED THE UM THE NUMERIC KEYPAD BECAUSE IF YOU M BECAUSE ONE OF THE MENUS THAT WE COULD HAVE AVAILABLE UM V VIA VIA THE L. C. D. IS ONE WHERE YOU SCROLL THROUGH CHANNELS
SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING F AND BE BEAR IN MIND SINCE THIS ISN'T MEANT TO WORK FOR UM
F F F FOR DI FOR DIGITAL OR UM OR FOR OR FOR CABLE WHATEVER YOU'RE BASICALLY LOOKING AT FOUR OR FIVE TERRESTRIAL CHANNELS
AND THEN UM YOUR V. C. UH AND THEN THE CHANNEL THROUGH YOUR V. C. R. AND OR D. V. D. PLAYER
AND OR UM BOX
SO IT'S NOT I'M NOT REALLY EXCESSIVELY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
YOU MUST HAVE TWO TWO MODES BASIC MODE WHERE UM THE JOYSTICK'S UH LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT FOR CHANNELS
UP DOWN FOR VOLUME UM AND THE UH UH AND THE MENU MODE FOR UH FURTHER FUNCTIONS
UM NOW THE REASON I WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN USING RUBBER FOR THIS IS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HIGHLY ERGONOMIC DESIGN
UM IT NEEDS TO BE ERGONOMIC FOR LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE
UM SO YOU
MM-HMM
YES ABSOLUTELY
UM BASI BASICALLY WHAT I BASICALLY WHAT THE WHAT BE HAVING UM I WOULD SAY THE THE WHOLE THING ARTICULATED AT TWO POINTS
SO THAT IF YOU IF YOU'RE HANDING IT FROM A LEF UH LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USER YOU CAN ADJUST IT SO THAT THE UM THE L. C. THE L. C. D. AND THE UH
THE JOYSTICK WOULD BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AND ALSO THIS IS A RATHER NICER DE UH DESIGN GIMMICK THAT THE THE UM YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING YOU KNOW IT SHOULD HAVE SORT OF ORGANIC FEEL TO IT THAT IT SHOULD BE
YOU KNOW SOFT TO TOUCH AND
CAN BE MOVED AROUND ALL NICE
UM OKAY ON TO ON TO THE NEXT UH TO THE NEXT SLIDE
OKAY
YEAH 'KAY BASICALLY UM
I CAN ADD PRETTY PICTURES TO THIS
THE UM
ASSUMING THE HAND THE HAND TO BE IN ABOUT SORT OF THIS POSITION UM HOL UH HOLDING THE REMOTE
THE UM THE JOYSTICK UNIT SHOULD REST OVER THE UH THE JOINT OF THE F OF THE UH FOUR FINGER SO THAT IT'S DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE FOR THE THUMB
UM AND IT WOULD NEED T THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A IT WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED JUST BELOW THAT SO THAT IT COULD BE SWITCHED AROUND FOR UH LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USERS
SO
YOU THEN HAVE A GRIP SECTION THAT CAN BE MORE OR LESS THE SAME IRRESPECTIVE OF HANDEDNESS
YOU JUST HAVE BIG TWO BIG BUTTONS THAT COVER MOST OF THE AREA SO IT CAN IN THE UPPER PART
ONE FOR THE FOUR FINGER ONE FOR THE MIDDLE FINGER
UM AND THAT
TH THIS PART HERE IS THE JOYSTICK
THIS WOULD BE THE ACTUAL GRIP
PROBABLY WHERE YOU'D WANT TO HAVE THE BATTERY AS WELL
THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY THE BULKIEST PART
AND YOU THEN HAVE AT THE UH AT THE BOTTOM THE L. C. D. AND THIS WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED AS WELL
AND BASICALLY I'D WANT THIS TO REST HERE RIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE WRIST
SO IT WOULD FIT JUST NICELY IN THE HAND
AND AGAIN THIS PART COULD BE
ROTATED SO IT CAN
SO SO SO THAT IT CAN BE ADJUSTED TO EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED USER
UM
SO THE T UH THE TOP FUNCTION BUTTON IN BASIC MODE WOULD BE THE ON OFF SWITCH AND MENU MODE WOULD BE THE ENTER BUTTON
AND THEN THE BOTTOM FUNCTION BUTTONS SWITCHES BETWEEN BETWEEN MODES
UM NOW PROGRAMMING IT ACTUALLY THI THIS IS ONE THING I'VE FOUND WITH UM THE REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL
PROGRAMMING THEM CAN BE A RIGHT PAIN
SO I THOUGHT TH THE SIMPLEST WAY AROUND THAT WOULD BE TO HAVE UM
A CABLE TO CONNECT IT TO THE COMPUTER SOME SOME FAIR IV FAIRLY FAIRLY SIMPLE SOFTWARE ON THE COMPUTER JUST SO THAT YOU ON YOUR COMPUTER JUST SO THAT YOU COULD UM PR PROGRAM IT AT A RATHER IN A RATHER MORE COMFORTABLE INTERFACE
AND YOU COULD DOWNLOAD PROGRAMS FOR IT FROM UH FOR UH T. V. S FROM ALL SORT OF MAIN MANUFACTURERS
UM THOUGH YOU I IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO HAVE UH HAVE A M UH HAVE A HA HAVE A MODE FOR PROGRAMMING IT WITHOUT THE COMPUTER
UH JUST IN CASE THERE ARE THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE LEFT OUT THERE WHO DON'T HAVE THEM YET
UM
BUT UH
YEAH
THAT'S THAT'S MY IDEA
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH ACTUALLY IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CHANNELS THE NUMBER KEYPAD CAN BE QUITE ANNOYING AS WELL
BECAU IT'S YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT UH YOU KNOW WHAT NUMBER'S THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL OR WHATEVER
IT'S JUST IRRITATING
BUT IF YOU H BUT BUT BUT IF YOU HAVE A ME BUT IF YOU HAVE A MENU STRUCTURE THEN YOU CAN SUB GROUP THEM
SO YOU
YEAH
YEAH I I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY
I MEAN I MEAN I MEAN THE THE IDEA OF HAVING IT SORT OF ARTICULATED I TH THERE WOULD BE BASICALLY TWO POINTS OF ARTICULATION
W UM ONE BELOW AND ONE ABOVE THE M THE UH THE MAIN SORT OF GRIP
SO
MM
I D I DON'T THI I DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A A STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS
I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A FIRM S SUB STRUCTURE YOU CAN THEN INCORPORATE ARTICULATION INTO THAT
IF YOU THEN HAVE A SORT OF OUTER SKIN OF MM FLEXIBLE SPONGY RUBBER THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW VERY MUCH YOU KNOW
ORGANIC AND I THINK WOULD LOOK RATHER CO I MEAN MI RATHER COOL
I MEAN MY DRAWING THERE DOESN'T DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE
IT MAKES IT MAKES IT LOOK MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A VIBRATOR THAN A THAN A UH THAN A REMOTE CONTROL BUT UH
MM-HMM
MAKE IT HARDER TO LOSE AS WELL
I TH UH I MEAN IF IT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD PERHAPS BE PROGRAMMABLE THOUGH MAYBE HAVE MONKEY AS DEFAULT
UM
MM-HMM
WELL BASI BASICALLY THE UM FOR F FOR UH I MEAN E EACH MANUFACTURER WILL HAVE A PARTIC WILL HAVE A PARTICULAR COMMAND SET THAT UH THE T. V. RESPONDS TO
IT'S NOT SIMPLY A MATTER OF FREQUENCY
SO UM
USUALLY WHAT'S DONE IS YOU HAVE THIS BIG BOOKLET FULL OF DIFFERENT POSSI YOU'LL HAVE ALL OF THEM SORT OF PROGRAMMED IN TO THE UH REMOTE
AND YOU'LL HAVE THIS LITTLE BOOKLET OF CODES YOU THEN FIND YOUR UM MA UH FIND YOUR MANUFACTURER AND TRY THE DIFFERENT CODES THAT
COME UNDER THAT MANUFACTURER'S NAME 'TIL YOU FIND THE RIGHT ONE
IT'S
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
SO THAT'S THAT'S QUITE ANNOYING AND WE PROBABLY WOULD STILL HAVE TO DO THAT
BUT IF WE HAD UM SOME SORT OF HOOK UP TO YOUR COMPUTER AS AN OPTION THEN IF YOU'VE GOT A COMPUTER YOU CAN AVOID THAT
RATHER IRRITATING THING
YEAH
YEAH
UM BOOKLET
SOME PAGES
YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT'S A BUT IT'S A NUISANCE
AND IT'S A NUISANCE VERY CLOSE TO THE TO UM TO ACTUALLY PURCHASING IT SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE THINKING ABOUT
IF YOU IF THERE'S W I IF THERE'S ONE IN THE SHOP THAT'S THAT SAYS IT CAN AVOID MUCH OF THAT NUISANCE YOU MIGHT BE FAVOURABLY INCLINED TOWARDS IT
UM MM
MM
UM WELL I I THINK OTHER THAN GE GETTING A SORT OF MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING FORM FOR IT
UM MO MOST OF THE SORT OF LAYOUT DESIGN DECISIONS ARE ARE MADE I WOULD SAY
UM BUT THEN AGAIN THE UM THE MENU STRUCTURE TO TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT THAT'S GONNA VARY ACCORDING TO THE MODEL OF TELEVISION
AND ALSO ANY CUSTOMISATIONS THAT THE USER MIGHT WISH TO INCORPORATE
SO UM AND ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT HAVING AN L. C. D. AND A MENU STRUCTURE IS THAT THERE IS THAT FLEXIBILITY TO IT
YEAH
MM
YEAH I MEAN IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
THE OTHER THING I MEAN IT I MEAN IT WOULD NEED TO HA IT WOULD NEED TO HAVE UM SOME SORT OF ON BOARD MEMORY ANYWAY
UM F FOR ONE FOR ONE THING BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THE MENU SYSTEM SHOULD BE UM UH I MEAN ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TERRIBLY COMPLICATED IF IT'S JUST CONTROLLING ONE DEVICE THE MENU SYSTEM OUGHT TO BE UM
O OUGHT TO BE CUSTOMISABLE AND UH
MM-HMM
HOW UH HOW UH HOW YOU WANT SAY THE UM THE THE MENU STRUCTURE FOR FLICKING THROUGH CHANNELS IF YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF CHANNELS
THAT SORT OF THING
YEAH
ARE WE GOING TO BE SUPPLIED WITH THE CLAY IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE IS THE CLAY
MM-HMM
MM
I TH I THINK I WOULD LARGELY WANT TO ACTUALLY STEER CLEAR OF THE WHOLE SORT OF FRUIT AND VEG THING
BU BUT UM BUT THE SPONGY IDEA I LIKE
I LIKE IT A LOT
I HAVING IT I HAVING IT SORT OF BR BRIGHT YELLOW I THINK THAT'S QUITE A GOOD IDEA THOUGH MAYBE WE COULD HAVE OPTIONS FOR COLOURS AS WELL
AND AGAIN THIS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING HARDER TO LOSE
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
I WAS LIKE LIKE I SAID BEFORE I I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE R. R. ON THE UH ON THE TOP FUNCTION BUTTON
ALRIGHT YEAH
CRACK ON
OKAY SO WE'LL START OFF WITH A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE MINUTES
I THINK TO SUM UP THE LAST MEETING WOULD BE TO SAY UM THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'VE UM SET OUT
THOSE ARE WE WERE GOING TO GO FOR WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FAIRLY MINIMAL DESIGN BASED ON UH A SMALL JOYSTICK
L. C. D. AND A COUPLE OF OTHER BUTTONS FOR NAVIGATION UM WITH POWER BEING I SUPPOSE ONE OF THE MAIN SINGLE PURPOSE BUTTONS
UM WE WERE ALSO GOING TO USE NOVELTY OF BEING ABLE TO LOCATE THE REMOTE CONTROL AGAIN VIA A SMALL TRANSMITTER WITH ANY LUCK
THE IDEA TO TRY AND SEPARATE US AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE MINIMAL DESIGN
UM LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE FAIRLY ADVENTUROUS IN THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL SHAPE OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH ANY LUCK
UM THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP THE LAST ONE
SO WE'LL JUST CRACK ON UM LIKE TO MAYBE START WITH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER IF IT'S POSSIBLE
UM UH THE CON TODAY IS THE CONCEP TODAY
THIS UH MEETING IS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE AND IS UM
SORRY ABOUT THIS
AND IS TO COVER THINGS LIKE UM WHAT THE PARTS MIGHT BE MADE OF UM
CAN WE UH OUTSOURCE THESE FROM ELSEWHERE UM WILL WE HAVE TO CONSTRUCT ANY ITEMS OURSELVES
YEAH OKAY WELL I'LL JUST UH I'LL LOAD IT UP THEN
UM
WHICH ONE DO Y
OH INTERFACE CONCEPT
THAT'S YOU
WE'VE GOT TREND WATCHING THAT'S YOU
COMPONENTS DESIGN
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
NOW THE KINETIC ONE WE'VE 'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONES WHERE LIKE YOU THE MOVEMENT CAUSES IT
UM THE BAT UH THE BATTERY FOR A A WATCH WOULDN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF POWER WOULD BE MY ONE QUERY
IS A KINETIC ONE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPLY ENOUGH POWER
DO YOU THINK
W
WHICH I SUPPOSE AS WELL WOULD ALLOW US TO GO OFF THE SHELF AGAIN YOU'D SAY
UM
UM
CURIOUS
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D BE ABLE TO OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD OR NOT THE SINGLE CURVED AND DOUBLE CURVED
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE
UM COULD YOU MAYBE DRAW SOMETHING
I YOU DON'T DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT IT'S JUST 'CAUSE I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO
SO IT MIGHT LITERALLY JUST BE OKAY
ALRIGHT
MM
OKAY THAT WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE CAN TALK ABOUT
UM SO YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THE CHIP THAT WE MIGHT REQUIRE AS WELL
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA SO FAR
LIKE WHEN WE'RE SAYING THAT WE'D NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR AN L. C. D. DOES THAT IN SHOOT THE COST UP BY A DRASTIC AMOUNT
OR
WELL I THINK COMPARED TO SAY JUST PRESSING BUTTONS
IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON THAT SENDS A CERTAIN TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE INFRA RED WHEREAS I THINK IF WE'RE CONTROLLING THE L. C. D. WE DEFINITELY REQUIRE A MUCH MORE POWERFUL CHIP
JUST COMPARED TO THE CHIP YOU WOULD USE FOR PUSHING BUTTONS I THINK IS THE THE POINT BEING MADE
IF I'VE NOT OVER STEPPED
YEAH
OKAY UM SHOULD I GO ON OR GO BACK
WELL WE'D ALSO BE RELYING ON THE UM THE BULK BUYING IN PRODUCEMENT AND SUCH
I ASSUME
WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE COSTS OF THOSE
SO SORRY
OKAY
OKAY
UM
SO IN THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN SUPPLIED HOW FEASIBLE WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE IDEA OF USING AN L. C. D. LOOKS
UM I MEAN THAT SOUNDS LIKE QUITE A GOOD REQUIREMENT TO ME
UM CONVENTIONAL BATTERY WOULD SEEM TO MAKE SENSE
UM I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANY COST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SINGLE AND DOUBLE CURVED AND I'M I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE
BUT PLASTIC OR RUBBER AS A TRADITIONAL FORM OF CASING WOULD SEEM TO BE A GOOD WAY FORWARD
OKAY
OKAY WELL UM
YEAH WELL WILL WE MOVE ON TO USER INTERFACE AND YEAH
UM SORRY AS LONG AS WERE YOU
YEAH
OKAY
UM AND D D D INTERFACE CONCEPT
YEAH
CAN I JUST JUMP IN SLIGHTLY THERE
THAT WOULD SUGGEST THE DOUBLE CURVED DESIGN'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE MOST APPROPRIATE THEN
OKAY
MM
OKAY
UM YEAH
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE'LL PROBABLY BE QUITE TIGHT FOR TIME AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT A LOT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY I GUESS
OKAY
EXCELLENT RIGHT
UM UH
FILE OPEN
TREND WATCHING
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL UM I WOULD SAY THAT THE MOST YOU COULD PROBABLY HOPE FOR IS GAINING A YEAR'S LEAD ON MOST PEOPLE ANYWAY
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BRING OUT NEW DESIGNS SO IF WE CAN GET NEXT YEAR THEN THAT'S POSSIBLY A GOOD PLACE TO START ANYWAY
UM
SEEMS LIKE A A LOT OF THE COMPONENTS COULD BE OFF THE SHELF SO I DON'T EXACTLY WHAT COST WOULD BE INCURRED
UM I CAN SEE YOUR POINT ABOUT THE NUMBER KEYPAD
BUT I'VE I WOULD SAY THAT WE CAN PROBABLY INCORPORATE IT INTO THE MENU SYSTEM IF YOU NEED TO DO TRAVERSAL OF A LARGE NUMBER OF CHANNELS
MY FEELING WOULD BE THAT EVEN IF AT A LATER DATE THIS WAS TO BE TAKING CONTROL OF UM BOXES AS WELL UM HAVING THE USE OF THE L. C. D. AND THE JOYSTICK WOULD PROBABLY ALLOW YOU TO MANIPULATE ENOUGH CHANNEL NUMBERS FOR YOU TO BE
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME IS WE'LL USE A LARGE NUMBER OF STANDARD COMPONENTS UM
SAY SOMETHING LIKE UM LITHIUM ION BATTERY THE KIND THAT YOU FIND IN MOST UM SMALL HAND HELD DEVICES NOW
UM
LOOKS LIKE WE GOING FOR A DOUBLE CURVED DESIGN
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT COST IMPLICATIONS THERE ARE IN THAT
UM LOOKS LIKE WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DECIDED ON SOME KIND OF FLEXIBLE RUBBER
THOUGH I'D HAVE TO SAY DEPENDING ON HOW FLEXIBLE IT IS WE MIGHT NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF INNER FRAME
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY WAY WE COULD MAYBE REMOVE THE ARTICULATION
I CAN SEE WHY IT LOOKS APPEALING BUT IT COULD BE A WEAK POINT IN UM THE STRUCTURE DO YOU THINK
THAT WOULD BE A WORRY OF MINE
YEAH WE WON'T ADD THAT FUNCTIONALITY
HOWEVER ONE INTERESTING POINT IS I DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS YOU WERE THERE
BUT WE IF WE TAKE SOME OF THE IDEAS WHY DON'T WE MAKE THE DAMN THING YELLOW TO INCORPORATE THE DES THE COLOUR OF THE LOGO
I DUNNO
IT'S AN CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT COLOUR FROM YOUR AVERAGE UM
THAT'S TRUE
WAS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR RESEARCH
MM-HMM
AN INTERESTING POINT IS THAT IF THE PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THE COMPUTER WE CAN STILL MAKE THE PROCESS EASIER BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO LOOK UP CODES
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE IT THAT ONE OF THE OPTIONS THEY HAVE IS THAT THEY LOOK UP THE NAME OF THE COMPANY ON THE L. C. D. AND THEN THEY MAYBE LOOK UP DIFFERENT NAMES OF UM DIFFERENT ACTUAL UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED
OR WE HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL JUST GO THROUGH THEM UNTIL IT'S LIKE DOES THIS DO THE CORRECT FUNCTION AND SUCH
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE USED VERY OFTEN THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
OKAY THIS JUST TO GIVE US A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE MEANT TO BE DOING FOR THE NEXT STAGE
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT YOU GOT THAT ANYWAY
THIS IS THE CONCEPTUAL ONE
UM
I THINK WE'VE COME UP I THINK WE'VE COVERED EVERYTHING WE NEED TO HERE
UM I THINK WE'VE DECIDED ON WHAT YOU KNOW DECIDED ON STANDARD ITEMS FOR MOST OF UM RUBBER AND SUCH
SO WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT THE DETAILED DESIGN AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING FOR THE NEXT MEETING
UM
SO FOR EXAMPLE UM I'LL JUST START AT THE TOP
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF AND THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER GONNA BE WORKING QUITE CLOSELY AT THIS STAGE 'CAUSE IT'LL BE HARD NOT TO OBVIOUSLY
UM
LOOKING FROM PROTOTYPING OF SOME DES DESCRIPTION USING CLAY
UM I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE TOLD A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT AS UH PROGRESS
UM
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
THEY'RE KIND OF IT LOOKS THEY'RE THE IDEA I'VE PUSHED FORWARD SO FAR IS MAYBE MORE OF A PHYSICAL ONE THERE
WHEREAS POSSIBLY BE MORE INTERESTED IN MAYBE HOW THE L. C. D. 'S GOING TO INCORPORATE DO YOU THINK
OR DO YOU S PERCEIVE THAT MOST THE DESIGN DESIGN DECISIONS STILL NEED TO BE BASED ON THE PHYSICAL LAYOUT
MM-HMM THAT'S VERY TRUE
UM
OKAY
UM GOT PRODUCT EVALUATION AS WELL
UM
I I THINK WE'D BE YEAH NO
IT'D BE MORE A CASE OF HOW DO WE ENVISAGE US PERFORMING THE PRODUCT EVALUATION ONCE WE HAVE A MODEL TO TEST WITH
UM SO IT'D BE A CASE OF DO YOU THINK THAT JUST BRINGING USERS IN TO HAVE THEM TEST IT OUT
UH MAYBE PUTTING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PRODUCTS INTO THE FIELD IN CERTAIN PLACES WHICH I SUPPOSE IS QUITE SIMILAR
OR JUST KIND OF HITTING THE STREETS AND YOU KNOW SAYING THIS IS A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LOOK OF IT
UM
I THINK THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY UNDER THE AGE OF SAY MAYBE SIXTY OR SOMETHING LUDICROUS
UM THE REASON I'M SAYING THAT IS WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT A A REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL
SOMETHING THAT'S STYLISH SO MAYBE YOU'RE EVEN JUST MAYBE YOU'RE NARROWING DOWN YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE SIMPLY BY SAYING
IF THEY'RE BUYING IT THAT OFTEN OR THEY'RE MAYBE LOOKING TO REPLACE SOMETHING THEN
THEY'VE GOT A BIT OF FREE CASH SO THAT PUTS THEM POTENTIALLY IN THE YOUNGER AGE BRACKET
MAYBE EVEN SINGLE JUST FOR THE REASONS OF UM UH EXCESS CASH FLOW
ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I MEAN AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS I DON'T THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT CHARGING THE EARTH FOR THE UH DEVICE
THINK THAT'S WELL WITHIN THE NORMAL BRACKET
UM YOUR IDEA OF THE U. S. B. WOULD I THINK WOULD LARGELY DEPEND ON THE COST
U. S. B. 'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THE CHEAPEST INTERFACES OUT THERE
BUT IT MIGHT PUSH THE COST OF THE OVERALL UNIT UP 'CAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE NOT JUST THE CONNECTION BUT THE CHIP FOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE REST OF THE SYSTEM
THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE TO BE BASED ON
THE THE IDEA WAS THAT MAYBE IT COULD CONNECT UP FOR UM ALLOWING A SOFTWARE INTERFACE ON THE P. C. FOR A LARGER PROGRAMMING DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE'VE GONE FOR SUCH A NICE
EASY MINIMAL DESIGN NORMALLY
UM
IT'S JUST FOR T. V. BUT FOR
PROGRAMMING IT TO USE YOUR T. V. YOU MIGHT HOOK IT UP TO THE P. C.
I I'M NOT SURE BUT I'M THINKING MAYBE THAT THE ADDITIONAL COST OF THE U. S. B. MIGHT BE PROHIBITIVE
WE DON'T KNOW UNLESS IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO
MM-HMM
W
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO
I WOULD SAY TO
UM AND WE'D BETTER BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE TIME AS WELL
WE'VE ALREADY HAD THE FIVE MINUTE WARNING SO
UM
I WOULD SAY YEAH
INTERNATIONAL WOULD MAKE SENSE
UM YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT PRODUCT EVALUATION
I'M I'D BETTER START WRITING UP A HELL OF A LOT OF CRAP
UM YOU'RE GONNA LOOK A BIT MORE AT THE KIND OF THE PHYSICAL MAKE UP YOU SAY
UM LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA NEED A MAYBE A KIND OF PROTOTYPE IN CLAY
UH WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES
UM
SO UM DO I THINK WE'VE GOT AN IDEA OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO FOR THE NEXT MEETING WOULD YOU SAY
YEAH I WOULD S THAT WOULD BE MY MY FEELING
WE SEEM TO HAVE QUITE A GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT THE IDEA OF THE THE R RUBBER COULD BE QUITE
YEAH
SO WE ALWAYS NEED TO REMEMBER THAT SOMEWHERE WE'RE MEANT TO BE GETTING THE SLOGAN ON
POSSIBLY I'M THINK I'M NOT SURE BUT I'M SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE AROUND MAYBE THE JOYSTICK AREA WHICH COULD BE USED
UM
OKAY
AND I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL REALLY
RIGHT
SEE EVERYBODY IN A HALF HOUR
UH
COST IS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
TITANIUM THE REALLY STRONG METAL TITANIUM
IS IT NOT ALSO IT'S EXPENSIVE
TWO CURVES
NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR THE L. C. D.
IS THAT DID I
ADVANCED LIKE THREE EIGHT SIX ADVANCE
OKAY
OKAY SURE
MM IF WE ONLY HAVE TWELVE POUNDS FIFTY
TWELVE EUROS NOT EVEN TWELVE POUNDS
TWELVE EUROS WHAT'S THAT LIKE EIGHT POUNDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT NINE POUNDS
OKAY THAT'S GOOD POINT
I ALSO HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR RUBBER
BASED ON MY RESEARCH
DIGITAL
IS THIS THE JOYSTICK
OKAY
MM
MM
'KAY
WE GO
OKAY
SO UH TO GATHER MY RESEARCH TWO BASIC METHODS
WE COMPARED UH WHETHER PEOPLE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO DO A LOT OF STUFF OR THEY WANT IT TO LOOK COOL
AND THEN WE WE RESEARCH UH FASHION TRENDS IN EUROPE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE NEW BLACK YOU KNOW AS IT GOES
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
UH WE FOUND IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE PEOPLE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO LOOK COOL MORE THAN THEY WANT IT TO TO BE COOL
AS IN THEY WANT IT TO DO A LOT OF GOOD S THEY WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE IT DOES A LOT
AND IF IT DOES DO A LOT THAT'S A BONUS BUT THEY DON'T CARE SO MUCH YOU KNOW
THEY WANT IT TO BE THAT'S SOUNDS A BIT LIKE A CONTRADICTION
TECHNOLOGY TECHNICAL TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
PEOPLE WANT IT TO BE THAT BUT S STILL THEY CARE MORE ABOUT THE WAY IT LOOKS THAN WHAT IT DOES
SO LIKE THE INTERFACE IS REALLY IMPORTANT
AND EASY TO USE
IT IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT UH FROM THE SECOND POINT TO THE THIRD POINT IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT I MEAN THE SECOND POINT IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE THIRD POINT
PEOPLE WANT IT
I IS IT HAS TO BE COOLER THAN EASY TO USE YOU KNOW IF IT HAS THE NEWEST FEATURES
EVEN IF IT'S DIFFICULT TO USE PREFER IT TO HAVE THE NEWEST FEATURES
AND IF IT'S EASY TO USE THAT'S A BONUS
THE FASHION NOW THIS IS SEEMS A BIT ODD TO ME
BUT FRUIT AND VEG IS THE NEW IS THE NEW BLACK FOR FURNITURE FOR CLOTHES FOR SHOES
HOW THAT RELATES TO A REMOTE CONTROL I DON'T KNOW
BUT I I SEE I COME ON TO THAT IN THE NEXT IN THE NEXT SLIDE
SPONGY
I'VE ALS I'VE BEEN SAYING EVERYTHING'S THE NEW BLACK
WELL SPONGY'S THE NEW BLACK AS WELL
SO WE HAVE THE CHOICE BETWEEN RUBBER AND PLASTIC
IF IT'S THE TYPE OF RUBBER THAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE YOU KNOW IT'S SPONGY THEN CAN I SKIP THE REST
OKAY
OKAY SO KINDA SPONGY MATERIAL
SO UM SO MY PERSONAL OPINION
UM WE WANT SOMETHING FANCY AND TECHNI TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE OBVIOUSLY
BUT WHAT WE WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THE FUTURE THAT LOOKS COOL THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT
YOU KNOW THAT'S EVERYONE HAS A WHITE REMOTE CONTROL BLACK REMOTE CONTROL YOU NEED SOMETHING COOL
LIKE TITANIUM IS COOL BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE
AND MAYBE IT'S A BIT OF OVERKILL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
UM NOW THE FRUIT AND VEG OPTIONS EITHER WE WE GO IN THAT DIRECTION OR WE STAY TOTALLY AWAY FROM IT
UM I MEAN THE RESEARCH DID COME UP WITH FRUIT AND VEG SO MAYBE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR IT'S THE UP TO THE INTERFACE GUY
SO IF WE STAY AWAY FROM IT S YOU KNOW STAY AWAY FROM IT
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA GO ALONG WITH IT THEN IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE LIKE AN APPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR A KIWI FRUIT
IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE
I SAY POTATO PEELER BUT I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE A HAVE A MUCH COOLER IDEA THAN I DO
SO I THINK COOL IS THE KEY
FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT A SPONGY REMOTE CONTROL
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE
I'VE SEEN PLASTIC REMOTE CONTROLS
I THINK MAYBE THEY WERE
I DON'T KNOW BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THEY FIRST CAME UP WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THEY HAD A REASON FOR IT BEING
STURDY YOU KNOW
FOR BEING STRONG AND STURDY
SO UM IF WE WANT SOMETHING STRONG AND STURDY I SAY STAY WITH PLASTIC OR TITANIUM BUT IF WE GO WITH SPONGY
WE CAN STRESS THAT YOU CAN DROP THIS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S SPONGY MATERIAL IT'S NOT GONNA BREAK YOU KNOW
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THE L. E. D. AND THE LIGHTS ARE GONNA FIT INTO A SPONGY MATERIAL BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE COMPLETELY SQUEEZABLE
SO HOW DO THINGS FIT IT
AND IF WE ARE GONNA USE SPONGY WE CAN SAY IT'S LONG LASTING YOU KNOW IT'S DAMAGE RESISTANT AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO
SO JUST TO SUMMARISE PEOPLE WANT STUFF THAT'S COOL THAT'S THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COOL
AND IF IT IS COOL THEN THAT'S A BONUS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE UM PEOPLE LIKE FRUIT AND VEG
WE CAN EITHER GO DOWN THAT ALLEY OR STAY TOTALLY AWAY FROM IT
PEOPLE LIKE SPONGY MATERIAL
IF WE'RE GONNA USE SPONGY MATERIAL WE HAVE TO THINK OF HOW PRACTICAL IT IS AND HOW WE CAN FURTHER PROMOTE THAT IDEA
AND ALSO THIS WAS THIS YEAR
SO THINGS CHANGE ALL THE TIME EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW THEY THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR THIS IS THE NEW BLACK
WELL NEXT YEAR SOMETHING ELSE IS GONNA BE THE NEW BLACK AND WE'RE STUCK WITH LAST YEAR'S FRUIT AND VEG TYPE STUFF
'KAY
THAT'S ME
THAT'S A GOOD POINT
YOU CAN INCORPORATE NAMES INTO THE MENU
OKAY
EVEN NEWS MUSIC
LIKE THEY DO ON UH SKY DIGITAL KINDA
YEAH
OKAY
COURSE NOT
SURE YEAH
SURE
THE NOISE FOR WHEN YOU LOSE THE BANANA UM F YEAH
FOR WHEN YOU LOSE THE REMOTE CONTROL IT COULD BE LIKE A A MONKEY NOISE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT RATHER THAN A STANDARD BEEP BEEP
Y YOU KNOW YOU LOSE THE MONKEY THE BANANA
Y YOU LOSE THE BANANA YOU PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU HEAR LIKE MONKEY SCREAMS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO DIRECT YOU TOWARDS THE BANANA
S OH I WAS GONNA TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMMABLE REMOTE CONTROL
NOW I THINK IT'D BE COOL IF YOU HAD ONE REMOTE CONTROL THAT COULD WORK WITH ALL T. V. S
YOU KNOW YOU S YOU CLICK A BUTTON AND IT FINDS THE FREQUENCY THAT
WORKS WITH YOUR PARTICULAR TELEVISION
BUT WHY YOU'D NEED TO PROGRAM IT LIKE AS AS A STANDARD FEATURE I I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THAT'S BECAUSE TELEVISIONS THEY DON'T GIVE THE REMOTE CONTROL ANY TYPE OF FEEDBACK WHEN YOU SEND IT
OKAY
IS IT IS IT ACTUALLY A BOOK OF NAMES TO DIGITS OR IS IT LIKE A FEW PAGES
I WAS JUST THINKING IF WE WERE TO STORE THIS INFORMATION SOME TYPE OF MAPPING
THIS PERSON PROBABLY NEED TO USE THIS FEATURE LIKE ONCE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU FIRST BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL
OR WHENEVER THEY BUY A NEW TELEVISION SO ONCE EVERY S
YEAH AND IT'S
MM
MM
MM
YEAH YOU SEE I DON'T SOME OF THESE THINGS KINDA LOGICALLY FOLLOW THE OTHERS
HOW CAN T PRODUCT EVALUATION DOESN'T THAT COME AFTER ACTUALLY SEEN
A PRODUCT PROTOTYPE
OH THAT'S THE OKAY SURE SURE SURE
MM-HMM
OKAY SURE
AT THIS STAGE WE STILL HAVE NO NO TARGET AUDIENCE OR
'KAY
AND IT'S STYLISH
MM-HMM
MM
YEP
OKAY
PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY AS WELL
FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE'VE W DEFINITELY TALKING SOME TYPE OF
DIFFERENT
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME TYPE OF FLASH MEMORY OR SOMETHING
WELL SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO REDO THE WHOLE THING ONCE THE BATTERIES ARE CHANGED YOU KNOW ONCE YOU TURN OFF THE POWER
YEAH
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES UH DIFFERENT SKINS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SURE
I IF IT WAS CUSTOMISABLE AS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND STUFF THAT DOES OPEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE INTERNATIONAL RIGHT
SO
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF YOU COULD
OKAY
YEAH
THE FRUIT AND VEG
THIS ONE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SURE
I MEAN WE ARE TRYING TO PROMOTE A REMOTE CONTROL BUT WE WANNA KEEP THE COMPANY BRAND AS WELL SO
I THINK SO TOO
SA
UH UH OKAY
I'LL JUST
UH I HAVE A PRESENTATION I JUST SAVED IT IN THE UH THE FOLDER
UH
IT'S UH
COMPONENTS DESIGN
ALRIGHT
SO
UH
THE CASE UH LE THAT'S WHAT I WROTE FIRST OF ALL COULD BE PLASTIC OUR PLASTIC
UH BUT LATER ON WE FOUND OUT THAT UM IT CAN BE RUBBER AS WELL OR TITANIUM OR EVEN WOOD
SO UH WE DECIDE WHAT IT'S GONNA BE
PROBABLY PLASTIC
UH
WE NEED THE INFRA RED TRANSMITTER
GET THAT OFF THE SHELF
UH JOYSTICK WE'LL PROBABLY IF WE'RE GONNA USE IT UM COULD BE
PLASTIC W OR RUBBER EVEN AS WELL
UM
IF YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE
UH
IF YOU GO ON TO F UH FINDINGS IT'S LIKE TWO OR THREE SLIDES DOWN
RIGHT
SO THIS IS WHAT I FOUND WE CAN USE
UH
THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BATTERIES
UM
CAN EITHER USE A HAND DYNAMO OR THE KINETIC TYPE ONES YOU KNOW THAT THEY USE IN WATCHES OR ELSE UH A SOLAR POWERED ONE
UM
YEAH
UH
YEAH I DON'T THINK IT WOULD
UM
AND SOLAR CELLS I DUNNO ABOUT THAT
UH
WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST USE CONVENTIONAL BATTERIES
UM
JUST LIKE IN USUAL REMOTE CONTROLS
UM
YEAH
UM
AND THESE ARE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OR TWO DIFFERENT TYPES THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHAPES YOU CAN HAVE
UH ONE IS A FLAT ONE AND THEN MORE ORIGINAL ONES ARE SINGLE CURVED ONE OR ONE WITH A DOUBLE CURVED
UM THE MATERIALS ARE THA THERE AS YOU CAN SEE BUT UH YOU CAN'T HAVE A TITANIUM ONE FOR A DOUBLE CURVED UH WHICH WOULD BE
YEAH AND LIGHT
UH I THINK SO AS WELL YEAH
THEY MAKE MOUNTAIN BIKES OUT OF THAT DON'T THEY
SO IT'S REALLY LIGHT AS WELL
UM
T YEAH
UH
WELL
FOR A CURVED WELL I WAS THINKING TO F FOR TO SIT IN YOUR THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
UH MAYBE LIKE THIS WITH THE UH JOY PAD HERE
JOYSTICK HERE
AND MAYBE
UM
AN OKAY BUTTON AROUND HERE SO THAT THE THUMB CAN UH USE IT QUITE EASILY
UM I DON'T EXACTLY
DOUBLE CURVED
IT PROBABLY MEANS THIS IS PROBABLY DOUBLE CURVED
UH WHEREAS A SINGLE CURVED WOULD BE
LIKE THAT
I GUESS
OR NOT NECESSARILY
YEAH LIKE THAT
WHEREAS THIS IS TWO CURVES
UM
SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN BY UH DOUBLE CURVE
UM WHICH OBVIOUSLY IT LOOKS BETTER THAN THE SINGLE CURVE BUT UH YOU CAN'T HAVE IT IN TITANIUM WHICH IS
UH
A NICE MATERIAL
UH
AND FOR THE BUTTONS UM IT CAN HAVE THE SCROLL WHEEL WHICH THEY USE IN MOUSES FOR COM P. C. S
UH BUT
UM IT REQUIRES A
MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP TO USE AND IF YOU WANNA USE L. C. D. IT'S EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE
SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE THERE'S TRADE OFFS THERE
UM
IF YOU WANT THE BUTTONS TO BE OH YEAH IF YOU HAVE A DOUBLE CURVE UH CONTROL AND IT'S RUBBER THEN YOU HAVE THESE RUBBER BUTTONS AS WELL
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HA I RECKON YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE UH KEY A NUMBER KEYPAD ANYWAY FOR THE AMOUNT OF CHANNELS THESE DAYS
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS TO GET TO THE ONE YOU WANT
YOU WANNA ENTER JUST THE NUMBER OF IT IF YOU KNOW IT
SO
UM I RECKON WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A NUMBER KEYPAD ANYWAY
DO YOU THINK
YEAH
SO
DEPENDS WHERE
GONNA SPEND THE MONEY
IF YOU WANT THE F FANCY L. C. D. DISPLAY
YEP
YEAH I
UM
UH THE PREVIOUS SLIDES JUST EXPLAIN WHAT'S IN THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL
IF YOU GO TO THE ONE BEFORE THAT UH SO IT JUST SAYS WHAT IT DOES
TRANSLATE THE KEY PRESS INTO AN INFRA RED SIGNAL AND THIS IS RECEIVED BY THE T. V.
UH THE CHIP JUST NEEDS TO DETECT THE SIGNAL OR DETECT THE KEY PRESS AND THEN UH IT'LL SEND IT TO THE TR THE AMPLIFIER
AND UH THEN THE NEXT SLIDE JUST SHOWS HOW THE UH COPPER WIRES
UH INTERACT WITH THE BUTTONS THE RUBBER BUTTONS UH
TO UH GET SENT TO THE CHIP
SO THAT'S JUST HOW THE CONTROL WORKS INSIDE
UM WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHAT
BUTTONS WE'RE GONNA USE
UM
I THINK WE CAN DO IT IF UH WE USE CONVENTIONAL BATTERIES AND NOT HAVE SOLAR CELLS OR KINETIC
UM AND THEN
MAYBE USE SINGLE CURVED UH CASE
BECAUSE WE MIGHT NEED IT TO BE CURVED FOR THE UH
THUMB TO USE THE JOYST JOYSTICK EASILY
UM
AND THEN YOU'LL NEED THE ADVANCED CHIP OBVIOUSLY FOR THE L. C. D.
YEP I'M FINISHED
AH OKAY
OH YEAH I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT
THE UH RUBBER MATERIAL IS THE TYPE OF STRESS BALL MATERIAL NOT JUST NORMAL RUBBER
FORGOT TO SAY THAT
YEAH
IF YOU'RE GOING WITH THE FRUIT AND VEG THING LOOKS LIKE A BANANA
F IF YOU WANNA DESIGN IT THAT WAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
MONKEY
THE U. S. B. FOR WHICH
OH RIGHT OKAY
BUT DIDN'T THEY JUST SAY IT'S JUST FOR T. V. OR ARE WE GONNA
OKAY YEAH
THEY'RE GOING WITH THE FASHION THING LIKE THE DESIGN SPONGY RUBBER
YEAH
OKAY IT'S A
I THINK IF WE BOTH STEP UP AND UH
OUTLINE OUR IDEAS
OKAY
NOW
DO UH DOING THE PROTOTYPE GAVE US A BIT MORE INSIGHT INTO THE ERGONOMICS OF THE DESIGN
UM FOR ONE THING
IT TURNED OUT THAT THE ONLY POINT AT WHICH IT NEEDS TO BE ARTICULATED FOR HANDEDNESS IS UM IS H I IS DOWN HERE FOR THE UH L. E. D.
AS IT TURNED OUT THE WHOLE THING TRANSFERS FROM THE RIGHT TO LEFT HAND FAIRLY WELL FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF OPERATING THE UH FUNCTION BUTTONS AND JOYSTICK
THOUGH IT MIGHT BE AN IDEA TO BE ABLE TO A ADJUST THE POSITIONS FOR THE BASE OF THE JOYSTICK JUST A LITTLE BIT FOR UH
JU JUST A THOUGHT
YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE A SLIGHTLY OVOID SHAPED JOYSTICK THAT COULD THEN JUST BE TURN UH TWISTED ROUND
SO THAT THE UH STICKY UH SO THAT THE BIT THAT STICKS OUT A BIT MORE IS ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
BUT AS YOU AS YOU SEE WITH THE UH WITH HOLDING IT IN THE LEFT HAND
THE L. UH THE L. C. D. IS NOWHERE USEFUL SO THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ARTICULATED
UH IF WE'RE GOING TO RETAIN ERGONOMIC DESIGN
UM NOW I I GOT YOUR NOTE ABOUT UH KEEPING THE COST DOWN
YEAH
THIS DESIGN COULD BE DONE WITH UM
WITH UH PLASTIC CASING
THOUGH I WOULD RECOMMEND AROUND THE GRIP PART HERE IN THE MIDDLE
HAVING MAYBE JUST A RUBBER GRIP OVER THAT WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR A SLIGHTLY MORE SORT OF BIO MORPHIC FORM AND A BIT MORE ERGONOMIC AS WELL
AS FOR THE UM
AS FOR THE SINGLE CURVE
UM WELL THIS EDGE AND THIS EDGE LIKE I SAY IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME CURVATURE TO IT BUT IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
REALLY THE CURVE THAT'S MOST NEEDED IS THE UNDERSIDE SO THAT THE JO SO THAT THE JOYSTICK RESTS OVER THE THE EDGE OF THE HAND LIKE THIS
UM AND YOU HAVE
THE UH TRANSMITTER HERE AND A WEE SPEAKER FOR THE UH FOR THE UH FOR THE UH FI UH FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL FINDER
SO
ANY FURTHER COMMENTS
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN THE UH YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN WITH THE WITH THE RUBBER DESIGN IT COULD I YOU KNOW IT COULD PRETTY MUCH MOULD VERY MUCH TO THE TO THE USER'S HAND
ONE NICE WEE FEATURE IF WE COULD IF WE COULD STILL DO THE RUBBER
I THOUGH OF WAS TO HAVE THE UH RUBBER EXTEND BEYOND THE END OF THE UH OF THE RIGID SUBSTRUCTURE
SO IT HAS A WEE SORT OF TAIL THAT YOU JUST DRAPE OVER YOUR WRIST SO IT STAYS IN POSITION NICELY
MM
LOVELY
UM
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S STILL PART OF THE DESIGN
MM
MM
AND MAKING IT A BRIGHT COLOUR HELPS WITH THE PERSONALLY I WOULD HAVE GONE FOR PURPLE
MM-HMM
I'D SAY NUMBER ONE
I THINK W IF IT WAS JUST THE SOUNDER THEN TH I MEAN SOMETHING I'VE FOUND WITH UH W W WITH SAY TR TRYING TO FIND UH A CORDLESS PHONE OR A M MOBILE
YOU CAN HEAR IT BUT YOU CAN'T QUITE PIN IT DOW PIN DOWN WHERE IT IS
BU
YEAH
MM-HMM I SUPPOSE O ONE THING THAT COULD BE DONE IS H IS HAVE IT UM CIRCULAR AND HAVE IT S SO THAT THE UH THE PINK ACTUALLY GOES A BIT OVER THE PINKIE FINGER
MM
SO THAT UH TH
MM
MM
YEAH
MM
MM
I THINK IF WE REMOVE THE THE L. C. DISPLAY THEN THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO POINT TO ANY OF THESE MEETINGS AND WE JUST WE COULD JUST PUT OUR BRANDING ON ANY OTHER REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
UM YEAH I MEAN ONE THING I MEAN HO UH HOW MUCH EXTRA WOULD IT BE TO TO KEEP I MEAN KEEP THE UM THE ARTICULATION
THIS IS WHAT I'M WONDERING
OH NO I THINK I I IT D THAT IT NEEDN'T REQUIRE IT TO BE DOUBLE CURVED
IT'S UH IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S JUST THAT THE CASE WOULD COME IN T WOULD BE MADE IN TWO PARTS AND THEN JOINED TOGETHER WITH AN ARTICULATION
MM
YEAH I MEAN AND I MEAN THE UH I MEAN IF YOU LOOK UH IF YOU LOOK CLOSER AT THE UH AT THE PROTOTYPE HERE
THE LINES HERE ALONG THE GRIP
ARE ACTUALLY QUITE STRAIGHT
UM I MEAN YEAH ON THE ON THE L. C. D. I MEAN ALTHOUGH WE'VE DONE IT WITH A CURVE IT COULD JUST AS EASILY BE DONE UM WITHOUT CURVES
THE CURVE THAT'S REALLY NEEDED IS UP HERE
TO PUT UH TO KEEP THE JOYSTICK IN A GOOD ERGONOMIC POSITION FOR IT TO HAVE IT REST ON THE TOP OF THE HAND
MM
MM NO THAT'S THAT VOICE RESPONSE THING THAT WE GOT THE EMAIL ABOUT
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY POINTLESS
YEAH
ALRIGHT
B I BASICALLY IT WAS SAYING THAT OUR LABS HAD COME UP WITH A CHIP THAT YOU COULD
YOU KNOW SAY HELLO TO AND IT WOULD SAY HELLO BACK IN A FRIENDLY FEMALE VOICE
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY WELL L LET'S SAY THAT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE OUR SPECIAL COLOURED CASE AND THEN WE AT LEAST HAVE MAKE IT A LITTLE HARDER TO LOSE
BECAUSE MOST M MOST REMOTES ARE A FAIRLY DINGY COLOUR THAT GETS CAMOUFLAGED UNDER ANY PILE OF CRAP IN A LIVING ROOM
OR GREY
YELLOW
OKAY
THREE
I THINK WE CAN DO THREE
TH THE SPECIAL COLOUR DOESN'T WOULD I THINK MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IT MAKES IT STAND OUT FROM YOU KNOW IT'S LOST IN A BIG PILE OF CRAP IT STANDS OUT FROM THE REST OF THE CRAP
TWO BUTTONS AND A JOYSTICK
TOTALLY
IT DOESN'T GET MUCH FANCIER
MM
MM
I'D GIVE IT A THREE FOR THIS FOR THAT
YEAH
I MEAN THE MENUS THING IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T NORMALLY SEE ON UM ON A REMOTE BUT YOU SEE IT IN A LOT OF OTHER PLACES
MM-HMM
I'D GIVE IT A THREE
MM-HMM
I'D S I I'D GIVE IT A SIX TO BE HONEST
WELL I I I WOULD SA I WOULD SAY GIVE A S GIVE A SELECTION OF COLOURS
UM WE WENT WITH YELLOW WE WENT WITH YELLOW FOR THE PROTOTYPE 'CAUSE WE HAD YELLOW
IF I WERE BUYING ONE I'D GO FOR PURPLE
LEOPARD PRINT WOULD BE COOL
THAT'S KINDA
I IT WON'T BE WHEN IT'S BEEN
BUDGETED
I I THINK S I I THINK THIS ISN'T NOT PARTICULARLY FRUIT AND VEGGIE
UM
MM
I'D I'D I DON'T THINK FRUIT AND VEG IS THE SOLE CRITERION
IS THE SOLE CRITERION FOR BEING UM FASHION FASHIONABLE OR INSPIRED BY CURRENT FASHIONS
UM I'D G I'D RATE I'D RATE THIS FAIRLY HIGHLY FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW ACTUALLY
MM
MM
PERSONALLY
I THINK GIVEN THAT
THE PRODUCT UM
ONLY REPLACES A SINGLE REMOTE CONTROL THAT YOU'VE ALREADY GOT
ARE PEOPLE REALLY GONNA SHELL OUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR SOMETHING THAT'S ONLY MARGINALLY GOOD
MM-HMM
I S I SUPPOSE ONE THING IS THAT B BECAUSE IT'S TECHNICALLY INNOVATIVE
UM FOR SOMEONE WHO'S SORT OF TECHNOPHOBIC THE FACT THAT IT SIMPLY LOOKS UNFAMILIAR WOULD BE DAUNTING
UM
YEAH GOT NOTES AND DOODLES
WELL I THINK THIS IS A I THINK THE DIGITAL PEN'S MOSTLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UH
OF THE RESEARCHERS STUDYING THIS
IT'S ALL P GOES INTO THEIR CORPUS
THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFER THE UM
TRANSFER OUR N OUR PAPER NOTES ONTO THE UH
COMPUTER OURSELVES
UNTI UH UH UNTIL UH UNTIL ACCOUNTS CAME ALONG SQUISH
YEAH
MM
I MEAN I TH I MEAN I THINK TO R RETAINING THE S THE MORE SORT OF BIO MORPHIC FORM IN THE ARTICULATION WOULD GAIN MORE IN S UH WOULD GAIN MORE PROFIT IN SALES THAN IT WOULD LOSE IN UH
IN ADDED EXPENSE
SUCH AS IT IS
ACTUALLY I WANT TH ONE THING I WOULD SAY I MEAN SOMETHING THAT COULD PERHAPS BE PART OF THE PRODUCT MM THE UM M PRODUCT TESTING MARKET RESEARCH PROCESS WOULD BE TO UH PRODUCE MOCK UPS OF BOTH VERSIONS AND SEE JUST HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE THE OVER GOING OVER BUDGET
UM M WOULD MAKE TO SALES
AND WE COULD EVEN YOU KNOW MARKET TWO VERSIONS
WEE CHEAPIE VERSION WITH THE NICE BIO MORPHIC RUBBER
YES
MM
AND I CAN GET MY BUS
OKAY
THANK YOU
THAT SHOULD HOPEFULLY DO THE TRICK UM
'KAY
SORRY ABOUT THE SMALL DELAY
FALLING A LITTLE BIT BEHIND SCHEDULE
AND THAT'S UH FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE
OKAY
SO JUST TO TRY AND ROUGHLY GO OVER WHAT WE AGREED IN THE LAST ONE UM
WE'RE GONNA GO FOR SOMETHING UH UH HOW WAS IT
UH THE NEW BLACK I BELIEVE
UM SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD 'CAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE IN PREFERENCE TO ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY IN THE END THOUGH WE SHOULD NEVER AVOID FUNCTIONALITY OF COURSE
UH MANY OF OUR COMPONENTS ARE GONNA BE STANDARD OFF THE SHELF
BUT IT SEEMED LIKE WE WERE GONNA REQUIRE AT LEAST AN ADVANCED CHIP AND WE WERE STILL VERY MUCH FOR THE IDEA OF USING AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
UM OTHER THINGS WERE WE WERE HOPING TO USE RUBBER MOST LIKELY GONNA BE DOUBLE CURVED ETCETERA
OKAY
SO UM DUE TO YOUR HARD WORK WE MIGHT AS WELL LET THE UH TWO DESIGNERS GO FIRST AND UH SHOW US THE PROTOTYPE
QUITE HOW THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS I'M NOT SURE BUT
OKAY
I'M AFRAID YEAH
WE'LL GO INTO THAT A BIT MORE BUT PLEASE GO ON
MM
OKAY YEAH
GREAT
UM
YEAH OKAY
EXCELLENT WORK
UM
YEAH I BELIEVE SO
SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COULD ACTUALLY STOP A REMOTE BEING LOST 'CAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE HUMAN ELEMENT
BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'VE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT FINDING THE DAMN THING ONCE WE HAVE
MM
UM
JUST BEFORE WE GO THROUGH ALL OF THE STEPS HERE UM WELL WHAT WE'LL DO IS
UM IF WE CAN LOOK AT THE CRITERIA YOU'RE GONNA EVALUATE AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE PRODUCT EVALUATION IF THAT'S ALRIGHT
YEAH IS THAT
UM SO IS THERE ANYTHING HERE THAT YOU
THAT YOU WANTED TO COVER AS IN THE CRITERIA THAT YOU'VE COVERED
AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK PRETTY MUCH PROMPTLY TO THIS
I IS THERE ANY OF THESE CRITERIA THAT NEED ANY EXPLAINING
OR IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOUS THOUGHT THA REALLY WOULD STAND OUT COMPARED TO THE OTHERS
OKAY
OKAY
NO AND WHICH WE WILL DO VERY VERY SHORTLY
UM
OKAY
SLIGHT PROBLEM WE HAD WAS THAT WE HAVE AN AMAZING FOUR EUROS OVER BUDGET FOR WHAT WE WERE HOPING TO DO
UM MOST OF IT STEMS FROM THE USE OF THE L. C. D. WHICH I THINK IN THE END ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF OUR EXPENDITURE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE REQUIRED A CHIP AS WELL
UM THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS DOWN WAS EITHER TO DITCH THE A L. C. D.
AT WHICH POINT WE'VE REMOVED A LARGE PART OF HOW WE WERE GONNA INTERFACE REQUIRE MORE BUTTONS ETCETERA
OR WHAT WE DID WAS THAT WE UM WE AS IN I AS I WAS QUICKLY GOING OVER IT WAS ALTERING THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE
UM CHANGING IT TO PLASTIC AND A SOLID UNIT WITH A SINGLE CURVE DESIGN WOULD ALLOW US TO COME BACK INTO THE UM PROPOSED COSTS AND WE'RE JUST SCRAPING IT IN
WE'VE GOT POINT TWO OF A EURO LEFT OVER THERE
SO WE'RE JUST MANAGING IT REALLY
EVEN THEN AS WELL UM THERE WAS NO CRITERIA TECHNICALLY DEFINED FOR A JOYSTICK SO I'VE USED WHAT I THINK'S APPROPRIATE
WITH ANY LUCK THAT WON'T MEAN THAT WE'VE INCURRED MORE COST THAN WE CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO
IT BLOWS A LOT OF OUR REALLY GOOD IDEAS KIND OF SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A U. S. B. CONNECTION IS DEFINITELY NOT VIABLE NOW
UM
THAT SHOULD STILL BE VIABLE
WE'VE GOT AN ADVANCED CHIP WE'VE GOT THE USE OF THE L. C. D.
SO BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES IS STILL VERY MUCH A POSSIBILITY
UM BUT WHAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO DECIDE ON IS HOW WE'RE GONNA GO FROM HERE
WE DO NEED TO TRY AND COME UP WITH AN IDEA WHICH COULD BE CONTINUED WITH OTHER PEOPLE IF NEED BE
UM
WE CAN I CAN BRING THE EXCEL UP SHEET UP AND UH SHOW YOU IF YOU WISH UM
I REALLY THINK AS M MUCH AS IT PAINS ME IS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO WITH PLASTIC AND SOME KIND OF SOLID DESIGN
POSSIBLY MEANING THAT THE L. C. D. WOULDN'T BE IN THIS PERFECT PLACE
IT MIGHT BE S STUCK LIKE SLIGHTLY BETWEEN WHAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR LEFT HANDED AND WHAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR A RIGHT HANDED PERSON
OKAY
IT VERY MUCH IS ABOUT MAKING CONCESSIONS UNFORTUNATELY
UM
UM B B B DA IS YOU MEAN ON THE PLASTIC OR
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
YOU NOW HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I DO
UM
SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE FOR EXAMPLE THE BATTERY
REALLY NOT VERY LITTLE CHOICE IN THAT ONE
WE'VE GONE FOR ONE OF THE CHEAPER OPTIONS AS WELL
UNFORTUNATELY WE REQUIRE THE ADVANCED CHIP IF WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT WE'RE NEEDING TO
I'VE SAID SINGLE CURVED
WE REALLY DO NEED IT TO BE THAT WAY FOR THE ERGONOMICS OF IT
UM PLASTIC FOR SOME REASON INCURS NO COST WHICH I'VE HAD TO VERY MUCH MAKE ADVANTAGE OF
DESPITE THE FACT THAT RUBBER'S ONLY GOT A VALUE OF TWO EUROS PER UNIT
PROBLEM COMES HERE AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE INTERFACE
UM
IF I'VE READ THIS THING CORRECTLY THEN WE CAN SAVE POINT FIVE OF A EURO HERE IN THAT IT'S NOT PER PUSH BUTTON
THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THEN A NUMERIC KEYPAD WOULD COME IN AT UM WHAT
FOUR POINT FIVE EUROS WHICH IS AN AWFUL LOT SO THAT COULD WELL BE WRONG
EVEN IF WE SAVE POINT FIVE THERE IT WOULD JUST MEAN THAT WE'RE MOST LIKELY PLACING IT IN ACTUALLY JUST GAINING A COLOUR FOR THE UNIT
WHICH HAS HAD TO BE PUT TO ONE SIDE
AS YOU CAN SEE
THE USE OF AN L. C. DISPLAY UM ADVANCED CHIP AND WHAT WOULD DETERMINE THE SCROLL WHEEL HERE AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S AN INTEGRATED SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON THAT WASN'T QUITE WHAT I THINK THEY HAD IN MIND WITH A JOYSTICK
I THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP WITH THE BEAN COUNTERS
UM
AS YOU CAN SEE I MEAN THAT'S TAKEN UP WELL OVER HALF OF THE PRICE
SO UM I'M VERY MUCH OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS OF WHERE WE GO
BUT BECAUSE WE NEED TO SHED WHAT WAS FOUR EUROS OFF OF THE UM THE PRICE OF FOR WHAT WE REALLY DESIRED
THIS ONE COMES IN UNDER PRICE AS YOU CAN SEE BUT THIS WAS THE ONE THAT SACRIFICED THE MATERIAL FOR THE CASE AND FOR THE ACTUAL CASE DESIGN
UH NO WE HAVEN'T NOT
THAT'LL IT LITERALLY WOULD JUST BE A BUTTON
WE MIGHT HAVE TO
IT LOOKS LIKE ALMOST NOTHING
MM
OH GOOD CALL I MISSED THAT
THAT'S A VERY VALID POINT
SO IF WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THE L. C. DISPLAY THEN THAT'S
I BELIEVE SO YEAH
THAT WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE IN KEEPING WITH THE UM THE FASHION STATEMENT AND SUCH YEAH
BEING MANIPULATED BY THE JOYSTICK YEAH
WHICH I'M DEFINING AS SCROLL WHEEL
UM
YEAH IT'S JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ACTUAL DEFINITION FOR WHAT A JOYSTICK MIGHT BE THAT
THAT'S WHAT I'VE LABELLED IT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS EVALUATION
IF WE REMOVE THE L. C. DISPLAY WE COULD SAVE OURSELVES
A FAIR AMOUNT
WHICH YOU COULD
IT'S A SHAME
WE SHOULD POSSIBLY HAVE
IF WE COULD'VE INCREASED THE PRICE WE COULD'VE MANUFACTURED THAT AND WE COULD'VE GOT SOMETHING FAR CLOSER TO WHAT WE WERE HOPING TO
AGAIN YOU'LL HAVE TO ARGUE WITH THE ACCOUNTANTS ON THAT ONE
UM BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS MEETING I'M WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STICK WITH THESE FIGURES
SO
I WOULD SAY THAT IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE GENERAL OPINION IS WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE L. C. DISPLAY 'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT WHAT REALLY SEPARATES US
DESPITE THE COST IT'S GONNA INCUR
UM
ARE PEOPLE MAYBE NOT HAPPY WITH BUT ARE WILLING TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS IN GOING FOR A PLASTIC SOLID CASE TO KEEP THE L. C. D.
IT'S HARD TO TELL
UM I WOULD SAY THAT YOU'RE AT LEAST GONNA TAKE DOUBLE CURVED AND EVEN THEN I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF THAT'S INCORPORATING THE IDEA OF ARTICULATION
SINGLE CURVED WITH ARTICULATION
BUT THE CURVES ALL O OVER HAND IS IT
WE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY SAVE A LOT BY REDUCING IT ANYWAY SO I MEAN FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS MEETING MAYBE WE CAN STATE THAT SINGLE CURVE STILL ALLOWS ARTICULATION
UM UNLESS WE HEAR OTHERWISE WE COULD GO AHEAD WITH THAT PROPOSAL
WHICH IS WHAT WE CAN GET ONTO NOW
AS LONG AS SO ARE WE GONNA SAY W WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE TIME AS WELL BUT WE'RE GONNA SAY UM SINGLE CURVED DESIGN
IT COULD WELL BE BUT AT A COST OF
OKAY YEAH WE'LL DEFINITELY WON'T GO WITH THAT ONE
YEAH THAT'S VOICE RECOGNITION SO
UM
SO OKAY YEAH BATTERY DEFINITELY
IT LOOKS LIKE IT UNLESS WE CAN MANAGE TO PUT IT IN UNDER POINT TWO EUROS UM
MAYBE EVEN SLIGHT WELL OH YEAH PRETTY MUCH POINT TWO EUROS I'D SAY
SO WE'LL LEAVE THAT ONE FOR NOW
WE'LL JUST HAVE
IT'S UH A CASE OF UM
I'M UH SLIGHTLY UNSURE
ONE POINT FIVE OF A EURO FOR ONE PUSH BUTTON DOESN'T SOUND QUITE RIGHT
SO MAYBE IT'S A CASE OF A PUSH BUTTON IS MAYBE ONE OR MORE
UM
AT WHICH POINT IF
WELL YOU GOT POINT FIVE THERE
IT'S LITERALLY A CASE OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS CORRECT
I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF THEY'RE I DON'T THINK THEY MEAN POINT FIVE EUROS PER BUTTON
SO
THERE WE GO
BLACK'S PROBABLY THE NORMAL COLOUR YOU'D SAY YEAH
I QUITE LIKE THAT COLOUR THAT YOU'RE FETCHING THERE IT'S UH DEFINITELY FOR MAKE IT GLOW IN THE DARK EVEN BETTER
SO
WILL WE GO WITH THAT THEN
IT'S NOT AND WE CAN SEE WE'LL COME BACK TO UH YOUR EVALUATION WHICH YOU'RE PROBABLY NOW GOING TO PAN US BUT THERE WE GO
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA UM YOU WANT TO GO MAYBE A BIT QUICKLY AS WELL I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME
WE'VE NOT HIT THE FIVE MINUTE MARK WARNING YET BUT
TEN
MM MM FOUR
THREE
MM
OKAY
TWO BUTTONS
YEAH
I'D SAY WE'RE DOING WELL THERE
MM-HMM
AS HE MODELS THE
I'D
YEAH
WHICH IS A SHAME
MM
I'D BE TEMPTED WITH THREE YEAH
WE'LL GET PANNED ON THE NEXT ONE ANYWAY
YEAH W
IT IS YEAH
DON'T BLAME THEM
UM BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE'VE MINIMALISED THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS AND SUCH
PLASTIC IT SUCKS
BUT IT'S NO WORSE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER PL REMOTE CONTROLS WE HAVE
LIKE YELLOW YEAH
IT WOULD ALSO HELP KEEP THE THE PRODUCT PLACEMENT S YEAH
IS IT INSPIRED BY CLOTHING FASHION
YES
IT'S KIND O IT PROBABLY
WELL I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY MORE FRUIT AND VEG THAN MOST OTHER THINGS OUT THERE BAR FRUIT AND VEG SO WHAT FOUR
IS THAT BEING TOO GENEROUS
OH DEAR
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK YOURSELF
WELL IT'S KIND OF CURVED AND WE CAN MAKE IT YELLOW AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH BANANA LIKE
SI IT'S GOT A CURVE TO IT
AM I DO YOU THINK I'M STRETCHING THE UH THE USE OF THE BANANA
IT'S NOT BAD AND CONSIDERING THE DON'T PICK THE PEN
UM
Y OH AND YOU'VE KNOCKED BATTERIES OUT
UM RIGHT OKAY IT'S CONSIDERING THE PRICE WE HAD TO GET THIS IN
TO HAVE A POSITIVE YOU KNOW EVEN BASED ON THE FOUR OF US BEING HEAVILY BIASED UM
IT WAS GONNA BE QUITE HARD TO GET ANYTHING STANDING OUT I'D SAY POSSIBLY BASED ON
UM THE THE COST FEATURES
MAYBE IT'S BEEN TARGETED
HIDE IT IN THE FRUIT BASKET
PROBABLY THE PEOPLE TECHNOLOGICALLY
THEY'RE USUALLY THE ONES THAT BUY POINTLESS STUFF
MM-HMM
OKAY
UM DON'T KNOW HOW LO MUCH LONGER WE'VE GOT
AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES I THINK
UM QUICKLY WE'LL POP ONTO PROJECT EVALUATION
UM
SO
WE'VE GOT THESE UH FOUR CRITERIA HERE FOR UH SATISFACTION
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO UM
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINIONS ON ANY OF THEM
FOR EXAMPLE UM WE'LL WORK BACKWARDS I SUPPOSE
THE ABILITY TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT USING THE TECHNOLOGY WE'VE BEEN PRESENTED WITH
UM PEOPLE MADE GOOD USE OF THE
UH PEN AND PAPER
I WOULD SAY
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE ADVANTAGE FOR US USING A DIGITAL PEN MIGHT BE
MM
IT MUST
IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE PAPER'S STILL A HEAVY CONSIDERATION FOR TAKING NOTES
SO MAYBE THIS IS LITERALLY JUST A WAY AROUND IT
UM I DUNNO
HOW ARE PEOPLE SATISFIED WITH THE TEAMWORK WE'VE MANAGED TO DISPLAY TODAY
LEADERSHIP
AS MUCH AS CAN BE LEADERED IN THIS UH THING
UM LAST ONE WE'VE GOT IS ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
NOW I THINK WE GOT
YEAH I THINK OF IN THE END IDEAS THAT CAN BE USED SADLY
NOT SO MUCH THAT WE WEREN'T FULL OF IDEAS BUT OF ONES THAT ARE GONNA ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE THING
IT'S A BIT OF A PITY
UM I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE ON THAT
I THINK WE NEEDED A LARGER BUDGET
IF YOU'RE GOING TO AIM YOUR A UM PRODUCT MAYBE AT THE TECHNOLOGICAL KIND OF SECTOR
THEN YOU CAN AFFORD TO MAYBE JACK THE PRICE UP SLIGHTLY FROM WHAT IT IS
BECAUSE THEY WILL PAY OUTRAGEOUS CASH TO
FIRST ON THE MARKET
MM
IT COULD EVEN
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
UM I SUPPOSE THESE ARE ALL THAT WILL HAVE TO BE TAKEN UP WITH A AT A DIFFERENT GROUP AT I GUESS
AS TO A THE COSTS INVOLVED
BUT I MEAN
WE'VE GOT A A PROTOTYPE
SO I DUNNO I I THINK IT'S GONE OKAY TODAY CONSIDERING THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE
HAD AT OUR DISPOSAL AND UM SUCH
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MEAN WE COULD HAVE COME UP WITH A LOT MORE SOLID DESIGN IN THE END I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE
IT IS VERY MUCH A PITY TO UM GET SO FAR INTO THE STAGE AND THEN FIND OUT THAT MAYBE SOME OF YOUR IDEAS ARE JUST A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE
ALWAYS HARD TO TELL UNTIL YOU KNOW THE COSTS
UM
OKAY
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN BUDGET
WELL THEY ARE NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR SLIGHTLY LESS THAN CAPABLE PRODUCT
WE'VE EVALUATED IT AND WE CAN SAY THAT WE CAME OUT WITH A VALUE OF THREE
IT'S YEAH
AND THEN THE FINAL ONE WHERE YOU GET TO CALL IT HAL
BUT WE'LL GO INTO THAT LATER
RIGHT UM IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO TO ADD UM
ANYTHING THEY THINK THAT'S NOT BEEN COVERED BEFORE I QUICKLY WRITE UP A FINAL REPORT
UM I DUNNO I MEAN WE'VE GOT A PRODUCT
WE MAYBE AREN'T AS HAPPY WITH IT AS WE'D LIKE TO BE BUT
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING WE THINK WE CAN MAYBE STICK ONTO THE THE MARKET AND SELL
AND OF COURSE SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN AVOIDING TALKING ABOUT 'CAUSE OF WE'VE NO INFORMATION IS SELLING THEM DIRECTLY TO THE MANUFACTURERS
THERE IS A HUGE MARKET
I MEAN WE'VE BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON IT BUT WE'VE NO MORE KNOWLEDGE THEN THERE'S LITTLE WE CAN SAY ON THAT
YEAH
SO UM UNLESS ANYBODY'S GOT ANYTHING THEY'D LIKE TO ADD
WE CAN MAYBE ROUND THIS UP SLIGHTLY EARLIER THAN WE'D NEED TO AND THEN WE CAN FINISH UP THE WRITING AND SUCH
YEAH
UH THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION
THAT A QUESTION WE CAN ASK
RIGHT
YEAH I'VE GOT A IF YOU LOAD UP MY EVALUATION DOCUMENT
MM
UH EVALUATION
BASIC POINT UH HAVE A LIST OF CRITERIA THAT WE NEED TO RATE THE PROTOTYPE BY
UM THEN WE WILL IT'S A SEVEN S UM SEVEN
SEVEN STEP KINDA EVALUATION PROCESS
SO UM NOT SEVEN STEPS SEVEN SCALE
SO AFTER WE'VE FINISHED DOING ALL THE RATINGS FOR EACH CRITERIA WE AVERAGE THAT AND THAT WILL GIVE US SOME TYPE OF UH CONFIDENCE IN OUR PROTOTYPE
AND UH THE CRITERIA BASED ON REAL REACTIONS' KINDA GOALS AND POLICIES MARKETING STRATEGIES AND ALSO THOSE I PUT TOGETHER FROM THE USER REQUIREMENTS PHASE
'KAY
UM IF YOU FLIP THE
SO THOSE ARE THE CRITERIA
AND UH PERHAPS I COULD HAVE PUT 'EM A BIT BETTER BUT YOU NOTICE A FEW THINGS THAT WE'VE TOTALLY ABANDONED
WHICH MEANS THAT UH THE PRODUCT WILL SCORE VERY BADLY ON SOME OF THOSE POINTS
PUT IT MILDLY
SO WE HAVE UM TRUE
ONE T
SEVEN EIGHT OH
FOURTH
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH EACH POINT
IF WE IMAGINE IT'S ACTUALLY STRAIGHT AND JUST GIVE IT A A SCORE
SO UM HOW WELL WOULD YOU SAY THE PROTOTYPE IS UH HOW WELL HAVE WE REALISED THE DREAM OF BEING ABLE TO STOP REMOTES FROM FROM BEING LOST
OR TO BE ABLE TO FIND THEM ONCE THEY ARE LOST
I MEAN UH IS THE HOMING THING STILL THE LOCATOR IS THAT STILL
SURE
AND ADAM WE CAN KEEP THAT IN
OKAY
SURE
T
SURE
MM
BRIGHT COLOUR
SO WE STILL HAVE THAT NOISE THING YEAH
OS ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN HOW WOULD YOU GUYS RATE IT FOR FINDING FINDING IT ONCE IT'S LOST
NUMBER ONE
OKAY
NUMBER NUMBER ONE FOR THE FIRST CRITERIA
YEAH YOU CAN TELL WHAT ROOM THE MOBILE IS
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU WANNA SAY SOMETHING
THAT'S FINE
OH THAT'S THAT'S FINE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CR IS THERE ANYTHING I WANNA
UM A FEW
SOMETHING I NEGLECTED FROM MY INITIAL RESEARCH IS THAT REAL REACTIONS HAS A A GOAL STRATEGY THAT ALL OF THE PRODUCTS BE INSPIRED BY MATERIAL FASHION AND CLOTHING FASHION
THAT IS WHY FRUIT AND VEG BEING POPULAR IN THE HOME AND IN CLOTHING WAS IMPORTANT AND THEY WANT ALL THEIR PRODUCTS TO BE SOMEHOW INSPIRED BY CURRENT TRENDS IN FASHION
SO THEY SAY WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS WELL THEY REALLY MEAN IT THEY THEY'RE VERY BIG ON FASHION SO
THAT'S THIS BIT RIGHT HERE
AND UH THIS BIT IS THIS ONE EASY TO USE FOR VISITORS OR FOR ANYBODY
I GUESS IT'S JUST THE SAME AS SAYING EASY TO USE INTERFACE SO IT'S KINDA CONDENSED INTO ONE
AND WE CAN COME BACK TO IT YOU SAID
SO
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES
YEAH
MM
DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON HOW MUCH UM DIFFERENT PRINTS COST
I MEAN CAN YOU GET THE ENTIRE THING PRINTED WITH A DESIGN UM
YEAH YEAH
WHY WOULD WHY WOULD THAT BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN AN INDIVIDUAL PUSH BUTTON AND SCROLL WHEEL TOGETHER
THAT'S QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPENSIVE
YEAH
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE UH SPEAKERS HERE
THE LIKE UH WE UH WHAT ABOUT SPEAKERS AND TRANSMITTERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
HAVE WE FACTORED THAT IN
TRANSMITTER RECEIVER SPEAKERS
PLUS THE EXTRA DEVICE ITSELF THAT'S GONNA BE ON A T. V.
IS THAT GONNA BE A BUTTON OR
YEAH
I I MEAN IT'S NOT ON HERE BUT UM
DID THEY S DO WE HAVE TO USE AN ADVANCED CHIP FOR THE L. C. D.
OKAY
WELL THAT'S YEAH
WHAT'S A HAND DYNA DYNAMO
YOU HAVE TO WIND IT UP
TECHNOLOGY
YEAH
OKAY
AND WE COULDN'T REPLACE THE JOYSTICK RIGHT
BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED FOUR EXTRA BUTTONS TO REPLACE IT UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT
AND THAT WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A BUT IS A SCROLL WHEEL NOT JUST BACK AND FORWARD
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
UH K
DOES THIS DOES THIS BEAR IN MIND THAT I MEAN IT'S A BIT RIDICULOUS THAT THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE US
WHAT IS IT LIKE THIS MUCH MONEY FOR THREE MILLION IF WE'RE GONNA BUY THREE MILLION COMPONENTS YOU KNOW
MM
'KAY
I THINK SO
YEAH
COULD WE COULD WE NOT GET RID OF THE CURVY THE CURVOUS THE CURVACEOUSNESS AND FOCUS ON THE MENU BEING THE BEST INTERFACE
'CAUSE LIKE WE DO WE HAVE RE RESTRICTIONS ON SOFTWARE
OH BUT THERE HAS TO BE
JOYSTICK
OKAY
SURE
OKAY MY BAD
SO I THINK THE PRODUCT IS NOT GONNA PERFORM SO WELL FOR MY CRITERIA
OH WAIT A MINUTE
SAMPLE SPEAKER
WHAT IS A SAMPLE SPEAKER
IS THAT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE WANT
YEAH
YOU GOT A EMAIL ABOUT VOICE RESPONSE
I DID NOT SO
WE WON'T GO WITH THAT ONE DID YOU SAY
I MEAN I WE
OKAY OKAY
SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA GET RID OF THE WHOLE LOCA LOCATOR THING
OKAY
OKAY
OH SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE CASE
MM-HMM
W WHAT'S THE DEFAULT COLOUR
WHITE OR BLACK
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
SURE
OKAY
OKAY
SO UH
RIGHT OKAY
OKAY
'KAY
ABILITY TO STOP REMOTES FROM BEING LOST OR TO FIND THEM ONCE THEY ARE LOST
UM
OKAY
SPECIAL COLOUR
UH UH FOUR
THREE IF WE'RE BEING GENEROUS I FEEL
THINK WE'RE BEING GENEROUS HERE WITH THREE
MM
YEAH
OKAY
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNUSED BUTTONS
WE'RE DOWN TO T TWO BUTTONS IS IT
OKAY SO THAT'S A ONE
YOU KNOW WHERE THAT'S
OKAY THAT WAS GOOD
EASY TO USE INTERFACE BUTTONS MENU MENUS THAT'S YEAH THAT'S GOOD
'KAY THAT'S WE'RE NOT DOING SO BADLY
UM EASY TO USE OH OKAY LET'S FORGET THAT ONE
FANCY LOOKING
SURE
AND WE COULD DO WHATEVER WE LIKE WITH THE L. L. C. D.
YEAH LET'S JUST ASSUME IT'S A GOOD L. C. D. DISPLAY
MAYBE I WAS PANICKING FOR NO REASON
YEAH W MAYBE YOU'D BE A BIT TOO YEAH
THERE WE GO
YEAH THAT'S M
THAT'S THAT'S BETTER TOO
MORE ACCURATE NUMBERS
TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
WELL WE'RE GETTING RID OF THE LOCATOR THING WHICH WHICH YEAH
'KAY
YEAH MOBILE PHONES
AND Y WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS MOVING THE MENU FROM THE TELEVISION TO THE REMOTE CONTROL SO IT'S
YOU SAY THREE
I MIGHT GO AS FAR AS TWO ON THAT
THREE
THREE
OKAY
OKAY
MATERIALS THAT PEOPLE FIND PLEASING
SPONGINESS IS WHAT THEY REALLY WOULD HAVE WANTED APPARENTLY
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
IT'S NOT A STEP BACKWARDS
YEAH OKAY LET'S GIVE IT A SIX
OKAY THAT'S TOTALLY THROWN EVERYTHING OFF BALANCE
INSPIRED BY THE LATEST INTERIOR AND CLOTHING FASHION
W WE COULD
WHAT COLOUR WERE WE GONNA MAKE IT
I KNOW BUT
BUT UM BY THIS I THINK IT'S MORE A CASE OF FRUIT AND VEG
YEAH
MM
BUT
TH TH THEY'RE REFERRING TO THE FRUIT AND VEG THING
IS THIS LIKE A BANANA TYPE COLOUR
COULD WE STRETCH NO STILL IT'S NOT SHAPED LIKE A BANANA IS
OH IS THAT 'CAUSE IT'S FLAT
WHAT IS WHAT FRUIT OR VEG IS FLAT
YEAH
OR WE MIGHT HAVE TO SUFFER BADLY FOR THIS ONE AS WELL
FOUR
OH THAT'S IT'S VERY AMBITIOUS YEAH UM
SURE
INSPIRED BY
YEAH
THIS IS THEIR STRATEGY
I M IMAGINE WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME MONEY INVESTED IN THIS AND THE AMOUNT THAT WE INVEST IS GONNA BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE MARKS
MIGHT WE MIGHT WANNA BE A BIT MORE SKEPIBLE SCEPTICAL ABOUT
THIS ONE
I WOULD SAY I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT AT ALL RIGHT
IN ANY WAY OR SHAPE OR FORM
WE DIDN'T M
OKAY THE THE YELLOW BANANA LIKE THING IS I THINK IS OKAY
RIGHT FIVE
IS THAT SOUND REASONABLE
FIVE
YEAH
'KAY SO WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN
SO FIVE SEVEN TEN SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE
WHICH GIVES US AN AVERAGE OF THREE
IT'S WELL THIS WOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE
SO WE IT'S IT'S NOT BAD
IT'S IN THE GOOD SECTION
OOPS
SORRY
I'M I'M SORRY
MM-HMM
YEAH
EVEN IF WE WERE TO INCREASE THIS ENTIRE THING BY BY SEVEN WE WERE TO GO DOWN A GRADE TO TO FOUR
WE WOULD HAVE TO DO I MEAN WE DIDN'T WE WEREN'T THAT KINDA OPTIMISTIC TOO OPTIM OVERLY OPTIMISTIC
YOU KNOW LIKE WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T ADD WE DIDN'T SUBTRACT A WHOLE SEVEN POINTS FROM THESE THINGS SO I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY ON THE GOOD BIT
EVEN IF WE GAVE THIS ONE SEVEN AND THIS ONE SEVEN THAT'S STILL ONLY THREE EXTRA POINTS OVER SEVEN
YOU KNOW IT'S YEAH WE DID IT W IT WAS OKAY
IT WAS GOOD
MM-HMM
I THINK SO
I MEAN MY MUM STILL HAS NOT LEARNT HOW TO USE TEXT MESSAGING ON HER PHONE AND SHE'S HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME YOU KNOW
SHE USES IT TO MAKE PHONE CALLS AND THAT'S IT
YEAH
SO I THINK IF SH IF MY MUM SAW A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE THIS WITH ONLY TWO BUTTONS AND A JOYSTICK
I MEAN THAT'LL PROBABLY BE THE FIRST ONE SHE DECIDES NOT TO BUY YOU KNOW
SHE'D BE LIKE IS THIS A REMOTE CONTROL I DON'T HOW DO YOU USE IT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO EVEN IF IT IS REALLY USER FRIENDLY TO US BUT WE'RE USED TO USING MENUS ALL THE TIME
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT'S TOTALLY UH RADICAL TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH NO NO NUMBERED BUTTONS YEAH
BUT LIKE RADICAL GOOD MAYBE
WROTE NEARLY A PAGE BUT NOT
I THINK TRACKING
YEAH THAT WOULDA BEEN PRETTY GOOD
I'D YEAH I LIKED IT YEAH
I LI YEAH TOP MARKS
WELL YEAH
WE WE'RE NOT LACKING IN IDEAS YOU KNOW IT'S THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MAYBE THE COUNTS WOU WOULDA BEEN BETTER IF WE HAD A LIST OR MORE
YEAH TO BEGIN WITH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
AND LIKE RESPONSE FROM CONSUMERS
SURE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY LET'S
THANK YOU
I WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF UPSET YOU KNOW AT THE BUDGET AND THAT WE HAD TO CUT A LOT OF STUFF
IT'S LIKE MAN WE WE CAN'T HAVE THE LOCATOR THING
AND S YEAH THAT'S JUST BAD
DO YOU THINK MAYBE THE PRICES WERE WERE MADE
UM OBVIOUSLY IT'S GONNA BE BULKIER THAN HOW IT LOOKS BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE FLAT ON ONE SIDE
SO THE L. C. D. WILL BE S STICKING DOWN LIKE THIS WON'T IT
'CAUSE IT YOU CAN'T GET IT CURVED
UH BECAUSE OF COSTS
AND IT'S PLASTIC AS WELL SO IT WON'T BE AS COMFORTABLE ON THE HAND
YEAH
ONE
YEAH
WHAT ABOUT WHAT IF THE THE VOLUME ON THE T. V. 'S TURNED UP MASSIVELY AND UH YOU JUST WANNA TURN DOWN THE VOLUME CAN'T FIND REMOTE
SUPPOSE YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE T. V. AND DO IT MANUALLY
MM
LIKE Y YOU WOULDN'T HEAR THE SPEAKER
MM
THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE ISN'T IT
YEAH
FASHION
SO BASICALLY THE ONLY NEW THING IS THE L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE NOW
OH AND JOYSTICK YEAH
SO
THE L. C. D. BASICALLY IS THE BIG SELLING POINT OF
THE REMOTE
BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT UH ORIGINAL THOUGH ISN'T IT
IT CAN BE S YEAH IT CAN STILL BE SINGLE CURVED BUT
YOU JUST
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED FOR THE JOYSTICK I THINK THOUGH
COSTS FOUR
YEAH
ARE WE GOING FOR A SPECIAL COLOUR AT ALL
WELL I WAS FOR A CASE
OR HAD YOU ALREADY INCORPORATED THAT
THINK IT'S TEN MINUTES LEFT
SPECIAL COLOUR
THREE
ARE WE GOING ONE ON
I'D SAY WE GO TWO 'CAUSE LIKE F THE FANCIEST WOULD BE THE DOUBLE CURVED
WOULDN'T IT
WITH THE ARTICULATORS
WITH BELLS ON IT
NO NEED FOR TELETEXT
FIVE
SIX
SIX
PUT A LEOPARD PRINT ON IT
YEAH WE GOTTA
I'D SAY THE COLOUR OF THE BORDER THERE WORLD YOU'D FIND THAT THAT'S THAT'D STAND OUT
LOGO BRAND
MM 'KAY
YELLOW COURGETTE
WELL THIS THIS WHAT WE'RE GONNA T THIS IS THEIR MOTTO LIKE
AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT DOING WELL ON IT
YEAH I'LL GO WITH FIVE
'S BAD DESIGN THAT THING
MM YEAH
WELL IT DEPENDS WHO YOUR WHO'S WHAT THE TARGET PEOPLE ARE LIKE YOU'D SAY
MAYBE THE FASHION CONSCIOUS
WOMEN WOULD BE GOING OH LOOK AT THAT 'S COOL IT LOOKS LIKE A IT'S
YELLOW LOOKS LIKE A BANANA IT'S COOL IT'S GOTTA LOOK GOOD IN THE SITTING ROOM
RATHER THAN THE L. C. D. WHEREAS UH MORE TECHNICAL LIKE LIKE MORE UH PEOPLE IN WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY IT'S GOOD
IT'S GOT AN L. C. D. SCREEN 'S ONLY GOT TWO BUTTONS AND A JOYSTICK
SO
WHICH WHICH KIND OF PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE
LIKELY TO BUY IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
GOOD
VERY GOOD
WE'RE BURS BURSTING WITH CREATIVITY
AND THE PRICE WAS LIKE IT WAS TWICE THE
W ASSEMBLY COST
AND WOULD IT HAVE TO BE TWICE THAT
IT COULD BE LIKE COULDA HAD THE ASSEMBLY LIKE MAYBE FIFTEEN EURO
WE'LL STILL SETTLE FOR TWENTY FIVE
MAYBE
IN THE BEGINNING YEAH
ALRIGHT SO TWENTY FIVE
SO YEAH I'VE
THE ONLY THE ONLY REMOTE CONTROLS I'VE USED USUALLY COME WITH THE TELEVISION AND THEY'RE FAIRLY BASIC
SO UH
MM
BUT BUT TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE YOU NEED A LOT OF NEAT FEATURES
FOR SURE
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
UH WHAT DO WE THINK A
WHAT DO WE THINK A GOOD SIZE WOULD BE FOR THIS
'CAUSE I I KNOW AS YOU ADD MORE BUTTONS TO THE REMOTE IT SOMETIMES GETS SO BIG AND CLUNKY AND THERE'S JUST LIKE A HUNDRED BUTTONS ON IT
OR YOU COULD HAVE A REALLY SMALL SLIM ONE BUT THEN YOU COULD LOSE IT EASILY
RIGHT
OKAY
WAIT FOR EMAILS
HMM
SLIM
UH YEAH UH
BEING AS A MARKETING EXPER EXPERT I WILL LIKE TO SAY LIKE BEFORE DECIDING THE COST OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL OR ANY OTHER THINGS WE MUST SEE THE MARKET POTENTIAL FOR THIS PRODUCT LIKE WHAT IS THE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET
WHAT ARE THE AVAILABLE PRICES OF THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE PRICES
WHAT SPECIALITY OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS ARE HAVING AND HOW COMPLICATED IT IS TO USE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS AS COMPARED TO OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET
SO BEFORE DECIDING OR BEFORE FINALISING THIS PROJECT WE MUST DISCUSS ALL THESE THINGS LIKE AND APART FROM THIS IT SHOULD BE HAVING A GOOD LOOK ALSO
BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY LI UH LIKE TO PLAY WITH IT WHEN THEY ARE WATCHING MOVIES OR PLAYING WITH OR PLAYING WITH THEIR C. D. PLAYER
M. P. THREE PLAYER LIKE ANY ELECTRONIC DEVICES
THEY REALLY WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING GOOD HAVING A GOOD DESIGN IN THEIR HANDS SO YES ALL THIS
YEAH
YEP
UH
HMM
UH MAKING A PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS
SO IT'S GO GONNA HAVE TO BE BE PRETTY DAMN TRENDY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I WAS THINKING THAT AS WELL
I THINK THE THE ONLY ONES THAT I'VE SEEN THAT YOU BUY ARE THE SORT OF ONE FOR ALL TYPE THINGS WHERE THEY'RE YEAH
SO PRESUMABLY THAT MIGHT BE AN IDEA TO
PUT INTO
YEAH YEAH
UH 'CAUSE I MEAN WHAT UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS THAT'S ABOUT
I DUNNO FIFTEEN POUNDS OR SO
AND THAT'S QUITE A LOT FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
OKAY
THE THE KEYRINGS YEAH YEAH
OKAY THAT'S COOL
OKAY
OKAY
'KAY
SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR
'KAY
WE'RE
SORRY CARRY ON
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
FOR FOR UH REMEMBER WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT FOR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY
OKAY WELL RIGHT WE'LL HAVE TO UM I'LL WE'RE K HAVING ANOTHER MEETING IN HALF AN HOUR SO UM WE SHOULD ALL LOOK INTO A BIT
UH OH ACTUALLY NO WE'LL ALLOCATE
SO YOU DO THE LOOKING AROUND AT OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS
UM IF YOU COULD MAYBE COME UP WITH SORT OF SHAPES AND SUGGESTED SHADES OR WHATEVER AND YOU COULD LOOK INTO UM
BASICALLY HOW HOW IT'S MADE I. E. LIKE HOW YOU MAKE IT ALL IN ONE HOW WHAT SORT OF MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU WHATEVER
AND OBVIOUSLY OTHER INSTRUCTIONS WILL COME FROM THE PERSONAL COACH
WHICH WILL PROBABLY JUST USURP WHAT I SAID SO
SHAPES AND COLOURS AND UM BASICALLY HOW TO MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE
UH
AND YOU LOOK AT COMPETITION AND DESIGN
COOL
SO WE HAVE UH
UM
OKAY GROOVY
AND NO DOUBT WE'LL GET UM
SORRY
WE'LL GET UM WARNINGS FOR NEXT MEETINGS AS WELL
OKAY
I SHALL I CAN'T IMAGINE THESE ARE WORTH MUCH
OKAY
FASHION INTO ELECTRONIC
OKAY
MM 'KAY
MM-HMM
YEAH THE UNIVERSAL ONES
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM IT'S ABOUT THAT
MM
UM WELL MY FIRST THOUGHTS WOULD BE MOST REMOTE CONTROLS ARE GREY OR BLACK
AS YOU SAID THEY COME WITH THE T. V. SO IT'S NORMALLY JUST YOUR BASIC GREY BLACK REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS SO MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT COLOUR
MAKE THAT MIGHT MAKE IT A BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE REST AT LEAST
UM AND AS YOU SAY WE NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF GIMMICK
SO UM I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU LOSE IT AND YOU CAN WHISTLE YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS
BECAUSE WE ALWAYS LOSE OUR REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THEN YOU LOSE IT YEAH
KIND OF UM MAYBE MORE LIKE A P. D. A. KIND OF JUST HAND HELD LIKE 'CAUSE
YEAH
NO I WASN'T NO SORRY I WASN'T THINKING OF THE SCREEN OF LIKE A P. D. A. BUT
OKAY
SO YOU WANT ME TO LOOK AT SHAPES AND EVERYTHING YOU SAID
YEP
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OH NO
SORRY IT'S OKAY
OKAY COOL
IT'S A INSPIRED DESIGN
HMM
OF COURSE
SO UH I NOTICED YOUR TALK ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION AND WHISTLING
AND UH I WAS JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW HAVE WE DONE ANY RESEARCH INTO HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN WHISTLE
UM OR IF IS THAT A FUNCTION WE WANT IN THE REMOTE
I DON'T BUT I I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DO RIGHT
YEAH IT JUST I MEAN IT HAS TO BE A CERTAIN KIND OF WHISTLE TOO RIGHT
THAT'S COSTLY THOUGH
UM A MUCH EASIER THING IS JUST ANY LOUD NOISE LIKE CLAPPING UM SHOUTING YOU KNOW UH AND THEN WHAT WOULD THE RESPONSE BE
IT BEEPS BACK AT YOU OR SOMETHING
OKAY
WELL UH LET ME SET THIS UP
SO I PLUG IT IN PRESS F. FIVE
FUNCTION F. FIVE
OR FUNCTION F. EIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
I THINK IT'S UH JUST TO LOCK IT IN
IT'S GOT IT
OKAY
UM
SO AS THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER MY JOB IS TO TAKE AN INPUT FROM YOU GUYS UM SO IT'S GOOD YOU WENT FIRST
AND I JOTTED DOWN SOME NOTES AS TO WHAT ARE THE B NEEDS AND UH WHAT KIND OF NOVEL FEATURES WE CAN ADD TO DIFFERENTIATE OUR PRODUCT FROM THE OTHERS
UM SO RAJ TOLD US THAT UH CONSUMERS ARE WILLING TO SPEND MORE FOR FANCY PRODUCTS
AND UM HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT UH THE CURRENT PRODUCTS DON'T ALWAYS MATCH USERS' OPERATING BEHAVIOUR
UM A LOT OF THE BUTTONS AREN'T USED AND UH
HE MENTIONED THAT THEY'RE NOT FUN TO USE
AND UH A NOVEL FEATURE WHICH UH WE JUST BROUGHT UP WAS THIS THIS AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION FEATURE OR NOISE DETECTION FEATURE FOR WHEN YOU LOSE THE REMOTE
THERE COULD BE A LITTLE MICROPHONE ON IT
AND ANY NOISE OVER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD UM IT'LL PICK UP AS A A DISTRESS SIGNAL UM FROM YOU AND IT'LL BEEP BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW OH HERE I AM OR SOMETHING OF THIS SORT
OH YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
WELL MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE A
UM HMM THA THAT WOULD BE A CONSIDERATION TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT YES
UM
YEAH WELL THA THAT'S UH FOR LATER DOWN THE ROAD UM AND THEN AS FOR THE USER INTERFACE IT SHOULD BE TRENDY
UM AND NOT COMPUTERY RIGHT SO MORE LOW TECH AND NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS
SO I TOOK THESE ALL INTO CONSIDERATION AND ALSO I HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS FROM THE BOSS
RIGHT UM AND PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS WHICH I KINDA THREW OUT THE WINDOW
AND SO I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH AND UNFORTUNATELY ALL I HAD TO WORK ON WAS OUR UH OUR CORPORATE ARCHIVES OF THE GREAT PRODUCTS WE'VE MADE BEFORE
WHICH INCLUDE YOU KNOW UM SPACE CRAFT COFFEE MAKERS AND BULLET TRAINS
OR UH OR A HIGH SPEED TRAIN
RIGHT AND HAVING PERSONALLY WORKED WITH ALL THESE PRODUCTS UH I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE WITH UH WITH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF THESE
RIGHT
SO
I FIGURED JUST PUT 'EM ALL TOGETHER
YOU GOT A A CAFFEINE POWERED SPACE SHUTTLE TRAIN TRANSPORT TO YOUR T. V. AND UM
AS FOR THE USER INTERFACE PROBLEM YOU KNOW TOO MANY BUTTONS
GIVE IT ONE BUTTON
AND AND IT'S A YOU KNOW FOR THE THE COWBOY IN ALL OF US I I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE THE FUNCTION IS THERE BUT
YEAH IT'S A G I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE A YOU KNOW A
RIGHT
SO I THINK I I MISSED THE BUDGET THING IT WAS FIFTY MILLION EUROS
AND WE GOTTA SELL TWENTY FIVE OF THEM
RIGHT
OKAY
OH OKAY SO I I MIXED THOSE NUMBERS
OKAY
WELL I GUESS MORE REALISTICALLY THEN WE NEED A PRODUCT THAT'S GOT SOME KINDA NIFTY OUTER CASING CHEAP PLASTIC UH
YOU KNOW UM THAT SHOULD BE JUST LIKE UH A TENTH OF THE PRICE MAYBE OR LESS
AN ENERGY SOURCE WHICH'D PROBABLY JUST BE UH YOUR REGULAR BATTERIES UM WE DON'T WANNA HAVE IT
UH
YEAH YEAH WE COULD DO THAT TOO
UM I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT SO SO THE UNIRS THE USER INTERFACE UH THE CANONICAL USER INTERFACE FOR THESE WOULD BE JUST A BUNCH OF BUTTONS
BUT SINCE WE'RE A CUTTING EDGE COMPANY WE UH OF COURSE WILL HAVE ALTERNATIVES LIKE UH SPEECH RECOGNITION WHISTLING RECOGNITION AND ROCKET POWER
BEHIND OUR PRODUCT
UM AND LASTLY THE TRANSMISSION INTERFACE IS UH JUST SOME ENGINEERING THING YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
UM SO HERE'S YOU KNOW A GREAT SCHEMATIC THAT MY UH APPRENTICE DESIGNER GAVE ME
UM AS YOU CAN SEE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL HAVE PARTS AND THOSE PARTS LOOK LIKE THAT AND UM YOU KNOW IT'S GOT A LITTLE OPERATING PROCEDURE THAT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND I SUPPOSE YOU ALL KNOW HOW IT WORKS BECAUSE WE'VE ALL USED IT AND WE WOULDN'T BE IN A COMPANY DESIGNING REMOTE CONTROLS IF WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SO UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES
I THINK UH PROGRAMMABLE OPTIONS WHICH UM JUST REQUIRE A SMALL AMOUNT OF MEMORY UH NON VOLATILE MEMORY
JUST UM SO THE USER CAN PUT IN THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNELS AND MAYBE THEIR PREFERRED VOLUME SETTINGS SO THAT WHEN THEY TURN IT ON IT'S NOT BLASTING
OH OKAY
AND THE UH THE BELLS AND WHISTLES THAT WE MENTIONED YOU KNOW THEY TAKE MORE BUDGETING
UM MORE TECHNICAL UH EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT AND IT'S ALSO MUCH MORE LIKELY TO NOT WORK IF IF WE ADD THESE BELLS AND WHISTLES
THAT'S ALL I GOT
OOH THAT'S TIGHT
OKAY I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO SCREW IT IN
JUST PUSH IT
YELLOW
YEAH YEAH
WELL HMM
OH IT'S
THEY'RE ACT THERE THERE WAS A REMOTE CONTROL THAT CAME OUT TWO YEARS AGO THAT HAD A SOME BASIC SPEECH RECOGNITION ON IT
YOU COULD PROGRAMME IT WITH YOUR CHANNELS AND THEN YOU SAY YOU KNOW LIKE UH B. B. C. ONE AND IT GOES TO THAT CHANNEL
YEAH IT DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL THOUGH BECAUSE OF THIS NOISE INTERFERENCE PROBLEM
THEY MENTIONED YOU KNOW IF THE TELEVISION SAYS YOU ARE LISTENING TO B. B. C. ONE
RIGHT RIGHT AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF THIS
YOU'D BE WATCHING THE T. V. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'D IT'D PICK UP A NOISE AND TURN IT OFF OR YOU KNOW OR TURN THE VOLUME OFF OR SOMETHING
BUT IF YOU CAN WORK AROUND THAT THAT NOISE PROBLEM
RIGHT
RIGHT AND THEN IT WOULD DO JUST YOU KNOW UH SUBTRACTIVE KIND OF CANCELLATION OF THE NOISE
WHAT YOU COULD DO THEN WOULD BE YOU HAVE UH A REMOTE CONTROLLED BY THE T. V. SPEAKER
OR NOT A REMO I'M SORRY A MICROPHONE BY THE T. V. SPEAKER AND A TRANSMITTER THERE THAT SENDS BACK TO YOUR REMOTE
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T UM EXPECT UH THE THE TELEVISION MANUFACTURERS TO TO PUT THAT FEATURE INTO THEIR T. V. S
BUT YEAH THEN YOU HAVE LIKE THE LITTLE SE SEPARATE MODULE BY THE T. V. SPEAKER
WHICH
RIGHT AND THEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD KNOW UM WHAT'S BEING PRODUCED BY THE TELEVISION
RIGHT RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
UM
YEAH THAT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THEN AN ANOTHER THING WAS ABOUT THIS LOSING THE REMOTE AND TRYING TO FIND IT AGAIN
IF YOU DO HAVE THIS SORTA SPEECH INTERFACE TO IT YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO FIND IT
YOU JUST SAY YOU KNOW UM WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU WANT THE REMOTE FOR
YOU KNOW TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR TO UH TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF
YOU JUST SHOUT YOUR COMMAND TO IT AND IT WOULD DO IT FOR YOU IF IT'S WITHIN YOU KNOW WITHIN HEARING RANGE
AND UH YOU KNOW IT COULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM Y THAT YOU'VE NO IDEA WHERE IT IS AND IT WOULD STILL DO ITS JOB
WELL HOPEFULLY WE'RE UH WE'RE AHEAD OF THE CURVE
HMM
UM
MM
YEAH NO TH THE MATERIAL'S CHEAP BUT IT'S JUST UH THE THE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL NEEDS SOME LIGHT TO CHARGE IT YOU KNOW
AND THEN UH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE SITTING IN THE DARK FOR TOO LONG IT UH IT WON'T GLOW ANY MORE
RIGHT
RIGHT
MM-HMM
UM YEAH WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF FEATURES NOW I I THINK
YEAH
WELL I THINK A CONSIDERATION TOO IS THAT THESE UH REMOTES GET ABUSED A LOT YOU KNOW THEY GET THROWN AROUND
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE THE T. F. T. SCREEN WOULD BREAK OR UH GET DAMAGED
THEY'RE PRETTY FRAGILE
YEAH MM
OH
OH NO IT'S IT'S MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE T. F. T. IT'S JUST A MICROPHONE AND SOME SOME INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
AND IT'D IT'D BE A SMALL VOCABULARY SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM LIKE A
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
SO IT SHOULD BE WHEN YOU SAVE
ON YOUR DESKTOP SO IT GOES SAVE AS OR
AND THEN UH HIT THAT LITTLE FOLDER UP THING AGAIN
AGAIN
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP YEAH THAT'S UP TO DESKTOP
RIGHT AND THEN PROJECT DOCUMENTS
MM
DID YOU GET MY EMAIL
OKAY
JUST MAKING SURE
YEAH
WOW
WE COULD GO COMP YEAH
WE COULD GO COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BOX AND MAKE THE THING A BIG RED BALL FOAM BALL
AND IT'S GOT THE THING ON THE INSIDE
AND THERE'S NO BUTTONS AT ALL IT'S ALWAYS ON AND JUST YELL AT IT AND IT WORKS
AND THEN CH CHILDREN WILL LOVE IT
OH YELLOW YELLOW BALL
RIGHT
TWELVE THIRTY
MM
YEP
YEAH I'VE BEEN USING UP THE PAGES
ANOTHER QUESTIONNAIRE
YEAH
YEAH
UM
SO HOW
S
SH DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD IT
SO AFTER THAT
F. EIGHT
F OH SORRY F. EIGHT
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
UH ME AGAIN RAJAN THE MARKETING EXPERT
UH AS WE HAVE DECIDED IN THE LAST MEETING THAT I HAVE TO FIND OUT SORRY YEAH SURE
YEAH YEAH
UH ACTUALLY SORRY I HAVE TO SEE THE OTHER SORRY
YEAH THANK YOU
UH YES I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE UH MARKET POTENTIAL FOR THIS PRODUCT UH LIKE CONSUMER LIKINGS AND EVERYTHING
WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS PRODUCT AND ARE WE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR A NET PROFIT OR OUR AIMS OR NOT
THEN
SORRY
OKAY
YEAH I CAN OKAY
UH THEN UH THE METHODOLOGY I ADOPTED TO FIND OUT ALL THIS WAS MARKET SURVEY
A A DETAILED MARKET SURVEY ON CONSUMERS WAS DONE TO FIND OUT THEIR LIKINGS AND DISLIKINGS
WHAT THEY PREFER WHAT THEY NOT PREFER W WHAT PROBLEMS THEY DO ENCOUNTER IN ALL THIS TYPE OF THINGS
AND WHAT WE GOT WAS WE FOUND THAT IF YOU UH WHAT THEY TH WHAT PROBLEMS THEY ARE HAVING WITH DIFFERENT UH REMOTE CONTROLS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS THEY DO FIND IT THAT THE REMOTE CONTROLS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET ARE UGLY
THEY ARE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING
SO WE HAVE TO PUT STRESS ON THIS UH WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FACT ALSO LIKE OUR DESIGN
UH SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE SHOULD BE GOOD LOOKING FOR THE CONSUMERS
AND YES THAT'S WI UH THIS WILL DEFINITELY THIS CAN DEFINITELY PUT UH UH ENHANCE OUR SALES
UH AND EVEN UH THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY HIGH UH PAY MORE FOR THIS UH GOOD LOOKING REMOTE CONTROLS ALSO
SO EVEN IF THE AVAILABLE MARKET GOES FOR THE AVAILABLE UH EVEN IF THE MARKET GOES FOR THE AVAILABLE REMOTE CONTROL IS LESS EVEN THEN WE CAN SELL IT AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
WHICH MAYBE WHICH MAY SEEM QUITE HIGH BUT IF OUR LOOKS ARE ARE IF THE RE REMOTE CONTROL WE DESIGN HAVE A GOOD BETTER UH BETTER LOOK UH DESIGNS
THEN WE CAN HOPE THAT CONSUMERS WILL PREFER THESE G REMOTE CONTROLS
THEN
AND THE SECOND THING SOME SOME COMPANIES THEY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE AND MORE FUNCTIONS OF THE USERS UH OR IN THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS
BUT RATHER THAN THOSE HAVING MORE FUNCTIONS IN THE REMOTE CONTROLS WE SHOULD EMPHASISE WHAT ACTUALLY CONSUMER WANT WHAT THEY OPERATE RATHER THAN MAKING IT TOO COMPLICATED
BECAUSE MOSTLY IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS THEY USE ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
SO THERE IS NO POINT OF HAVING NINETY PERCENT BUTTONS MAKING THE REMOTE CONTROLS TOO BULKY
TOO COMPLICATED TOO EXPENSIVE A BECAUSE I THINK I BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS USEFUL ONLY IF UH THE CONSUMERS THEY WANT TO USE IT
OTHERWISE THERE IS NO POINT OF HAVING ALL THIS TYPE OF THINGS
SO THIS WILL NOT ONLY REDUCE THE COST OF OUR REMOTE CONTROLS BUT IT WILL INCREASE OUR PROFIT ALSO
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FACT ALSO
THEN
UH IT WAS FUNCTION I WANT TO GO TO
UH ESCAPE OKAY THANK YOU
THEN IF WE LOOK AT THIS SLIDE UH THESE ARE IN YOUR SHARED DOCUMENTS YOU CAN SEE LIKE
UH SORRY
AH T LOOK ALL THE MARKET POTENTIAL WHAT UH HOW WE SHOULD DESIGN CONSU OUR REMOTE CONTROLS
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE THERE SO AS TO EN ENHANCE OUR PROFIT ENHANCE OUR SALES
YEAH THESE ARE DIFFERENT AGE GROUP PERSONS LIKE UH SORRY I CAN OPEN IT IN ANOTHER WAY
UH YES
IF WE LOOK AT THE COSTS WHETHER THE CONSUMERS THEY ARE WILLING TO UH PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL OR NOT
WE CAN FIND THAT THEY UP TO A THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGE GROUP WE HAVE A VERY GOOD DISLIKING FOR THIS UH THIS UH POINT
LIKE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE CAN EMPHASISE ON THIS POINT ALSO LIKE
BECAUSE IT WILL DEFINITELY ENHANCE OUR SALES IN THIS AG IN THIS PARTICULAR AGE GROUP FROM UH FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE
AND I UH AND I THINK THAT MOST OF THE USERS OF THE REM UH T. V. ARE BELONG TO THIS AGE GROUP
SO WE SHOULD LOOK
YEAH
WE CAN LOOK AT THAT THAT FACTOR ALSO SO YES
YEAH
SO AND
AND THEN
YES
I THINK SO
UH IF WE LOOK AT THIS DATA HOW HOW UH H HOW WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS THE CONSUMERS ARE FACING WITH THE EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE MARKET
THEY FIND THAT THIRT UH THIRTY FIVE PERCENT UH THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE CONSUMERS THEY FIND TOO DIFFICULT TO OPERATE A REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT SHOULD BE IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO LEARN HOW TO OPERATE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS AND WE SHOULD PROVIDE PL UH SPE UH PROPER MANUALS FOR ITS USE ALSO SO AS THAT PEOPLE CONSUMERS COULD EASILY LEARN
THEY NEED NOT TO HAVE ANY MUCH TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE TO SEE UH TO KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS
SO THIS IS ALSO A VERY GOO UH MAJOR FACTOR TO LOO UH TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TO ENHANCE OUR PROFITS AND SALES
SO UM THIS IS ALL ABOUT
UH MARKET POTENTIAL BY ME
UH YES TH THANK YOU
YEAH WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT OUT
SORRY
SORRY
UH SORRY I HAVE
BRIAN THIS ONE ALSO I
YEAH
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRIAN
IF YOU WANT ME TO HELP YEAH
YEAH
UH F. EIGHT
FUNCTION F. EIGHT
MM S
IT'S NOT COMING
FUNCTION F. EIGHT OKAY
YEAH
COMPUTER
COMPUTER ADJUSTING YEAH
YEAH
ESCAPE
YEAH
YEAH
EXACTLY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
FIFTY MILLION WAS UH PROF
AS A PROFIT
YEAH ME TOO
YEAH
ABOUT COST
OKAY
UH
I
UH MAY I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
UH ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY VERY IMPORTANT POINT UH AS IF WE LOOK AT THE MARKET BECAUSE PEOPLE MOR FIFTY PERCENT PEOPLE THEY FIND THAT THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE REMOTE
IN THE ROOM
BUT YEAH ARE LOST AND MEANS THEY FORGET WHERE THEY HAVE KEPT THE REMOTE CONTROL LAST TIME
BUT IF WE ADD SPEECH RECOGNITION AS WELL AS GLOW IN THE DARK THEN BOTH THESE FACTORS WILL HELP THEIR LOCATING THE REMOTE CONTROL
LIKE IF THEY COME AND SPEAK SOMETHING AT THE REMOTE CONTROL UH REPLIES TO SOMETHING SOMETHING AND IT GLOWS IN THE DARK
BOTH THESE FACTORS UH BOTH THESE POINTS WILL HELP THEM TO LOCATE THE WHERE THEY HAVE KEPT THIS REMOTE CONTROL
AND THIS WILL DEFINITELY ENHANCE OUR UH MARKET SALES SO WE SHOULD TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION ALSO
YEAH
TOTALLY IT TAKES CHEAP SPEECH RECOGNITION SHE THEY WI
YEAH
GLOW IN DARK
HERE
SURE
UH IT IS IN SHARED DOCUMENTS
PROJOCT UH PROJECTOR
HMM
IT IS NOT GIVING ANYTHING
SHARED DOCUMENTS
UM BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE LIKE
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN ALSO IF THEY MEANS IF CHILDREN CATCH HOLD OF YOUR OR IF THEY CHEW IT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARMFUL
SO WHATEVER MATERIAL WE USE IT SHOULD BE YEAH
SO WE HAVE TO SAFETY POINT OF VIEW ALSO WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE
YEAH
SMALL LOGO WITH THE LIKE A SMALL YELLOW STRIP OR Y YELLOW WITH THE LOGO IN IT
YEAH
HMM
THAT'S GOOD
CHECK HERE
UM MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING WHICH WERE ESSENTIALLY THAT WE UH HAD DECIDED ON ROLES FOR EACH OF YOU
HOWEVER UM THERE ARE SOME CHANGES THAT I'VE GOT FROM ON HIGH THAT UM
ARE A BIT UH WELL W WHAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY REALISE IT WAS THAT THE UH THIS IS FOR A SPECIFIC TELEVISION
SO THE ALL IN ONE IDEA GOES OUT THE WINDOW
AND THEY REQUIRE THAT THE UH ACTUALLY I'LL GET TO THAT AT THE END POINT NUMBER FOUR
UM WE'LL GET WHAT YOU'VE GOT AND THEN WE CAN SEE WHAT WE CAN ADAPT FROM IT
SO UM PRESENTATIONS WERE YOU ANYBODY GOT RARING TO GO
RARING TO GO
OKAY
GOOD STUFF
MM
OH I NEED TO PLUG YOU IN
JUST ABOUT
UH THERE WE GO JUST SCREW 'EM ON IN

OKAY
YEAH IT'S LIKE A YEAH
IT'S
RIGHT
AND ALSO THE COMPANY WANT TO KEEP IT STUCK TO THE T. V. FOR UH TO KEEP DOWN THE PRODUCTION TIME
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
THAT'S COOL
UM DO YOU HAVE TROUBLE WHISTLING
REALLY
OOH
YEAH I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE
WELL I SUPPO UH YOU COULD Y YOU COULD HAVE THE YOU COULD HAVE THE BASICALLY UM INSTEAD OF A WHISTLE IF IT'S GOT THE VOICE RECOGNITION YOU COULD HAVE IT JUST
YOU KNOW WHERE ARE YOU
HMM
SOUNDS GOOD
FUNCTION F. EIGHT FOR THE UM THE UH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
LET'S REMEMBER THAT
MM-HMM
BUT SURE SURELY THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE UM SORT OF SPECIFIC RATHER THAN ABOVE A THRESHOLD 'CAUSE IF YOU HAD A LOUD MOVIE ON YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET IT BEEPING BACK AT YOU
SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO DERAIL YOU THERE
AH IS THAT WHAT THAT IS
WELL THAT'S COOL
IF YOU IF YOU CAN BUILD SPACE CRAFT YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH A REMOTE CONTROL YEAH
RIGHT OKAY
IS THAT JUST SWITCHES ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND IT'S ENTIRELY SPEECH OPERATED IS IT
YEAH
YEAH
AH NOW IT'S FIF FIFTY MILLION EUROS WE'VE GOTTA UH WE'VE G GOTTA MAKE PROFIT SO WE'RE MAKING THAT AT TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS A TIME
OKAY
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE RECHARGEABLE IDEA
IS THAT IS THAT GONNA MARK UP A LOT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I MEAN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THESE BASE STATIONS NOW IT'S ESSENTIALLY JUST A A LEAD WITH A SORT OF SELF CONNECTING BRAKE IN IT
SO I DON'T THINK IT'D UP UP THE PRICE THAT MUCH
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH
'KAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH UM I'LL TAKE THAT BACK
RIGHT ALSO SO UM A NOTICE I GOT NOT VERY LONG BEFORE THE MEETING SO DIDN'T MANAGE TO FORWARD IT ON TO YOU
IT IS LET'S SEE I'LL FIND IT MYSELF UM
TA NAH
WE HAD THAT UM TO DIS INCLUDE TELETEXT UM BECAUSE IT'S BECOME OUTDATED AND EVERYBODY USES THE INTERNET ANYWAY
UM DUNNO WHAT ORACLE WOULD HAVE TO SAY WITH THAT BUT NEVER MIND
UM IT'S ONLY FOR THE TELEVISION WHICH I'M PRESUMING MEANS IT'S FOR A SPECIFIC TELEVISION
AND UM INSTEAD OF COLOURS AND SORTA COLOUR OPTIONS THEY WANT CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN SOMEHOW IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN
YELLOW
I PRESUME
UM EVERYTHING ALL THEIR SORT OF UH YOU KNOW THE UH CORPORATE WEBSITE AND EVERYTHING'S YELLOW
AND THE LOGO UH THE SORT OF SLOGAN WE PUT THE FA FASHION IN ELECTRONICS UH
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW SORT OF INCORPOR I MEAN
I GUESS IF YOU'RE GOING FOR A SORT OF GLOBULAR SHAPE YOU COULD KIND OF HAVE IT WORKING ITS WAY ROUND IT OR SOMETHING
UH WHERE AM I
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHICH FUNCTIONS WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE
UH NOW WE HAD AS LISTED OPTIONS WE HAD
SPEECH RECOGNITION POTENTIALLY FLAT SCREEN INTERFACE L. C. D. INTERFACE UM
WE ALSO WANT TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS SO WE'LL PRETTY MUCH TAKE THAT ONE AS READ
WE'LL USE THE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS FOR A TELEVISION
NO TELETEXT
UM OKAY HOLD ON
NOT ENOUGH BUTTONS YOU MEAN
SO SORTA STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN A A FEW AND A OR IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE JUST CUTTING ON THE UM
I DO HOWEVER HAVE THIS FROM OVER MY HEAD THAT THEY DON'T WANT TELETEXT ON IT
UH MAYBE RAJ YOU COULD FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK ABOUT THAT OR MAYBE THEY'LL SEND
SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ABOUT UM WHAT PEOPLE WHETHER PEOPLE WOULD REQUIRE UM TELETEXT IN A REMOTE TELETEXT OPTION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY UM
SO UH I TAKE IT YOUR POSITION ARLO IS THAT THE BELLS AND WHISTLES WE'VE GOTTA COME UP WITH THE A GIMMICK BUT NOT TOO COMPLICATED A GIMMICK
UM SO I MEAN A A THE SORT OF INKLING I'M GETTING FROM LITTLE BITS OF UM WEB CHATTER THAT I'M GETTING SENT IS THAT THEY'RE QUITE INTERESTED IN A T. F. T. DISPLAY
INTERACTIVE DISPLAY
HOWEVER THAT DOES SOUND A BIT LIKE THE
MORE COMPLICATED DESIGN THAT RAV UH SORRY RAJ UM
SAID PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE
ALTHOUGH I GUESS IF THERE'S A SORT OF IF YOU THINK ABOUT STANDARD INTERFACES THAT PEOPLE USE ALREADY
SORT OF WINDOWS STYLE DROP DOWN MENUS OR WHATEVER I THINK MAYBE THAT'S A BIT
GOING A BIT FAR BUT YOU KNOW LIKE IN A BASIC SENSE THAT YOU COULD HAVE YOUR BASIC SELECTION OF BUTTONS
AND IF YOU HIT A SORT OF MENU AT THE TOP YOU HAVE
UM IT GOES TO A DIFFERENT SELECTION OF BUTTONS SO IT SORTA KEEPS IT SIMPLE
UM GLOW IN THE DARK IS THAT SORT OF WITH A LIGHT INSIDE IT OR IS IT SORT OF GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL
OKAY
SO
YEAH
YEAH
LOST YEAH
THAT'S COOL
THAT'S COOL
OKAY COOL
UM
SPEECH RECOGNITION I TAKE IT
I DON'T I'VE I KNOW OF NO PRODUCTS UM THAT USE SPEECH RECOGNITION WELL
REALLY
MM-HMM
YEAH OR A YEAH AN ADVERT AN ADVERT FOR B. B. C. TWO ON B. B. C. ONE'LL SWITCH THE CHANNEL FOR YOU KINDA THING
MM
UH-HUH
AH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
SO LIKE A KIND OF BACKWARDS REMOTE FROM THE TELLY
RIGHT
THAT WE SHOULD JUST STICK ON YEAH
YEAH
AND THAT'S A SORT OF BASIC R. F. KIND OF FREQUENCY SO IT'LL BE CHEAP
UH-HUH
YEAH
IT MIGHT DO US OUT OF A JOB
UM
OKAY
I LIKE THE WHOLE SORT OF REMOTE FEEDBACK THING
UM SO I THINK RATHER THAN AND THAT ALSO KIND OF TAKES OUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IN TERMS OF THE INTERFERENCE OF IT NOT WORKING VERY WELL AND THINGS LIKE THAT
SO I TH YEAH AND EXPENSE AND THE TIME
SO I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO GO WELL I MEAN LIKE THE THING ABOUT THE THERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE T. F. T. OR THE L. C. D. KIND OF THING IS IF YOU'RE ALSO WANTING THE THE KIND OF
UH ORGANIC GLOBBY SORT OF FEELING TO IT THEN
YOU MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE INCORPORATING THE SCREEN
UM BUT I GUESS NOT I THIN WE'LL JUST WE'LL JUST PRETEND THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
UM UH AND HOW ARE YOU ABOUT THE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL
IS THAT
CONTRAST CONTRA WELL
YEAH OKAY
SO IF IT'S DOW IT'S D UH YEAH
OR IF IT'S DOWN UNDER THE COUCH CUSHIONS UM WHICH IS WHERE I USUALLY FIND MINE
UM
OKAY WELL WE CAN USE WE CAN STILL USE THE GLOW IN THE DARK AS A GIMMICK ESSENTIALLY
UM IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE LOGO ON AS WELL BRIGHT YELLOW LOGO IN OUR OUR UM
SLOGAN
UH THEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE FAIRLY BRIGHTLY COLOURED ANYWAY
AND WE CAN HAVE SORT OF A A A TRIMMING AS WELL OF THE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL JUST AS GIMMICKYNESS
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT SO N SORTA IF IF IF WE'RE GON IF WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THE IDEA OF UM UH OF FEEDBACK
SORT OF REMOTE FINDER THEN THAT KINDA STUFFS THAT ONE OUT THEN
DO YOU THINK
UH IT MAKES IT FAIRLY UNNECESSARY THEN
OKAY
UM OKAY SO SCRATCH THAT
UH SO WE'VE GOT DO WE WANT TO GO WITH THE T. F. T. IDEA OR THE IS THAT FAR TOO EXPENSIVE
WELL I MEAN I THINK I THINK THE SORT OF FIND THE FINDER THINGS I MEAN IT'S UH I COULD PROBABLY WRITE THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM FOR THAT MYSELF
UM
MM-HMM
OKAY
UM NO I MEAN THAT WAS GOING ON RAVS UH RAJ'S SORT OF UM MARKETING RESEARCH I GUESS
UM
UH
SO WE'LL STICK WITH SORT OF PROGRAMMABILITY UM FOR THE BUTTONS THAT WE DO HAVE
UM
SO THAT'S SORT OF
INCLUDED IN YOUR SUB MODULE KIND OF STUFF UM
UH YOU WERE FINDING OUT ABOUT TELETEXT
IF YOU COULD FIND OUT THAT UH
UM I THINK WE'RE GONNA SCRATCH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AS A BIT OF A
UM EXPENSIVE NO
OH RIGHT OKAY
IS IT NOT THE CIRCUITS THAT COST
OH RIGHT OKAY
UH WELL THAT KIND OF TAKES BACK THE R. F. THE R. F. REMOTE SORT OF IDEA AS WELL
UM
FIVE MINUTES
OKAY
DECISIONS
UH VOTES LET'S VOTE
WHO WANTS T. F. T.
NO ONE DOES
EXCELLENT SO WE'LL GO WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION YEAH
UM SPEECH RECOGNITION LIMITED BUTTONS ORGANIC DESIGN
AND WHAT ELSE WAS I THINKING OF THAT I HAVEN'T WRITTEN DOWN AND THEREFORE FALLEN OUT MY HEAD PROGRAMMABILITY
UH
UH O OKAY
AND ALSO INTEGRATING THE REMEMBER TO INTEGRATE THE LOGO AND THE S SLOGAN
OKAY SO
UM CAN YOU PUT ALL THESE REPORTS IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IF THEY'RE NOT ALREADY IN THERE AS WELL
SO IT JUST HELPS ME SUMMARIZE THEM
AND UM I'LL PUT ANY I'M I'M PUTTING ANYTHING I DO IN THERE ANYWAY SO UH
UH PRO UH PROJECT DOCUMENTS
ON
A. M. I. SCENARIO CONTROLLER
WHERE AM I
PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH IT'S ON YOUR DESKTOP AS WELL
AND I WILL TR GETTING STRINGS OF UM INFORMATION I'LL TRY AND FORWARD ANY SPECIFIC TO ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR
AS SOON AS I GET THEM NOW RATHER THAN I WAS ABOUT TO SORT OF TELL YOU ABOUT THE CHANGES BEFORE THE MEETING
AND THEN THE MEETING TURNED UP SO
I DID
SO
OKAY
YEAH
MORE SORT OF UM
FLESH LIKE THAN PLASTICKY SORT OF
OH NO ETHICS THAT'S GONNA COST US MONEY
OKAY SAFETY
YEAH
IT SME SMELLS GOOD FOR CHILDREN
THAT SOUNDS YEAH IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE IT'S GONNA BE HAVE A BIG YELLOW FOAM BALL YEAH SORRY
PLEASE GOD NO
UM
WELL I WOULDN'T TH I MEAN MY REACTION TO AN ALL YELLOW REMOTE CONTROL WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN HORROR SO I THINK JUST HAVING IT
SURROUNDING THE LOGO
YEAH
AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN ARGUE WITH BOSS ABOUT PUTTING THE WHAT WAS IT
WE PUT WE PUT FASHION INTO
WHOOPS IT'S NOT WORKING
CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE FORGOTTEN IT
WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
I BET THAT'LL CATCH ON WELL
OKAY ANY LAST
WORRIES QUERIES
OKAY
S S I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
OKAY THEN LUNCHTIME YAY
OKAY THAT FELT A BIT MORE LIKE A SOMETHING WITH ORDER AND AND REASON TO IT THAN THE LAST ONE
THIS IS QUITE FUN ACTUALLY
I REALLY DON'T
YEAH YEAH
WOW YOU'VE YOUR FIRST PAGE
I WAS JUST WRITING REALLY BIG
I'VE FINISHED THE MEETING NOW
OH EVERYBODY NEEDS K QUESTIONNAIRE
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
WOW
SO SORRY I WAS JUST GONNA SAY WHAT WAS THE QUESTION FOR THIS
OR IS ARE YOU COMING ON TO THAT
OKAY
SO THESE PERCENTAGES ARE ARE WHAT
HMM
MM MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEP SURE THAT'S COOL UM
YEAH
I CAN TURN MY COMPUTER QUICKLY IF THAT'S OKAY
UM YEP
OKAY AND THEN WHAT DO I PRESS F. EIGHT
OH RIGHT
OKAY COOL
OH
YEAH
NO SIGNAL
OKAY
COOL
OKAY AND THEN HOW DO I PRESS THE THE BIG ONE TO GET IT ON TO THE BIG
F. FIVE AND I PRESS THAT AGAIN TO GET IT OFF AS WELL DO I
OKAY SO UM I'M THE INTERFACE DESIGN DESIGNER USER INTERFACE DESIGNER SORRY
UH I'M CONCERNED WITH UM W WHAT EFFECT THE APPARATUS SHOULD HAVE ON THE USER AND UM I'M I'M ALSO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OUR MOTTO
PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO OBVIOUSLY WE AS A COMPANY WE WANT TO MAKE OUR PRODUCTS TRENDY AND FASHIONABLE IT'S A BIG CONCERN OF OURS
OKAY AND HOW DO I PRESS N JUST THE NEXT BUTTON
THE ARROW
OKAY
SO UM I LOOKED AT EXISTING DESIGNS AND ALSO UM THE INFORMATION THAT RAJ GAVE US WAS VERY USEFUL ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE LIKE WHAT PEOPLE DISLIKE
UM AND WHAT PEOPLE FASHIONABLE BECAUSE WE SAID PEOPLE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FIVE WERE THE MAIN UM BUYERS OF OF OUR T. V. I THINK
SO UM WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY FIND FASHIONABLE
AND ERGONOMICS WE SAID UM I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO DO ANY OF THIS MYSELF
BUT UM MAYBE THAT COMES UP I DON'T KNOW
AND THE FINDINGS WELL
THE BASIC THAT WAS THE BASIC FUNCTION TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO
UM SO THEY NEED TO BE INCLUDED UM BUT I'VE GOT SOME PICTURES HERE OF SOME LEADING ONES
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET TO THEM DO I PRESS F. FIVE IS IT
ESCAPE
OH OKAY COOL
I HAVEN'T GOT MY GLASSES ON SO I HOPE IT'S THIS ONE
THESE ARE TWO LEADING UM REMOTE CONTROLS AT THE MOMENT
YOU KNOW THEY'RE GREY THEY'VE I MEAN THIS ONE'S GOT LOADS OF BUTTONS
IT'S HARD TO TELL FROM HERE WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO AND THEY DON'T LOOK VERY EXCITING AT ALL
UM PERSONALLY I PREFER THIS ONE JUST BECAUSE IT'S LOOKS EASIER USE IT'S A BIT MORE SLEEK WITH MORE OF THIS SILVER STUFF
UM BUT THERE YOU GO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST AND I THINK WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
UM
HANG ON
F. FIVE OKAY SORRY
PERSONAL PREFERENCES
UM WELL I THINK WE NEED TO L I THINK THE ERGONOMICS IS QUITE UM IMPORTANT UM
UH-HUH
AND UM I THOUGHT NOT TOO EDGY AND LIKE A BOX
MORE KIND OF HAND HELD MORE UM NOT AS UH COMPUTERY AND OR ORGANIC YEAH MORE ORGANIC SHAPE I THINK
UM SIMPLE DESIGNS LIKE THE LAST ONE WE JUST SAW NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS AND AS RAJ POINTED OUT
ONLY TEN PERCENT FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
SO I THINK WHAT WE CAN MISS OUT ON THE BUTTONS WE CAN MAKE UP FOR IN DESIGN AND AND HOW NICE IT LOOKS
UM
HAND HELD AND PORTABLE I THINK IS PORTAMINT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE T. F. T. HAVE JUST UM RELEASED UM I THINK IS IT A A REMOTE CONTROL FOR PRESENTATIONS OR UH AND A BIG SEVEN INCH BIG SCREEN
ANYWAY SO UM
YEAH
NO SEVEN INCHES ISN'T THAT BIG BUT UM ANYWAY UM SO HAND HELD AND PORTABLE AND UH M I THOUGHT ABOUT OTHER FUNCTIONS FOR T. V. BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT THAT
SO MAYBE WE FORGET ABOUT THAT
IT'S FOR ONE T. V. OH RIGHT OKAY SURE
AND SO THE LAST THING I THOUGHT W WHICH I QUICKLY MENTIONED IN THE OTHER ONE WAS MAYBE A BIT OF A GIMMICK TO SET US APART FROM OTHER PEOPLE
LIKE GLOW IN THE DARK UM WHICH DOES ALREADY E EXIST BUT IT'S NOT VERY WIDELY USED I DON'T THINK
EASY FINDER WITH THE A WHISTLE FUNCTION OR SOMETHING OR RECHARGEABLE STATION BECAUSE IT'S A PAIN WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF BATTERIES
AND I THINK THAT YEP THAT'S IT
OKAY
MM-HMM
UM I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
MM-HMM YEAH OR SOME SORT OF VOICE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH SOMETHING
OH YOU NEED TO TWIDDLE THE THINGAMIBOBSY THING
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH SURE
WELL I LIKE THAT DESIGN
YEAH NOT A PROBLEM
MM-HMM
OR A LITTLE BASE STATION OR SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT COST MORE THOUGH 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY WITH BATTERIES WE DON'T NEED TO PROVIDE WELL WE PROVIDE THE FIRST BATTERIES
BUT IT'S MORE IT'S THAT'S CHEAPER TO JUST PROVIDE BATTERIES
A BATTERY IN IT KINDA
OKAY
OKAY
MM
MM THAT'S A GOOD IDEA ACTUALLY I LIKE THE PROGRAMMABLE OPTIONS
MM 'KAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
CORPORATE COLOUR
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
'KAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
ALTHOUGH THE THE DANGER WITH THAT IS IT COULD LOOK A BIT CHEAP
YEAH
WELL
MM
ON THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS KIND OF FUNCTIONS AND STUFF
MM-HMM OKAY
OKAY COOL
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UM
GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL I WAS THINKING
UM SO I I GUESS THAT WOULD BE CHEAPER THAN A LIGHT I THINK
OFTEN LOST S WAS THAT YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
'KAY
WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS MIGHT GET A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE ACTUALLY
BUT WHAT ABOUT UM SOMETHING THAT'S BUILT INTO THE T. V. UM THAT YOU CAN PRESS AND IT'LL SEND OUT A LITTLE SIGNAL YOU KNOW LIKE THE ONES THAT WE CAN'T HEAR OR SOMETHING UM THAT THAT WILL ACTIVATE THE REMOTE CONTROL STARTS TO BEEP
IF YOU FIND IF Y
YEAH
MM
YEAH THAT'S THE ONLY THING YEAH
THAT COMES WITH OUR REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT COULD ALSO BE BUILT INTO THE T. V. THOUGH WHICH MIGHT MAKE OUR REMOTE CONTROL A BIT OBSOLETE
YEAH OKAY
MM
AND THE EXPENSE
MM-HMM
MM
MAYBE NOT EVEN ALL OF IT 'CAUSE WE SAID UM COLOURS AND FASHION W WERE IMPORTANT SO MAYBE UM JUST LIKE A LITTLE L LINE THAT'S KIND OF AROUND THE OUTSIDE AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE THE REST A DIFFERENT COLOUR
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH 'CAUSE WHAT I THOUGHT MAIN
SLOGAN YEAH
RIGHT
MM-HMM
'CAUSE YEAH THAT W MORE THAN FINDING IT
THAT WAS MORE LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE WATCHING A FILM IN THE DARK YOU CAN UM STILL SEE THE REMOTE CONTROL
THAT WAS MORE OF A A GIMMICK
MM
YEAH UNNECESSARY
YEAH
MM
SO IS THAT ONE OF OUR DEFINITE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY WA THAT IT NEEDS A T. F. T. SCREEN
YEAH YOU THINK SO
OKAY
MM-HMM THAT'S COOL
UM
IF IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE S I THINK IT'S A GOOD GIMMICK
MM-HMM
AND WHERE IS IT SORRY
OH
OKAY COOL
OKAY
OKAY
WHAT I THOUGHT AS WELL ABOUT THE MATERIAL IS UM MAYBE NOT THIS KIND OF MATERIAL
BUT MAYBE MORE LIKE UM THIS KIND OF RUBBERY MATERIAL IT'S A BIT MORE BOUNCY LIKE YOU SAID THEY GET CHUCKED AROUND A LOT
UM A BIT MORE DURABLE AND THAT CAN ALSO BE ERGONOMIC AND IT KIND OF FEELS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS
THE RUBBER RATHER THAN
MM-HMM MM-HMM
OH I THINK WI WITH THE MORE ORGANIC SHAPE OF IT IT WON'T BE AS IT WON'T AS HAVE MANY SHARP CORNERS AS THAT
SO THAT'S SOMETHING GOOD UM
I DUNNO I MEAN
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
INTERESTING
YEAH D WITH THE COLOUR UM DOES IT HAVE TO BE ALL YELLOW DO YOU KNOW
NO
YEAH
HAVING A LITTLE BIT
OKAY COOL
MM MM
MM-HMM OKAY
COOL
OH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD ONE THAT
YEAH SO
WOW
HAS ANYBO OH
HAS ANYBODY PRESSED OKAY IT VIBRATES
IT'S PRETTY COOL
YEAH GOT SMALL WRITING
I DON'T WANNA WASTE IT
NO
WE SHOULD MAKE A BIG SPONGE LEMON AND THEN IT'D BE IT WOULD BE YELLOW
IT'S YEAH
MM
NO IT'S GOT IT'S GOT IT
WOW
UH IT LOOKS THREATENING
IT LOOKS LIKE YEAH
WOW
THEN D BLIND DON'T WATCH T. V.
THEY DO
THE L. C. D. AND THE OTHER STUFF UH I THINK
BEN BANA
HMM
BUT UH PRICE PRICE NOT WITHSTANDING UM IS IT TOO COMPLICATED IS IT GONNA BE TOO MUCH JUST OVERLOAD
BUT BUT THE THING IS WHEN YOU USE A REMOTE CONTROL YOU NEVER LOOK AT IT RIGHT
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE T. V. AND AND IT'S UH IT JUST SEEMS KIND OF LIKE A A NEEDLESS TH
SO WHICH VEGETABLE
OKAY
THE THE LEMON
WELL WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS
OH
OKAY
UM SO
I GUESS THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM AMONG
AND I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU THE UH I GUESS TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THOSE
AND I'M GONNA USE THE WHITEBOARD JUST 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T USED IT
RIGHT
SO THE WAY I'M GONNA DO THIS IS UH WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OLD REMOTE CONTROLS SEE HOW THEY WORK
UH REUSE THE THE VITAL KIND OF UM ESSENTIAL PIECES OF IT AND THEN WE'LL THROW IN OUR NEW INNOVATIONS UM AND KEEP IT ALL WITHIN BUDGET
SO UH YEAH LOOKING INSIDE A A VERY SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL
UM THIS IS WHAT THEY SENT ME
'KAY
HERE'S UH THE COMPETITION I SUPPOSE
UM YOU OPEN IT UP THERE'S A CIRCUIT BOARD INSIDE UM AND THERE'S A A CHIP
A PROCESSOR THE T. A. ONE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE WHICH UM RECEIVES INPUT FROM THE BUTTONS AND CH
RIGHT IT'S VERY THEY'RE VERY CHEAP REMOTE
THIS REMOTE COSTS NOTHING YOU KNOW
UM SO THAT TAKES A SIGNALS FROM THE BUTTONS AND TRANSLATES IT INTO A SEQUENCE OF PULSES THAT IT THEN SENDS TO THE TO THE AMPLIFIER
WHICH IS MADE OF SOME TRANSISTORS AND AMPLIFIERS
OP AMPS AND THEN THAT GETS SENT TO THE UH TO THE L. E. D. LIGHT
WHICH I CAN KINDA SEE IS THAT LITTLE RED LIGHT BULB AT THE END AND THAT SENDS OUT THE INFRARED UH LIGHT SIGNAL TO THE TELEVISION
OH HERE IT IS
UM SO THIS IS KIND OF THE THE BEAR ESSENTIALS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT IT DEFINES THE UH
R UM NO I MEAN THIS IS A VERY OLD ONE SO NOW WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THIS IS A A MINIMALLY SMALL AND CHEAP THING TO MAKE
RIGHT
SO THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE FOR CERTAIN
UM
SO YOU KNOW AS WE SAID WE GOT THE OUTER CASING WHICH WE HAVE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT'S IT GONNA BE
UM THE BOARD WE HAVE TO USE BASICALLY UH THE SAME SET UP
PROCESSOR UM WE'LL PROBABLY USE THE MORE ADVANCED PROCESSOR THAN THEY HAD AMPLIFIER AND TRANSMITTER ARE ALL STANDARD
UM SO FOR THE CASING UH THIS AN E MAIL I GOT FROM OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM
UH YOU KNOW WE HAVE A BUNCH OF OPTIONS FROM WOOD TITANIUM RUBBER PLASTIC WHATNOT
UM LATEX DOUBLE CURVED CURVED
SO LOTS OF CHOICES WHAT DO WE THINK
UH OR SPONGE I GUESS ISN'T ON THERE RIGHT
ORGANIC SPONGE
UH YEAH IT'S VERY ELASTICY FOR SURE
UM
YEAH SO
OKAY SO HERE ARE A A PLASTIC
UH LATEX
OH RIGHT
SO SOMETHING WITH GIVE TO IT
OKAY
AND
AND THE COLOUR IS YELLOW RIGHT
YELLOW OKAY
UM
MM' KAY
SO YELLOW FOR THE BODY AND THEN WHAT COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS
SO MULTI COLOURED BUTTONS
OKAY
OKAY
MM 'KAY SO THE SHAPE WE WANNA GO
UM HOW EXACTLY
MAYBE
DOUBLE
WHAT ABOUT A BANANA
YEAH
OKAY LIKE WE COULD HAVE A BIG BANANA SHAPED REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT'S YELLOW FRUIT RIGHT
OH I IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH END YOU POINT I GUESS
WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE L. E. D. S ON EACH END
SO A SPONGY BANANA RE YEAH
OKAY OKAY
SEE
SO MAYBE AN AN UNIDENTIFIABLE FRUIT OR FIABLE FRUIT OR VEGETABLE LIKE SO IT WOULD HAVE A STEM PERHAPS AND A
MAYBE A IT'D BE S AXIALLY SYMMETRIC
SO IT'D LOOK LIKE THIS KINDA
LIKE A GOURD ALMOST OR A SQUASH OF SOME SORT
YEAH AND IT HAS A A CLEAR TOP AND BOTTOM SO Y SO YOU COULD SAY YOU KNOW IT TRANSMITS FROM THIS END
YEAH
OKAY SO DOUBLE CURVED SINGLE CURVED WHAT DO WE FEEL
OKAY
OKAY UM I GUESS SINCE YOU'RE THE MARKETING GUY
WE'LL UH
OKAY WE COULD DO THAT
UM
OKAY SO
SO BUTTONS
OKAY JUST LIKE THAT
OKAY
WITH THE SCROLL WHEEL OR NO
OKAY UH I COULD PUT THE MICROPHONE HERE
OKAY THERE'S THE MICROPHONE
WHERE SHOULD I PUT THE MICROPHONE
OKAY WELL WE CAN DO SOME USER TEST WITH SCROLL WHEELS RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
SO SHOULD THE MICROPHONE BE JUST ANYWHERE ON IT OR
'KAY THERE'S THE MIC
UM N WELL WE CAN
WHOOPS
UM
YEAH
UM
OOPS SORRY
OKAY
RIGHT
HMM
THEY CAN WORK FROM A YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD IT
YEAH
I IT COULD EVEN ENCOURAGE HEALTHIER HABITS FOR TELEVISION WATCHERS YOU KNOW THEY HAVE UH FRUITS ALL ROUND THEM
NOW JUST MAKE SURE THEY DON'T EAT THE REMOTE
YEAH
OKAY
BUT YEAH
BUT YEAH ABOUT THE SPEECH THING IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HAND HELD OR CLOSE
IT CAN SIT AT A DISTANCE AND PICK IT UP STILL
YEAH YEAH
OKAY UM SO
YEAH S I GUESS WE DECIDED ON MATERIAL RIGHT
SO THAT THAT SPONGY LATEX RUBBER EVERYTHING FEEL
AND THE COLOURS WE GOT DOWN AND THE SHAPE MAYBE WE'LL JUST MAKE IT KINDA MIX AND MATCH TYPE OF SHAPE OR
YEAH
OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
GREAT
UM AS FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE UM YOU KNOW ALMOST EVERY REMOTE CONTROL USES JUST BATTERIES BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE LIMITED BY THAT
WE CAN USE A HAND DYNAMO
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS WE CRANK IT
RIGHT IT'S LIKE THOSE WATCHES THAT YOU C SO
THIS MIGHT BE AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANNA GRAB YOU CAN SHAKE IT IF IT'S OUT OF POWER
OKAY
SO IF IT IF IT'S NOT WORKING I GUESS PEOPLE'S NATURAL REACTION ANYWAY IS TO JUST SHAKE THE THING
RIGHT
OKAY
UH THERE'S SOLAR POWER
UM
YEAH
OKAY SO PROBABLY JUST
MM
'KAY
OKAY
SO UH A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY
OKAY
UM THE USER INTERFACE THE BUTTONS I GUESS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ALREADY
UM
HMM
UH TH THE UH THE ELECTRONICS UM BASICALLY THE MORE FEATURES WE ADD UM
OOPS THIS ONE
SO THE MORE FEATURES WE ADD THE FANCIER CHIPS WE NEED TO BUY AND PUT IN WHICH ADDS TO THE COST AS YOU CAN EXPECT
UM
BUT UH I THINK WE CAN KEEP IT ALL UNDER BUDGET
SO UH YES SO THE SPEECH THING YOU SAID OUR OUR TECHNO OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT CAME UP WITH SOME BREAK THROUGH
SO JUST IN TIME
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH AND KEEPING THE L. C. D. SCREEN OUT
HUH
OH YEAH THAT WAS THAT WAS IT
SO CONTROL F. EIGHT RIGHT
TRY UH FLIPPING THE SCREEN DOWN
'KAY
OH I GET TO DO IT TOO
OH NEAT
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
SAVE EVERYTHING TO THE SHARED DOCUMENTS IS THAT RIGHT
OH
UH THESE LAPEL MICS ARE TROUBLE
ARE WE DONE WITH OUR MEETING
YEAH
YEAH
HI ME RAJ AGAIN
UH IN THIS MEETING I I'M GOING TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE TREND WATCHING UH HOW THESE TRENDS IS GOING TO AFFECT OUR MARKET POTENTIAL AND HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK ON THIS
FIRST OF ALL METHODOLOGY
THE MET METHODOLOGY TO FIND OUT THE TREND WAS INCL UH WAS DONE IN A WAY WE HAVE DONE A REC NOT ONLY A RECENT REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SURVEY
BUT WE ALSO CONSIDERED THE LATEST FRE FASHION TRENDS OF THE MARKET BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THIS IS ALSO A FACTOR WHICH WILL AFFECT OUR SALES AND PROFIT
SO WHAT ARE OUR FINDINGS
IN OUR UH IN OUR FINDINGS WE HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN WE DID OUR REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SURVEY WE FOUND THAT UH PEOPLE L UH PEOPLE DO HAVE PREFERENCE FOR THO FANCY MOBI UH F REMOTE CONTROLS WHICH LOOK AND FEEL VERY GOOD
RATHER THAN HAVING A FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL UH GOOD
SO THIS SH THIS CLEARLY INDICATES THEIR PREFERENCE FOR THE DESIGN THEIR OUTLOOK OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS
SO WE SHOULD TAKE INTO UH WE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS FACTOR AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR BECAUSE THIS FACTOR IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT
THE SECOND FACTOR WHICH IS FURTHER TI TWICE THE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SEC AS UH THE THIRD FACTOR
SO THIS FACTOR BECOMES THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OUR SURV UH UH IN OUR MARK UH MEANS IN TAKE IN DESIGNING OUR REM UH REMOTE CONTROLS
NO THE FIRST ONE IS THE UH THE OUTLOOK OF THE MOBILE THE IT SHOULD HAVE A FANCY OUTLOOK
THE FANCY DESIGN UH RATHER THAN JUST HAVING A FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL GOOD IT SHOULD HAVE A FANCY LOOK AND FOO FEEL GOOD
THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE A TECHNOLOGICALLY UH INNOVATIVE
WE MUST HAVE SOME TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL THA RATHER THAN JUST PUTTING IT AS IT IS AS THE OTHER REMO UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE
SO IT UH SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE LIKE GLOW IN THE DARK OR SPEECH RECOGNITION SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO THAT INDICATES OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT
AND THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IN THE TA TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
LIKE IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH CO COMPLICATED THERE SHOULDN'T BE TOO MANY BUTTONS ON THIS MOBI UH REMOTE CONTROL
IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO COMPLICATED UH LIKE THIS WAY
AND IT SHOULD BE UH AND CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH MANUALS THAT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND IN THEIR LOCAL LANGUAGE SOMETHING
SO THAT THEY COULD KNOW HOW TO USE THESE REMOTE CONTROLS
WHEN WE DID UH F FASHIONS UH RECENT FASHION UH OUR RECENT FASHION UPDATE SHOWS THAT
AH YEAH
Y YEAH UH YEAH WE HAVE TO BECAUSE UH D YOU CAN SEE HOW PEOPLE HAVE RELATED THEIR CLOTHES SHOES AND EVERYTHING WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
BECAUSE THE G WORLD IS NOW CHANGING IT'S TREND TOWARDS ORGANIC BECOMING MORE AND MORE ORGANIC BECOMING YEAH
SO YEAH
SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE WE SHOULD DO
AND PEOPLE UH THE F FEEL OF THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY RATHER THAN JUST HAVING A PLASTIC LOOK HARD LOOK
YEAH
YEAH
SO SO THAT THEY COULD PLAY WITH IT WHILE HANDI UH WHILE HANDLING IT
SO THAT SHOULD ALSO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
SO THESE ARE MY VIEWS
SO
NO IT CA Y A THE RUBBER WHICH IS GOOD FOR HEALTH AND WHICH IS QUITE DISPOSABLE THAT WE CAN TAKE INTO CO YEAH
'CAUSE WE IT SHOULDN'T BE HAVE ANY HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT ALSO BECAUSE OUR COMPANY IS VERY WELL FOR TAKING ALL THESE CONCERNS INTO CONSIDERATION
SO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY HARM TO THE SOCIETY SO
SO THAT'S ALL
S UH WE DIDN'T FIND OUT ANY SUCH POINT
UH YES THERE COULD BE BUT WE COULDN'T FIND OUT ANY SO
YEAH
OH NO
YEAH UH YEAH UH YEAH
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
HMM
BUT IN OUR MARKET SURVEY WE HAVE SEEN THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE
BUT THEY WANT THE QUALITY THEY WANT F FANCY LOOK THEY WANT SOME NEW DESIGN SOMETHING NEW
UH YEAH
YEAH
SO EVEN IF WE INCREASE OUR COST LITTLE BIT WITHIN UH SOME LIMITS AND WE GIVE SOMETHING NEW TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT AS WELL AS NEW DESIGN WITH FANCY OUTLOOK
I THINK WE WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A GOOD SALES IN THE MARKET
AND THE
UH I IT WILL BE EASY BECAUSE THERE WILL BE ON L. C. D. S SCREEN
THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT FRENT ICONS THEY CAN JUST CLICK OK OKAY WHATEVER THEY WA
AH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH I APPRECIATE THIS IDEA BECAUSE THEN THIS THIS WILL HELP US IN OUR ADVERTISEMENT ALSO AND WE CAN RELATE WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THE PEOPLE'S CHOICES
THAT WHAT OUR DATA SHOWS THAT SO THIS W THIS W
UH THE FASHION TREND SHOWS THAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES LIKE PEOPLE UH NOW
SPONGY
YEAH THEN ONLY WE CAN RELATE IT WITH SOMETHING
YEAH
EXACTLY
OR WE CAN DO SOMETHING WE CAN DESIGN TWO THREE SHAPES AND WE CAN HAVE A PUBLIC SURVEY LET THE PUBLIC CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT
YEAH SURE
I WILL BE HAPPY TO DO THAT
YEAH
OR WE CAN WE CAN DO ONE THING WE CAN JUST HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL AND CASINGS OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SHAPES
DIFFERENT FRUIT SHAPES IN SUCH A WAY THAT A ANY CASING CAN BE COULD BE FIT INTO THIS MOBILE GENERAL PIECE
SO WHATEVER PEOPLE WANT LIKE IF SOMEBODY WANT IT IN BANANA SHAPE
WE WILL PUT THAT CASING ONTO THAT MOBILE PHONE OKAY IT WILL LOOK L UH YEAH
IN THAT W
S S SORRY
UH LIKE IF THIS IS A LIKE IF THIS IS A MOBILE PHONE UH WE WILL DESIGN CASING IN SUCH A WAY LIKE HALF OF
WE NEED NOT TO HAVE A FULL COVER WE WILL JUST HAVE A HALF OF COVER OKAY
IF SOMEBODY WANTS IT I IN BANANA SHAPE WE WILL FIT BANANA SHAPE CASING ONTO THAT SO IT WILL GIVE A BANANA SHAPE LOOK
IF SOMEBODY WANTED IN APPLE SHAPE WE WILL DESIGN THAT WE WILL PUT WE WILL PUT APPLE SHAPE CASING ON THAT
IT WILL GIVE APPLE SHAPE LOOK
SO IN THAT WAY YOU CAN HAVE ANY THAT MEANS WHATEVER YOU WANT WITHOUT UH YEAH
YEAH BUTTON WILL BE ON THE UPPER SIDE BUTTONS WILL BE THE ON THE UPPER SIDE
YEAH BUTTONS WILL BE ON THE UPPER SIDE LOWER SIDE WE WILL JUST PUT THE CASING
SO HALF OF THAT WILL BE LOOK THE YEAH NOT NOT THE UPPER SIDE

I CAN'T SEE THA ALTHOUGH TH I MEAN TO BE TO BE SURE THEY HAVE GOT I MEAN THEY ARE GOING CRAZY WITH THE L. C. D. TECHNOLOGY NOW
SO THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR L. C. D. T. V. S AND EVERYTHING SO MAYBE THE SMALL
BUT I MEAN LIKE I I THE BLACK AND WHITE I GUESS IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK FUNKY ENOUGH

MM-HMM
I LIKE I LIKE THE COLOURFUL BUTTONS AS WELL
YEAH
I MEAN WE ARE MARKETING TO SORT OF TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE SO MOST PEOPLE
WILL HAVE COME IN CONTACT WITH THAT KIND OF USE
YEAH
AND THAT MEANS THA THAT MEANS YOU GET TO BUMP THAT BIT TO THE T. V. MAKER SO
'KAY

MAGIC MAN
MM-HMM
SO THIS IS A STANDARD OFF THE SHELF KIND OF A CHIP IS IT
RIGHT
OKAY
SO CAN WE MAKE THEM TO PRETTY MUCH ANY SIZE WE LIKE OR IS THERE A MINIMUM OR
THEY GOTTA BE
ALMOST A KEY RING
OKAY
'KAY
WELL
WELL I MEAN LIKE LA LATEX HAS A KINDA SPONGY FEELING TO IT DOESN'T IT
UM
YEAH
AND THAT WOULD K ALSO GIVE IT KINDA DURABILITY AND
AND THER THAT'S ALSO F SORTA RELATIVELY CHEAP TO CAST
UM SO MAYBE S UH A SORT OF UH PLASTIC INITIAL PLASTIC WITH A A LATEX KINDA SHEATH
OH RIGHT OKAY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT STUFF IS
YEAH
OR AT LEAST INCORPORATING YEAH
I MEAN I FORGOT I WE'RE SORT OF UH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER STANDARD SILVER KIND OF
OTHER PARTS OR UH
MM-HMM

YEAH
ALTHOUGH I MEAN THIS UH UH ALSO COMES TO SHAPE AS WELL
I MEAN IF WE ARE GONNA MAKE IT A NOVEL I MEAN DOUBLE CURVED SOUNDS GOOD TO ME IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SORTA ERGONOMIC AND EASY USE
A BIT COMFIER YOU KNOW
YEAH IT'S UH YEAH THAT THAT'D BE THAT'S SORT OF COMFORTABLE TO HOLD EASY TO HOLD SO YOU DON'T DROP IT
WELL YEAH I MEAN LIKE
YEAH YEAH
MM AND A LEMON MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARD TO GRIP

HUH
UM
I MEAN THAT THAT TH
DOES IT DOES SEEM A BIT UH AGAIN CHILDISH MAYBE
S
AND SPONGINESS
HUH
UH
YEAH WHY THE HELL NOT
LET'S THAT'LL MAKE US FIFTY MILLION EUROS
UM
WELL
I GUESS IT'S KIND OF DRA UH YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE IT SORT OF CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS A FRUIT JUST TO HAVE THAT KIND OF FRUITISH SHAPE
YEAH
YEAH WE CAN RELATE IT BY ADVERTISING OR
YEAH
THERE'S A GOOD MAN
THERE'S A GOOD IDEA
UM I L I SU I MEAN FOR THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS YOU KNOW UP AND DOWN UH PLAY STOP
THEY'VE GOT I MEAN THEY'VE GOT STANDARD SORT OF INTUITIVE UM
THINGS THAT ARE ALWAYS USED
THAT'S COOL
I LIKE IT
UM
UH SPEECH RECOGNITION I THINK SO WE NEED A MICROPHONE PRESUMABLY
YEAH
I MEAN HO H H WEL ARE WE SURE THAT SCROLL WHEEL DOES GIVE EASE OF USE
GLAD WE'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR REAL
YEAH
AND UH I THINK IF THIS THIS NEW SOFTWARE FOR THE SOUND RECOGNITION IS THE MICROPHONE
I WOULD PUT IT SORT OF SUB CENTRALLY SO IT'S YEAH
SO IT CAN BE SORT OF HELD AND W WE REALLY NEED REALLY GONNA NEED TO HOLD IT IF IT'S GONNA BE VOICE RECOGNITION
OOPS
UM
UPSIDAISY
I S I STILL LIKE IT
UM BUT THAT'S ME
YES OR MAYBE IT'S JUST GOING A BIT UH TOO FAR
I MEAN WE ARE PUSHING IT PROBABLY WITH FUNNY FRUIT SHAPES
UM DON'T WANNA SORT OF OVERKILL
'CAUSE I MEAN LIKE UH IF WE I MEAN HOW GOOD IS THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THING
DO WE WANT TO GO FOR BUTTONS AT ALL DO WE WANT TO JUST HAVE A DEVICE THAT MAYBE SITS AND PRETENDS IT'S A FRUIT
YEAH YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU JUST TAL I MEAN LIKE EVERYBODY'S GOT FRUIT BOWL IN FRONT OF THE TELLY
UM
YEAH
MAKE THEM MAKE THEM THINK OF FRUIT YEAH

YEAH
SO I MEAN LIKE YOU COULD ACTUALLY
YEAH GIVES YOU THE OPTIONS
SO A SELECTION OF CASINGS
IT KIND OF FI IT FITS WITH F FITS WITH MARKETING UM
LIKE LIKE MOBILES YEAH
YOU CAN STANDARDISE THOSE I MEAN
I THINK THO I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A FACIA THEN YOU'D WANT TO HAVE IT SO THAT IT DOES GO OVER THE BUTTONS
'CAUSE WHEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF THEY'RE WANTING IT 'CAUSE THEY WANT TO LOOK AT IT
IF THEY'RE USING IT AND WHAT THEY WANT TO LOOK AT IS FACING AWAY FROM THEM
IT DOESN'T REALLY
YOU KNOW 'CAUSE THAT'D BE IN THE PALM OF THEIR HAND AND THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT
UNLESS YOU HAVE SORT OF YOU GOT THE BUTTONS OPTIONS ON ONE SIDE
AND YOU GET THE FACIA ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH A MICROPHONE SO THAT YOU CAN PLACE IT FACE DOWN
AND YOU'VE GOT THE FACIA AND YOU CAN JUST TALK AT THE
MAYBE
SO YOU'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO HALF A DOZEN OPTIONS
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY SO WE STICK WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT THERE
MM 'KAY

I'M I'M WITH UH RAJ ON THAT I THINK YOU KNOW
I'VE GOT I'VE GOT NO I'VE GOT A NORTH FACING HOUSE THERE'S NOT REALLY EVER SUN COMING IN MY WINDOW
OH THAT'S TRUE
I MEAN I W I W UH THAT IDEA THAT I THOUGHT UM JUST ON THE BASIS OF LIKE RIDDING THEM OF BATTERIES AND THAT KIND OF BOTHER IS HAVING A
YEAH HAVING A RECHARGEABLE STAND SO THAT NOT ONLY IT DOUBLES AS A STAND
BUT UM FOR USING IT AS UH RECHARGING IT BUT ALSO FOR USING IT AS SOUND RECOGNITION
YEAH THAT KIND OF THING
YEAH
RECHARGEABLE
WHAT'S CHIP ON PRINT
WHAT'S
SORRY NEVER MIND
YEAH AND IF WE IF WE'RE JUST HAVING BUTTONS AND THE SPEECH THEN WE'RE GETTING OUR CHEAPEST OPTION OF
CHIPPING
THAT'S GOOD
UH WOAH
OKAY WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF UH WE'RE KIND OF UM EXCUSE M I'VE JUST DELETED THAT WHOLE THING

UH
APPLES
MM MM MM MM MM
'KAY SO WE CAME UP WITH THAT THAT'S OKAY
WHAT'S SUPPLEMENTS
SUPPLEMENTS
UH UH
SEE
I SHOULDA SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IF I KN SEE I I KNEW THAT
I SHOULDA SORT OF ENGINEERED IT SO WE K ENDED UP MAKING A DIFFI DIFFICULT SHAPE
JUST FOR CRUELTY
I WONDER IF THEY MEAN LIKE LITERALLY MAKE IT SORT OF BUTTONS AND EVERYTHING
UM
UH NO I THINK THAT'S US OUR DISCUSSION OVER UNLESS ANYBODY'S GOT QUESTIONS OR CONFUSIONS 'CAUSE I'M CONFUSED
HUH
UM UH WE'LL PROBABLY GET QUESTIONNAIRE IN A MINUTE IT'S A
THERE WE GO
WARNING FINISH MEETING NOW
I ROUNDED IT UP FAR TOO FAST
UM
WHERE ARE WE GOING
MY DOCUMENTS THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT
MY PROJECT DOCUMENTS
THERE WE GO
MM-HMM
OKAY
COOL
MM UM
NO I DON'T THINK SO
THE LAST ONE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS IT
OH SORRY
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SORRY
I WAS JUST READING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
HARD TO KNOW HOW WE ARE GOING TO INCORPORATE THAT
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
TH THAT'S VERY GOOD
GLOW IN THE DARK
OKAY
WELL THAT'S GOOD
THAT'S WHAT WE KIND OF PREDICTED ANYWAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY THE SPONGY NOT REAL SPONGY
YOU CAN DO YOU THINK LIKE RUBBER WOULD BE GOOD OR DOES IT REALLY WANT TO BE LIKE GEL KIND OF STUFF
OKAY
QUITE DISPOSABLE
OKAY
OH OKAY
UH-HUH
OKAY
COOL
MM
A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
AND WERE THERE ANY FACTORS THAT WEREN'T IMPORTANT IN THE SURVEY THAT THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT
OR WAS IT JUST OKAY
COOL
F. WHAT IS IT
UM
YEAH
OKAY
NO SIGNAL
IS THAT
OKAY AND THEN F. FIVE RIGHT
OKAY
UM
OKAY SO THE INTERFACE CONCEPT UM
YEAH
THE INTERFACE SPECIFICATION WHAT PEOPLE UM HOW THEY INTERACT WITH IT BASICALLY I THINK
UM SO THE METHOD WE LOOKED AT EXISTING DESIGNS WHAT ARE THE WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THEM
WHAT'S BAD ABOUT THEM UM I LOOKED AT THEIR FLAWS SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THEIR FLAWS EVERYTHING
UM AND WHAT THE SURVEY TOLD US AND WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE GOOD SO A BIT OF IMAGINATION
UH THE FINDINGS I'VE GOT SOME PICTURES TO SHOW YOU AS WELL
YEAH
OKAY SO MOST REMOTE CONTROLS USE GRAPHICAL INTERFACE
WHERE YOU UM HAVE GOT S BUTTONS AND YOU POINT IT RATHER THAN HAVING THE OUTPUT AS A A STREAM OF TEXT OR SOMETHING
UM AND WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE'S INCONSISTENT LAYOUT WHICH MAKES IT CONFUSING
SO I THINK FOR OUR REMOTE CONTROL THERE IS SOME INCONSISTENCY ALREADY IN EC EXISTING IN BETWEEN REMOTE CONTROLS
BUT I THINK STANDARD KIND OF UM SHAPE AND UH PLAY AND THOSE KIND OF BUT BUTTONS LIKE THE THE TOP RIGHT FOR ON AND OFF OR SOMETHING
I THINK PEOPLE FIND THAT THEN IT'S EASY TO USE
AND WE'VE GOT SOME PICTURES OF SOME UH NEW REMOTE CONTROLS TO SHOW YOU
DO I PRESS ESCAPE F. FIVE
OR JUST
ESCAPE OKAY
UM OH I STILL HAVEN'T GOT MY GLASSES ON
YEAH OKAY
SO THESE ARE THE SOME OF THE PICTURES OF EXISTING ONES
I'LL JUST WALK YOU THROUGH THEM
THIS ONE IS A VOICE RECOGNITION
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF IDEA WE'RE GOING FOR
THERE'S UM AN L. C. D. THING WHICH WE THOUGHT COULD I THOUGHT COULD GET A BIT CONFUSING AND A BIT EXPENSIVE AS WELL FOR US
THIS ONE IS GOT A KIND OF SCROLL LIKE A MOUSE WHICH YEAH
UM AND BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW YOU'D USE THAT LIKE WOULD THE COMPUTER COME
UH-HUH THAT'S LIKE THE L. C. D. ONE IS IT
BUT THE ONE BELOW THAT HAS GOT LIKE A LITTLE SCROLL FUNCTION ON THE SIDE
BUT I PRESUME THAT THE FUNCTIONS MUST COME UP ON THE T. V. SCREEN
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THAT IS
SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW IDEAS
AGAIN THAT'S JUST QUITE BORING SHAPE GREY LOOKS QUITE SPACE AGEY BUT TOO MANY BUTTONS I THINK ON THAT ONE
YEAH IT DOES LOOK KIND OF DANGEROUS
UM THIS ONE I THOUGHT WAS REALLY COOL
IT'S W IT'S GOT THE PROGRAMMABILITY FUNCTION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
YOU CAN PUT IT IN THERE IT'S FOR YOUR KIDS AND IT'S QUITE AN ORGANIC SHAPE AND THE LITTLE CIRCLE AROUND THERE IS PRETTY COOL
AND THAT'S REALLY EASY TO USE BRIGHT SO I LIKE THIS ONE LOT FOR OUR DESIGN
I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE GOOD
OF COURSE YELLOW
RIGHT YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
UM SO MAYBE THAT COULD BE BUILT INTO ONE OF THE THINGS AND IT COMES UP ON THE T. V. OR SOMETHING
AND THIS ONE THE OVER SIZED ONE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I THINK IT'S A BIT TOO GIMMICKY
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL SELL VERY WELL
I GUESS SO
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK THAT'S A BIT
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
AND UM THIS ONE IS JUST POINTING OUT
I LIKE SOME OF THESE THINGS UM THE THE RAISED SYMBOLS AND EVERYTHING
BUT POINTING OUT UM THAT THIS ONE THE VOLUME IT IS KIND OF PRESSING DOWN BUT IT WOULD ACTUALLY GO UP BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE
SO THAT COULD THAT'S A BIT CONFUSING
UM BUT THE BUTTONS ON THIS I THINK ARE IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU HOW YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT UM BUTTONS
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE ALL THE SAME
SO THAT'S QUITE COOL
UM
YEAH EXACTLY
UM F. FIVE
YES
SO THERE ARE SOME OF THE FINDINGS
SO WE NEED TO COMBINE THOSE ONES UM AND I'VE JUST GOT AN E MAIL FROM OUR TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT THEY HAVE BROKEN THROUGH WITH SOME NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THAT YOU CAN PROGRAM IN
UM YEAH IT IS JUST IN TIME VERY HANDY
UM SO I THINK MAYBE INCORPORATING THAT IN OUR DESIGN WOULD BE GOOD
IT'S YOU PROGRAM IT LIKE YOU SAY RECORD UM AND THEN PLAY AND THEN
RECORD PLAY MACHINE AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THAT'S AND IT'S MUCH YEAH
SO THAT'S QUITE COOL
UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES JUST SOME IMAGINATION THE RAISED SYMBOLS I THOUGHT WERE GOOD THE L. C. D. IT DOES LOOK SMART
BUT I THINK MAYBE FOR OUR BUDGET DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE THE
YEAH
AND THE SPEECH RECOGNITION 'CAUSE I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION ARE WE
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
BUT OUR BUDGET WE'VE YEAH
UH-HUH
OKAY
I'M NOT SURE IF THE IF FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS UH PER UH TWELVE EUROS FIFTY M MANUFACTURING COST
THE L. C. D.
YEAH
NO
YEAH
S
UH-HUH
YEAH THAT'S THE THING BECAUSE
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
AND ONE OF THE SURVEY FINDINGS WAS THAT THEY WANT IT EASY TO USE SO I THINK I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE L. C. D.
IT'S A IT'S GREAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT FOR OUR BUDGET AND FOR THE THING WE'RE TRYING TO GO FOR EAS EASY TO USE
IT'S NOT THE THING WE SHOULD GO FOR I THINK
CHILD FRIENDLY I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOOD AS YOU POINTED OUT THE UM
THE BIT IT OFTEN GOES MISSING ESPECIALLY WITH CHILDREN
BUT IT'S A GOOD SHAPE AND THE ORGANIC IS KIND OF WE COULD MAKE A VEGETABLEY KIND OF ROUND SHAPE I THINK
YEAH I KNOW CARROT
YEAH
BUT WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE YEAH
UM THE CHILD FRIENDLY YEAH
EASY TO USE IT SEEMS QUITE EASY TO USE
I LIKE THE D THE DIFFERENT SHAPES OF THE BUTTONS AND STUFF
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GO FOR
YEAH
AND THE MOUSE ONE I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE PEOPLE USE MO MICE MOUSES NOW WITH THE SCROLLING THING
UM
YEAH
S YEAH
SO THEY'D BE ABLE TO USE THAT UM AS I SAID I THINK I I'D PRESUME IT WOULD COME UP ON THE SCREEN
UM SO THERE YOU GO
YEAH
SO THAT'S UM THE USER INTERFACE
DESIGN
SO OKAY I'LL TAKE THIS OUT NOW THEN
THERE YOU GO
MM
MM-HMM
MM
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE SPONGE
YEAH
YEAH
I LIKE THE RUBBER THE STRESS BALLS I THINK YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE A BIT OF A GIMMICK LIKE IT'S GOOD TO HOLD AND
YEAH
AND THAT MIGHT BE QUITE DURABLE AND EASY TO CHUCK AROUND
YEAH Y YELLOW INCORPORATED YEAH
I THINK
MM
YEAH THE BUTTONS W LIKE
'CAUSE THERE'S GONNA BE THE THE COVER THE THE RUBBER OR THE PLASTIC CASING AND THEN THE BUTTONS IN PROBABLY TWO DIFFERENT COLOURS OR I IF WE'RE HAVING BUTTONS ACTUALLY
I DON
YEAH
YOU DO HAVE ONES LIKE UM PLAY COULD BE GREEN OR ON AND OFF IS RED AND STUFF LIKE THAT YEAH
MAKES IT EASY TO USE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE THAT BLUE ONE DID LOOK QUITE HARDISH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE UH AN HOUR GLASS KIND OF FIGURE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING OF OR JUST LIKE A
IT'S NOT YEAH
WE COULD MAKE NOVELTY REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH
BUT THEN HOW WOULD YOU POINT IT
HOW WOULD YOU POINT IT
WHAT
YEAH
Y I'M I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE BANANA IDEA
RUBBER BANANA
OKAY
YEAH
I THINK MAYBE JUST DRAW ON THE KIND OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SHAPE
AND WHAT ELSE DID YOU SAY ABOUT FASHIONS
WHAT WAS TRENDY
AND SPONGY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE YEAH
LIKE WHAT'S WHAT'S THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF IT SOME KIND OF
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S LIKE LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE SNOWMAN KIND OF THING
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THAT
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING
YEAH MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE
'CAUSE THAT YOU CAN HOLD IT IN LIKE THE BOTTOM BIT AND
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT DO YOU GUY WHAT DO YOU THINK
NO
YEAH
UH-HUH
OKAY
OKAY
AND BUTTONS WOULD DID WE SAY
UH DIFFERENT SHAPES OF BUTTONS
MM
YEAH
YEAH WHAT ABOUT THE SCROLL WHEEL AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
MM-HMM
YEAH I'M NOT SURE
UM I MEAN THOSE IDEAS I SAW WERE JUST FOR INSPIRATION I THINK
UM YEAH I CAN NO I'M NOT SURE
I COULDN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S COOL
SO LET'S NOT USE THE WHITEBOARD ANY MORE
AND UH SO WHAT ELSE WAS THERE
UM THE WHAT ABOUT THE GLOW IN THE DARK THING THE STRIP AROUND IT
ARE WE JUST GONNA LEAVE THAT
YOU STILL LIKE IT
'CAUSE WE'VE GOT THE UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM
'CAUSE UM IT COULD YEAH
ESPECIALLY WITH YELLOW
MM
I DUNNO
THEN YOU PUT IT IN THE FRUIT BOWL
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH DO WE NEED BUTTONS
MM
I QUITE LIKE THE SHAPE
I QUITE LIKE THE DESIGN OF THAT UH 'CAUSE THAT COULD SIT ON ITS OWN AND IT'S QUITE GOT A QUITE STEADY BASE
UM
AND AS WE SAY WE N WE DON'T WANNA BE TOO RIDICULOUS WITH THE FRUIT THINGS YOU KNOW
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU SAID ABOUT DISPOSABLE DIDN'T YOU
YOU SAID ABOUT DISPOSABLE EARLI PEOPLE WANT DISPOSABLE THINGS SO WE COULD DO THAT LIKE HAVE A CHOICE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
WE STILL NEED THE BUTTONS IN THE SAME PLACES THOUGHT DON'T WE
OH THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE
OH OKAY
OH HALF A FRUIT
OH OKAY OKAY
OKAY OKAY
OKAY
MM MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL UM BECAUSE WELL I I'M NOT SURE IF WE SHOULD GO SO FAR IN THE WHOLE FRUIT THING
BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE JUST TAKE THE INSPIRATION FROM THE FRUIT AND UH BECAUSE WHAT YEAH
W I THINK WH WHA WOULD WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WHO WANT IT QUITE TRENDY AS WELL THEY SAID
THEY WANTED SOMETHING THAT LOOKS FANCY AND I THINK MAYBE FRUIT COULD BE A BIT OF A TOO MUCH OF A GIMMICK BUT SOMETHING ERGONOMICALLY SHAPED AND ORGANIC
LIKE GOOD TO HOLD BASED ON FRUITS AND NATURAL THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE AL ALREADY WE'RE GOING A BIT GAUDY WITH THE YELLOW YOU KNOW
I MEAN WE COULD MAKE IT NICE PALE YELLOW
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE THAT PALE YELLOW AND THEN AN OUTSIDE BIT BRIGHT YELLOW WITH YOU SAID THE LOGAN THE SLOGAN
BECAUSE
YEAH

RIGHT RIGHT
YEP
IT WON'T STAND
JUST LET IT LIE DOWN IT WONT STAND
WHAT'S ON THE UH ON THE LEFT

SO SEVEN FOURTHS
ABOUT ONE POINT F ONE POINT EIGHT
OKAY
YEAH ROUND IT UP TO TWO
SO TRENDS
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WANT US TO WRITE THERE
HOW IT HOW CONFORMS TO THE CURRENT TRENDS
'KAY
AS FAR AS THE UH TECHNOLOGY IT ITS' GOT THE LATEST TRENDS IN SPEECH TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S MISSING THE SCREEN
AS WE SAID UM BUT IT DOES HAVE THE PUSH BUTTONS OR THE SCROLL BUTTONS
UM BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT FANCY SOLAR POWER OR THE THE VIBRATING ENERGY MECHANISM
SO I GIVE IT A A FOUR
I'D GIVE IT A KINDA MIDDLE OF THE ROAD FOR
FOR TECHNOLOGY
YEAH
WELL IT WAS YELLOW
WELL I THINK IT'S THE THE REMOTE CONTROL CONFORMS TO THE THE COMPANY STRATEGY
IS THAT THE QUESTION
UM
YEAH
I'LL GO WITH TWO
SO ONE AND A HALF
A TWO
YEP
S
OKAY
UH
HMM
E EXCUSE ME I FORGOT MY

UH IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED THAT IS MINE
YEAH
SO
YEAH
SO
SO NOW IS THE FINAL EVALUATION FINAL EVALUATION OF THE UH UH OF OUR PRODUCT
HOW WE ARE GOING TO MEANS UH AT WHAT STANDARD WHAT STANDARD WHETHER IT MEETS OUR STANDARDS OR NOT
HOW MU WHAT RATING WE WILL GIVE TO THESE PRODUCTS
SO OF COURSE THIS IS WILL BE A TEAM WORK W WE TOGETHER HAVE TO DECIDE WHA WHAT RATING WE WILL GIVE TO THIS PRODUCT AND EVERYTHING
SO WHAT METHODOLOGY I WILL TELL YOU ON WHAT BASIS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS ALL THIS
WE WILL GIVE THE RATING TO THIS PRODUCT BASED ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS WHETHER IT MEETS THE USER REQUIREMENTS OR NOT THIS PRODUCT
THEN TRENDS WHETHER IT IS AS FASHION TRENDS OR NOT
MEANS BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY STATED THAT PEOPLE DO PREFER FASHIONABLE THINGS NOWADAYS
SO THIS IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR OUR EVALUATION ALSO
THEN MARKETING STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY
AS WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT OUR COMPANY IS QUITE IN THE MARKET NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF PROVIDING QUALITY PRODUCTS
NOT ONLY IN PRO PROVIDING LATEST TECHNOLOGIES BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL S
YEAH
SO BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL SAFE PRODUCTS UH YEAH LIKE UH KEEPING UH KEEPING IN MIND ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES
SO
NOW COMES THE CRITERIA RATING WITH SEVEN POINT SCALE
I'M HAVING THIS SCALE THIS SCALE SO WE HAVE TO DO IT ON A BOARD
THE USER REQUIREM I THINK
THANK YOU
SO
SO THESE ARE THE THREE CRITE CRITERIAS FOR OUR EVALUATION OF OUR PRODUCT
FIRST OF ALL UH COMES USER REQUIREMENT
SO WE WILL SEE WHETHER THIS PRODUCT MEETS ALL USER REQUIREMENTS OR NOT
I I WILL FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR VIEWS WHAT DO YOU THINK WHETHER IT MEETS ALL USER REQUIREMENTS OR NOT
S
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WILL PERSONALLY GIVE
SEVEN
UH
UH ONE IS MEANS HIGHEST RANKING OKAY
BUT I THINK HIGHEST RANKING IS SEVEN OR ONE
OKAY RIGHT RIGHT
SO IT'S ONE FOR FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY OUR INDUSTRIAL EXPERT
UH D YOU CAN YOU CAN TELL ON ON THE LIKE I THINK SHE HAS GIVEN HER VIEWS ON THE BASIS OF DESIGN
BECAUSE SHE WAS OUR I INTERFACE EXPERT
BUT YOU CAN GIVE YOUR VIEWS BASED ON TECHNOLOGY WHETHER THE TECHNOLOGY MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CUSTOMERS OR NOT
TWO
AND WHAT ABOUT UH YOU BRIAN
YOU WILL GO FOR ONE
OKAY
UH FOR ME PERSONALLY IT IS EVERYTHING FINE IT MAY BE HAVING GOOD DESIGN
IT MAY BE UH MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CUSTOMERS LIKE TECHNOLOGY WISE PRICE WISE
BUT THERE IS ONE THING WHICH LIMITS THE CUSTOMERS LIKE WE ARE HAVING ONLY TWO THREE DESIGNS
LIKE WE ARE HAVING ONE BANANA DESIGN AND THE OTHER ONE IS ORANGE AND UH YEAH LOWER END
AND THE THIRD ONE IS WHAT YOU GE UH THAT IS NOT A F FRUIT LOOK
BUT IF A PERSON DOESN'T LIKE BANANA OR ORANGE YOU ARE LIMITING HIM
NO DON'T BUY OUR PRODUCT BECAUSE WE ARE L WE LIKE THIS ONLY
SO WE ARE SHOWING OUR PREFERENCE FOR PARTICULAR FRUITS TWO OR THREE KINDS RATHER AND YEAH
SO
UH NO UH PERSONALLY AS A MARKETING EXPERT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WHATEVER COMPANIES THEY LAUNCH THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE SHAPE OF FRUITS
THEY GIVE A RANGE OF PRODUCTS A RANGE OF SHAPES LIKE IF WE SEE
LOOK AT THE SMALLEST THING TOFFEE CHOCOLATES THEY GIVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS
SOME CHILDREN LIKE TO BUY BANANA SHAPE SOME APPLE SHAPE SOME EVEN PINEAPPLE SHAPE SOME ORANGE SHAPE
SO YOU CAN WHAT SHAPE A PERSON WILL LIKE
SO IN THIS CASE GIVING ONLY ONE OR TWO CHOICES WE ARE LIM LIMITING OUR CUSTOMERS
AND BY LIMITING THEM WE ARE LIMITING OUR SALES LIMITING OUR PROFIT ALSO
UH MAYBE
OKAY BUT I WILL I WILL PERSONALLY WON'T GIVE IT BEYOND THREE
SO WE CAN
YEAH ON AN AVERAGE WE CAN THINK THREE FOUR SEVENTHS MAYBE
THREE OR FOUR
UH NO SORRY IT SHOULD BE
NO SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY WE ARE DOING A VERY WRONG THING
YEAH YEAH WE ARE TAKING EVERYTHING AND THAT'S I HAVE TAKEN IT VERY WRONGLY
YEAH UH THREE FOUR FOUR TWO SIX SEVEN SEVEN SEV YEAH ONE PE EXACTLY
SO WE CAN SAY ONE OR TWO
BECAUSE IT IS ONE POINT EIGHT UH TWO SO WE WILL DO TWO
YEAH
SO WHERE WERE THE TRENDS
SORRY
YEAH AGAIN THE THE FASHION TRENDS THIS ALSO LIKE WHETHER IT IT WILL BE FASHIONABLE TO HAVE THESE PRODUCTS IN THE UH AS A FRUIT SHAPE OR SOMETHING
UH
OKAY
YEAH
UH
OKAY
UH PERSONALLY I WI UH I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF TRENDS THESE PRODUCTS ARE QUITE GOOD LIKE THESE PRODUCTS ARE IN FRUIT SHAPE
BECAUSE THAT WHA PEOPLE NOW OUR FASHION TREND SHOWS THAT PEOPLE LIKE EVERYTHING ALL F EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING ADVERTISED LIKE CLOTHES
SHOES AND EVERYTHING IS BEING ADVERTISED IN THE FORM OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES OR GETTING THEM OR SHOWING SOME ASSOCIATION WITH THEM
SO AND IN THIS WAY OUR PRODUCT IS GOOD
AND THE SECOND THING NOW PEOPLE DON'T WANT ANY COMPLICATED OR BULKY PRODUCTS AND OURS IS QUITE SIMPLE AND QUITE HANDY
SO THAT IS ALSO EF THAT ALSO OUR PRODUCT MEETS THE F THE FASHION UH TRENDS OF THE MARKET
AND YES
IT IS CUS SPONGY ALSO
SO THEY CAN PLAY WITH IT IT'S QUITE GOOD
SO THEN I THINK MAYBE I CAN GIVE IT TWO
SO FOUR FIVE TEN THIRTEEN THIRTEEN
SO WE CAN IS IT FINE
SO WHAT ABOUT COMPANY STRATEGY
OKAY
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU BRIAN
YEAH AND ME ALSO LIKE THIS PRODUCT ME UH ME UH ME UH THIS MEETS ALL COMPANY STRATEGY LIKE OUR PRODUCT SHOULD BE AS PER CUSTOMERS' REQUIREMENT
AS PER LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND IT SHOULD BE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFE
SO SINCE OUR PRODUCT MEETS ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS SO I WOULD ALSO PREFER TO GIVE IT RANK ONE
SO FOUR SIX SIX
HALF
SO WE CAN SAY TWO OR ONE OKAY
SO TH SEVEN SEVEN
UH OVERALL WE ARE GETTING TWO SOMETHING BUT WE CAN ROUND IT AS TWO
YEAH
SO I THINK OVERALL UH EVALUATION OF OUR PRODUCT IS QUITE GOOD
SO WE CAN LAUNCH IT
YEAH
SO YEAH
GREAT
OKAY
WE'LL STA I'LL USE THE POWERPOINT I GUESS
HOW WAS THAT WAS THAT FUN
OKAY

OH THERE ARE ISSUES OH THERE ARE ISSUES
UM MAIN PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEING FINANCE
UH LET'S JUST ENTER IN THE UM EVALUATION CRITERIA
UM UNFORTUNATELY
THE UNIT WE ARE CURRENTLY GOING TO PRODUCE MINUS THE EXTRA SCROLL BUTTONS UH IT'S GONNA COST US FOURTEEN POINT SIX EUROS
SO WE HAVE TO REA SORRY I'VE ACCIDENTALLY HIGHLIGHTED SOMEHOW UM
THERE WE GO
OH GOD WHY IS IT DOING THAT
THERE WE GO
SO BASICALLY UM IN ORDER TO SAVE OUR TWO EUROS
UM I WAS THINKING
THAT WE COULD HAVE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SHAPE BUT JUST HAVE IT FLATTENED
UM
YEAH I MEAN IT'S ALREADY GOT A KIND OF COOL SHAPE SO BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE CURVED SORT OF IN AND OUT
AND BY DOING SO OH NO HOLD ON
DOESN'T SAVE US QUITE AS MUCH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS AGAIN
OH GOOD POINT
UM
THAT'S SORT OF CURVE IN AND OUT
NO I THINK IT MEANS DOUBLE CURVED AS IN UM LIKE UH A SINGLE CURVE ON THAT BOTTOM HALF
AND THE DOUBLE CURVED WOULD BE IF IT WAS THAT SIMILAR CURVE UPWARD
OKAY I MIGHT BE WRONG THOUGH
I DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS AS A CURVE I THINK THAT'S JUST A SHAPE
A CURVATURE IS LIKE THE THIS CASE
YEAH AND WHY WHY I'VE GOT IT TWO I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T SEEM TO SELECT ANY MORE HOWEVER
RIGHT
NO
IT'S MEANT TO BE ONE YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHY I PUT TWO IN THERE
BUT UM HOLD ON TILL I FIND IT I THINK THIS SHIFT BUTTON MIGHT BE STUCK AGAIN
NO MAYBE THE SHIFT BUTTON'S STUCK IN
UM OKAY SO THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY THREE WHICH WOULD GIVE US
OH THAT'S FINE
ELEVEN UH ELEVEN EUROS SIXTY
UM
WE COU OH NOT QUITE HAVE THE SCROLL WHEEL UNFORTUNATELY
WHAT
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW THAT JUST EXTENDS IT AS WELL
I DON'T KNOW
IT ONE OF THE BUTTONS IS STICKING I DON'T KNOW

NO IT'S IT'S LIKE TRUE IS ONE END AND FALSE IS THE OTH
OH I'LL GO FOR A ONE
BASIC REQUIREMENTS BUT OF THE PRO OF THE PROJECT

VERY FUN
OH RIGHT
OKAY
MM
OKAY
SURE
WE MADE THREE FOR YOU
UM ONE'S BASED ON THE BANANA ONE'S BASED ON THE TOMATO AND THE OTHER ONE IS ST
LOOK
OH YEAH WELL YEAH WE HAD V SOME RED LEFT OVER
SO
OKAY SO THIS IS THE UM NON TO NON UH NO BUTTONS ONE OR AS MM FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE MAINLY SPEAK RECOGNITION
THE YELLOW THERE IS THE UM THE SLOGAN YEAH THAT WE NEED TO INCORPORATE IT'S VERY SIMPLE
IF YOU DO NEED BUTTONS YOU CAN FLIP IT OVER AND THERE'S SOME THERE UM BUT MAINLY IT'S SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH
YEAH AND YEAH THEY MIGHT PROJECT THINGS ONTO THE SCREEN WHICH YOU CAN DO ON THERE
MM I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT
UM AND THIS ONE IS THE ONE W MORE LIKE THE ONE W THAT WE LOOKED AT EARLIER
YEAH YOU GUYS CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THAT IF YOU WANT
YEAH SURE
UM THAT ONE IS OH NO IT'S DELICATE
THAT'S THAT'S ALREADY GOT ITS STAND THAT ONE
THAT'S IT STAND
IT DOES ALSO LIE FLAT BUT THAT'S THE THAT YELLOW STAND THERE REPRESENTS THE THE CHARGING STAND
UM THE BLACK ON THE BACK IS THE SLOGAN
UH YEAH THAT WELL WE DID THINK OF THAT
YEAH IF IT'S STANDING UP IT'S IT'S ON THERE BUT ALSO WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE COMPANY NAME ON THE FRONT
WHICH IS THE LITTLE BLACK KIND OF LINE IN THE MIDDLE
SO UM AND THAT'S THE UM TRANSMIT THE L. E. D. THING
THESE ARE THE S TWO SCROLL ONES WHICH WE THOUGHT COULD BE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND VOLUME UP AND DOWN
WE N WERE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT PUTTING THEM THERE BECAUSE UM I IT'S IT KIND OF COULD GET BASHED
YEAH
WELL IF YOU HOLD IT YOU CAN YOU ALL CAN HOLD IT IS IT DOES ACTUALLY FEEL QUITE ERGONOMIC IF YOU'VE GOT SMALL HANDS
UM OBVIOUSLY I DON'T THINK THAT'S REAL SIZED
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A BIT BIGGER
OKAY
UM THAT'S A SPEAKER AT THE TOP SO YOU CAN SPEAK INTO IT LIKE A LITTLE WALKIE TALKIE AS WELL FOR SPEAK RECOGNITION
UM AND UM THEN THE BUTTONS
YEAH KIND OF SELF EXPLANATORY JUST BUTTONS WHENEVER YOU NEED THEM
TRIED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
OH THAT'S THE CHARGING BASE PRONGS AT THE BOTTOM
WE USED THOSE
AND UM THEN THE BIG RED BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE IS THE ON AND OFF ONE
IT'S NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL PLACE BUT UM IT'S QUITE AN OBVIOUS PLACE
SO THERE WE GO AND AND UM WE HAVE THE BANANA BASED ONE TOO
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO ARE THERE ANY UM IMPROVEMENTS OR ISSUES OR
OH
OH
OOH
MM-HMM
MORE LIKE A TRADITIONAL REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
LIKE AN S. SHAPE
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
COOL
COOL
SO WE COULD EVEN ADD SOMETHING
WELL MAYBE WE COULD ADD SOMETHING BUT MAYBE IF WHAT DO YOU TH WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE MONEY SO
YEAH IF WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN THERE'S NO POINT IN SPENDING MONEY IF WE DON'T HAVE TO
BUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU THINK WE'VE MISSED OUT THERE THEN YOU KNOW FEEL FREE TO ADD IT
MAYBE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE BIGGER SO THERE MIGHT BE MORE SPACE FOR THE THE SLOGAN ON THE FRONT
BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN AN IDEAL PLACE RIGHT NOW
MM
I THINK IT WENT QUITE SMOOTHLY
W I THINK WE WERE VERY CREATIVE
OH RIGHT OKAY
MM-HMM
EXCELLENT LEADERSHIP

YEAH
OKAY SO ONE
YEP
MM YELLOW
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OKAY
IS THAT NO IS THAT NOT TRENDS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
BUT IN ELECTRONICS I THINK IT'S NOT Q ALWAYS QUITE SO UM YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE SO MANY CHOICES AS WITH CHOCOLATES
I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A T. V. MAYBE A COMPANY'LL HAVE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE FROM
A COMPANY'LL HAVE TWO OR THREE CHOICES BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT DESIGNS
WE WERE COMING UP WITH ONE PRODUCT
NO I MEAN UH OBVIOUSLY YOUR OPINION I'M JUST TRYING TO
OKAY
WHAT ARE WE DOING
ADDING THEM UP
OH
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL UM GOING ON UH THE SPECIFICATIONS THAT WE HAD THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE QUITE POPULAR
AND THAT PEOPLE LIKE SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD TO LOOK AT AND NOT MANY BUTTONS
I WOULD GIVE IT UM WELL BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO MAKE A FRUIT GOOD TO LOOK AT
THAT THAT LOOKS COOL YOU KNOW SO I WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE IT A THREE
THA THREE OR FOUR I'M NOT SURE
THREE
GO FOR THREE
THAT'S FINE
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM

A
TWO
OKAY

OKAY
OKAY SO
ONE OR TWO
ONE
OKAY JUST LEAVE IT IT'S FINE
MM
YEAH ONE
OKAY
WOO HOO
COOL
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO SH
I'M A BIT CONFUSED ABOUT UH WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN AND CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
UH I IS IT JUST UH MORE DETAIL UH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
RIGHT
HOW HOW IT WILL BE DONE
SO WHE WHERE DO WE IDENTIFY THE COMPONENTS OF OUR UH PRODUCT
UH I THINK IT'S IT'S IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE THAT WE IDENTIFY THE IT'S IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE THAT WE IDENTIFY THE COMPONENTS OF OUR PRODUCT
OKAY
HMM
MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
'KAY
MM
COOL
MM
THAT'S NOT BAD AT ALL
YEP
THANK YOU
OKAY UM I'LL DO SOME
I'LL RUB THE FEATURES AND LET THE DRAWING STAY
'KAY UM MY NAME IS GAURAV
UM MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ANIMALS IS A COW
I'VE GOT NO IDEA HOW TO DRAW A COW
UH THIS IS GOING TO BE
YEAH THAT'LL DO
OKAY SO LET LET ME DRAW THE BODY FIRST
BIG ROUND BODY REALLY SKINNY LEGS AND THEY'VE GOT A LONG TAIL AND A LONG FACE
AND THERE IS SOME GRASS THERE
SO THIS IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT COWS THAT THEY JUST KEEPS SITTING THERE EATING GRASS THEY DO NOT DISTURB ANYBODY UM THEY'RE KIND OF BUDDHIST IN A WAY
SO YEAH I LIKE COWS
UM MY MY ROLE IN THE PROJECT IS UM UH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
SO I'M SUPPOSED TO DESIGN ALL THE DETAILS OF OF THE PRODUCT UM HO HOW IT WORKS AND WHATEVER IT'LL MM TAKE DURING THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE
WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE PERFORMED BY IT UH DURING THE UM CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF IT AND UM FINALLY I'M NOT TOO SURE WHAT WAS THE LAST PART
UM THE DETAILED DESIGN I I GUESS IT WILL AGAIN BE THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE COMPONENTS AND HOW THEY INTEGRATE WITH EACH OTHER
UM I'M FROM INDIA
UH I'M DOING MY P. H. D. IN PSYCHOLINGUISTICS I SIT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY
YEAH
THANK YOU
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A COW DOES IT
NO WAY
AH OKAY
UH-HUH
MM
THANK YOU
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I THINK UH I IN THE BEGINNING UH ONE THING WAS THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE MM TRENDY
USER FRIENDLY AND ORIGINAL SO UM I THINK YOUR POINT IS RELEVANT AS FAR AS THE ORIGINALITY IS CONCERNED
THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDE SOME FEATURES THAT ARE QUITE UNIQUE TO THIS
MM
ALRIGHT
MM
YEAH
THERE IS A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY IN THERE THAT IS NOT USED NINETY PERCENT OF THE TIME BUT WILL BE USED TEN PERCENT OF THE TIME YEAH
YEP
AND THEN USE THE
MM
MM
UH WE CAN AIM FOR I MEAN WE CAN THINK ABOUT ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS BUT WE CAN AIM FOR SOMETHING WI THAT GIVES A HIGH BATTERY LIFE
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT UM IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM FOR REMOTE CONTROLS ANYWAY BATTERY LIFE UH EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU NEED TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES
UM
HMM
YEAH
A BIG LEARNING CURVE YEAH
YEAH
SO I IT SHOULD KIND OF FIT IN AS WELL AND THE STEREOTYPE OF A YEAH
ALRIGHT
HMM
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
DO I HAVE A CHOICE
OKAY
OOH OOH THINGS FALLING EVERYWHERE
RIGHT OKAY
COOL
OKAY
SO MY NAME'S CAT AND I'M REALLY NOT VERY GOOD AT THIS WHOLE DRAWING MALARKEY SO UM
OKAY
OH GOOD POINT
AH THE EYES ALWAYS RUIN IT
RIGHT
OKAY WHAT DO IT'S EYES LIKE
OKAY COOL
UM THIS IS A RABBIT
YEAH I DON'T THINK IT'S FURRY ENOUGH SO WE'LL MAKE IT A FLUFFY RABBIT
OKAY RIGHT IT'S A FLUFFY RABBIT BLUE
RABBITS DON'T COME IN BLUE BUT YOU KNOW
UM OKAY AND I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S SMALL AND IT'S FLUFFY
AND ONE DAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GETICAL GENETICALLY MODIFY THEM AND THEY WILL COME IN PINK
OKAY
I AM THE UM I NEED MY NOTEBOOK MM OOH TOP BANANA
THANK YOU
OKAY COOL I AM THE MARKETING EXPERT UM SO LIKE
I'M GONNA BE DOING THE APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THE LITTLE GUY IN THE COMPUTER THAT KNOWS EVERYTHING THE USER G REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION OF THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
UM TREND WATCHING IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND PRODUCT EVAD VALUATION IN THE DETAILED DESIGN UM SO YEAH
UM I'M FROM LEICESTER UM SECOND YEAR
UM WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
I LIKE SPORTS UM YEAH AEROBICS KICKBOXING SPINNING UM AND UH
NOT WITH RABBITS NO NO
AND VETS I LIKE VETS AS WELL
AND YEAH UM AND I LIKE COCKTAILS ESPECIALLY PINK ONES
OKAY
COOL
IS A BIT MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN MY RABBIT
I THINK IT NEEDS FOUR LEGS IF IT'S GONNA WALK THOUGH
THEY'RE NOT JUST LIKE A BIG ROUND BODY AND THEN SOME REALLY SKINNY LEGS AND THEN JUST SOME HORNS
IT LOOKS LIKE EEYORE
HORNS DRAW SOME HORNS
IS THAT A LIZARD
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE
IF YOU RIGHT CLICK ON IT YOU CAN
YEAH I WAS LOOKING AT THE WEBSITE
AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY'VE MADE AND I LIKE PUT DOWN SOME LIKE INSPIRATIONAL WORDS LIKE THAT I GOT FROM LOOKING AT THE PICTURES
SO THE MOTTO IS UM WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS AND UM SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS SLEEK AND STYLISH BUT IT'S STILL FUNCTIONAL YOU KNOW
SO I'M KIND OF THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE PHONES THAT THEY HAVE
THE NEW GENERATION ONES WHERE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY BUTTONS ON THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YOU KNOW SO SOMETHING HEADING TOWARDS THAT
SO IT'S NOT OVERLY I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT H MOST OF THE BUTTONS DO ON MY REMOTE CONTROLS
SO I FIGURE HOW MANY DO YOU NEED YOU KNOW
OKAY
SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE LESS CROWDED THAN THIS LIKE I MEAN YOU KNOW THEORETICALLY YOU CAN DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS WITH YOUR T. V. RIGHT
BUT WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO
THEY TURN IT ON THEY WATCH CERTAIN SPECIFIED CHANNELS YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY TURN IT OFF AGAIN
SOMETIMES THEY PLAY A MOVIE
YEAH SO
THERE'S NO NEED TO HAVE BUTTONS ON IT TO DO THAT MAYBE TO DO
YEAH
SO IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF SAD CASE THAT KNOWS HOW YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WORKS
THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S FINE AND YOU CAN DO IT ON THE SCREEN RATHER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE HAVING TO HAVE THOSE BUTTONS WHICH JUST CONFUSE THEM
HMM
'CAUSE LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRAIN IT'S JUST VERY LIKE THERE'S NO EXTRA BITS ON IT
THE TRAIN ON THE WEBSITE AND I DUNNO IF YOU CAN PUT IT UP ON THE THING UM BUT IT IS JUST LIKE A LONG LIKE THING USED FOR MU MOVING PEOPLE
BUT IT LOOKS REALLY PRETTY TOO
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO THIS IS UH FIRST MEETING OF
THIS DESIGN PROJECT
UM AND I UM LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE AGENDA FOR THE MEETING I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS SENT ROUND TO ALL OF YOU
MAYBE NOT
ANYWAY THIS IS THE THE PLAN FOR TODAY'S MEETING IS UM FIRSTLY JUST TO INTRODUCE THE PROJECT BRIEFLY
UM ALTHOUGH I'M SURE YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT SOME OF THE INFORMATION ALREADY
THEN THE MAIN PURPOSE IS TO SO THAT WE GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT MORE
UM THEN WE WANT TO PRACTICE USING SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WE'LL BE USING DURING THE THE COURSE OF THE DESIGN PROJECT AND THE MEETINGS
UM SPECIFICALLY THE WHITEBOARD OVER THERE
UM THEN WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THE SPECIFICS OF OUR PROJECT PLAN UM AND DISCUSS COME UP WITH SOME PRELIMINARY IDEAS ABOUT IT
AND THEN THAT'S IT
SO WE'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO DO THAT THAT'S UNTIL ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE
S SO ANY ANY QUESTIONS
IS I
NOT AT THIS POINT
SO THIS IS OUR PROJECT
WHAT WE'RE AIMING TO DO IS TO CREATE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR A TELEVISION
UM WE WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING ORIGINAL SOMETHING TRENDY AND ALSO SOMETHING USER FRIENDLY
SO IT HAS TO BE QUITE INTUITIVE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO USE THIS PRODUCT
THE METHOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT THAT HAS THREE COMPONENTS AS SUCH
THERE'S THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OF THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE'RE GOING THE WAY WE'LL DO THAT I THINK IS TO TO WORK INDIVIDUALLY INITIALLY AND THEN COME TOGETHER FOR MEETINGS TO TO WORK ON THAT
UM SIMILARLY WITH THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN WE'LL START OFF BY WORKING INDIVIDUALLY WITH OUR OWN EXPERTISE ON OUR OWN LAPTOPS AND THEN WE'LL BRING WHAT WE'VE DONE TOGETHER
UM AND THEN THE DETAILED DESIGN WILL COME AFTER THAT
WE'LL PULL IT ALL TOGETHER
I THINK IT TH W WE'RE TALKING THE THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IS MORE YOUR
UM AREA OF THINGS WHERE YOU'LL BE WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT FUNCTIONS WE NEED IN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WHAT WHAT SPECIFIC THINGS IT IT HAS TO DO BUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN IS UM PERHAPS BIGGER THAN THAT AND INCLUDES THE HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE IT AND AND THAT KIND OF THING
UM I THINK WE'LL WE'LL START THAT INITIALLY WITH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN ALREADY BUT THEN YEAH
OKAY SO THAT'S JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE P THE THE PROJECT ITSELF
UM WHAT I'D LIKE US TO DO NOW IS SIMULTANEOUSLY INTRODUCE OURSELVES AND START USING SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WE'RE USING FOR FOR THE PROJECT SPECIFICALLY THE WHITEBOARD
SO EACH PERSON IN TURN I'D LIKE US TO GO UP TO THE WHITEBOARD
THE PEN'S JUST UNDERNEATH IT THERE AND DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND THEN TELL EVERYONE WHAT THE F YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL ARE AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT TELL US YOUR NAME
WHAT YOUR ROLE IS AND PERHAPS HOW YOUR ANIMAL RELATES TO THE ROLE THAT YOU'RE TAKING IN THIS PROJECT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST
OH YEAH P PUT THEM IN POCKETS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURRY WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME
IT'S GOT NO EYES
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A CAT
YEAH I CAN SEE BY THE EARS
MM
EXCELLENT AND WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR ROLE WITHIN THE TEAM
MM-HMM
AND MORE ABOUT YOURSELF YOU'RE FROM
MM-HMM
BUT NOT WITH RABBITS
EXCELLENT TO MATCH THE RABBIT
THERE'S A AN IF YOU HAVE NOT ENOUGH ROOM THERE'S AN ERASER THERE AND YOU CAN RUB IT OFF
AH IT LOOKS LIKE A DOG
THE OTHER LEGS ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND WHERE WHERE ARE YOU FROM
ESTONIA
GOOD LUCK
MM
IT'S EATING
YEAH
EXCELLENT
RIGHT NOW NOW IT'S MY TURN OBVIOUSLY
OKAY HERE'S A SPACE
YEAH I LIKE THE COW
I'M JEN
UM I LIKE DOGS TOO BUT I CAN'T DO THAT ALREADY BECAUSE I CAN'T DRAW A DOG AS WELL AS YOU CAN
I LIKE
MM
HMM
IT'S A GECKO
YEAH
THEY'RE
YEAH THEY'RE L IT'S A KIND OF LIZARD
AND I I LIKE GECKOS BECAUSE THEY REMIND ME OF WARM PLACES AND
AND WHERE I WAS LIVING IN CAMBODIA THEY USED TO LIVE IN MY HOUSE AND THEY WERE ON THE CEILING AND THEY WOULD MAKE LITTLE GECKO NOISES IN THE EVENING
I DON'T LIKE SNAKES
I COME FROM AUSTRALIA AND WE HAVE NASTY SNAKES
THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM AUSTRALIA
I'M FROM MELBOURNE AND I'M YOUR PROJECT MANAGER FOR TODAY AND MY ROLE IS BASICALLY TO KEEP THINGS GOING AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL WORK TOGETHER
IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY SO THAT BY THE END OF THE DAY WE COME UP WITH A GREAT PRODUCT
OKAY
SO LET'S SEE WHAT'S NEXT IN THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
SO I'VE JUST THOUGHT YEAH I'VE JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THIS THAT WE COULD EVEN PUT IT MUCH MORE PROFESSIONALLY AS THERE WE GO
OKAY SO THIS IS THE UM OVERALL BUDGET FOR OUR
PROJECT
WE'VE GOT UM WE'RE PLANNING TO SELL THESE REMOTE CONTROLS FOR LET'S MAKE THAT GO AWAY THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES
UM WE'RE PLANNING TO SELL THE REMOTE CONTROLS FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS EACH
UM AND WITH THAT WE'RE AIMING FOR A PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS
AND THAT'S SELLING THEM ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET NOT JUST IN THE U. K.
UM SO TO DO THAT OUR FINANCE PEOPLE ESTIMATE THAT WE NEED PRODUCTION COSTS OF MAXIMUM TWELVE AND A HALF EURO SO THAT WE CAN REACH THAT
PROFIT TARGET
SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND WHILE YOU'RE DESIGNING
OKAY
HMM
THIS IS LET ME JUST SKIP AHEAD TO SEE THAT'S THE LAST THING OKAY
WE'VE ONLY GOT A COUPLE OF MINUTES
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY FIRST IDEAS TO BOUNCE AROUND ABOUT UM WHAT WE'RE THINKING OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT W IT'S BEST IF WE TAKE AWAY WITH US
BUT IF WE ALL HAVE A THINK WHEN WE GO AWAY FROM THE MEETING
WHAT SPECIFIC THINGS COULD BE UM INCLUDED IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL THAT THAT ARE OUT OF THE ORDINARY
SOMETHING SOMETHING NEW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
SO PERHAPS SOME SORT OF MENU BASED THING OR
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO NO
IT COULD BE ONE BUTTON FOR A MENU OR SOMETHING IF YOU REALLY NEED TO GO AND DO THAT
MM-HMM
EXCELLENT
OH I HAVEN'T HAD A LOOK YET YEP
MM-HMM
GREAT
ANY OTHER IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS BEFORE WE
MOVE ALONG
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
IT'S LIKE THOSE FANCY WEBSITES
THAT YOU CAN'T ACCESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO GET IN BUT THE DESIGNERS THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT
OKAY SO WE NEED TO WRAP IT UP NOW SO THAT WE CAN GO AWAY AND GET ON WITH SOME OF THIS
UM WE'VE GOT ANOTHER MEETING IN THIRTY MINUTES SO
YOU'RE YOU'LL BE GETTING SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ONCE YOU GO BACK TO YOUR WORKSPACE BUT IM BASICALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WORKING DESIGN
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
AND FOR YOU IT'S THE USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION LIKE YOU SAID AT THE START
OKAY
THANKS FOR THAT
UH I'LL SEE YOU IN HALF AN HOUR
CARRY THE LAPTOPS BACK AGAIN
DO WE NEED TO UNPLUG THINGS
PROBABLY
MM YEAH
I DIDN'T RECEIVE IT YET
NOT AT THIS POINT
YEAH WELL ORIGI UH AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE CAT
YEAH NOW I NOW I UNDERSTAND NOW YEAH
YEAH
AH
OKAY
UM SO MY NAME IS MAARIKA
WHERE'S THE PEN
OKAY
YEAH WELL OR I CAN MAKE IT SMALLER
UH SO UM UM I'M THE INTERFACE DESIGNER IN THIS PROJECT AND MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
I M I MEAN I'M NOT SO SURE BECAUSE I'M NOT SO SO VERY UM FAMILIAR WITH ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS BUT I DO LIKE DOGS
OH SORRY MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BEFOREHAND BUT MM-HMM
UM WELL THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DOGS BUT OKAY UM
OKAY
YEAH MAYBE IT HAS SOME COLOURFUL PATCHES YEAH
UM YEAH AND I DO LIKE DOGS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD FRIENDS TO PEOPLE AND THEY ARE LOYAL
MM WELL THAT'S COMPARED TO SOME OTHER ANIMALS LIKE CATS
UM THEY'RE REALLY MUCH MORE FUN BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SO INDEPENDENT
UM
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE THE FACT THAT THEY PROTECT THEIR HOME AS WELL YEAH
UM WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH WITH MY ROLE IN THE PROJECT IS HARD TO SAY
UH I HOPE TO BE LOYAL TO THE PROJECT AND NOT TO N NOT TO UM LET PEOPLE DOING SIMILAR PROJECTS KNOW THE DETAILS OF OUR PROJECT OR SOMETHING
YEAH
I'M FROM ESTONIA UH YEP
UM SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW
OH RIGHT MY ROLES UM SO UM IN THE DIFFERENT UM STAGES OF THE DESIGN
SO AT FIRST I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR UM FOR YEAH DESIGNING THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE UM
UM OF THE REMOTE CONTROL UH THEN IN THE IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STAGE I NEED TO UM COME UP WITH UH INTERFACE CONCEPT AND THEN IN THE LAST UM STAGE I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INT INFA FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
OKAY THAT'S IT
THANKS
IT LOOKS VERY VERY CUTE
YEAH
MM-HMM
WOW
AH A GECKO OKAY
IS A AR ARE THEY ALSO LIKE LIZARDS OR ARE THEY YEAH THEY ARE MM-HMM
AH
MM-HMM
I HOPE YOU DON'T LIKE SNAKES DO YOU
OKAY
MM-HMM
WONDERFUL
YEP
I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER WHETHER THERE IS LIKE ANY SPECIAL FEATURE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE W WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL HAVE AS OPPOSED TO THE ALREADY EXISTING ONES
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT UH I MEAN E EVEN THOUGH IT HAS TO BE RE ORIGINAL WE SHOULDN'T UH GO LIKE TOO FAR AWAY FROM FROM THE USUAL ONES
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE NEW USERS WILL JUST HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH L LEARNING YEAH YEAH
HM HMM
OKAY
THANK YOU
SEE YOU
MM
YOU SAID UH TARG TARGET GROUPS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
UH OKAY 'KAY
SO ARE
OKAY
ALRIGHT
I CAN GO FIRST YEAH
RIGHT
UM SO F FROM THE
RIGHT SURE
UH OKAY
SO N UH WITH UH WITH REGARD TO THE UH WORKING DESIGN OF THIS UH UH REMOTE CONTROL UH I'VE IDENTIFIED UM A FEW BASIC UH COMPONENTS OF THE REMOTE AND UH SE UH FROM THE DESIGN
FUNCTIONAL DESIGN PERSPECTIVE UM W I C WE CAN NOW UH KNOW WHA WHAT EXACTLY THE COMPONENTS ARE AND HOW HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER WITH EACH OTHER
SO
THIS IS THE METHOD THAT UH I'LL MOSTLY BE FOLLOWING IN MY UM IN MY UH ROLE
UM THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE COMPONENTS UH AND UH SINCE SINCE I'M DEALING ONLY WITH THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS
I WOULD NEED FEEDBACK FROM THE MARKETING PERSON UH AND UH FROM THE USER INTERFACE PERSON
UH WE'LL THEN INTEGRATE THIS INTO THE PRODUCT DESIGN AT A TECHNICAL LEVEL AND UH BASICALLY UPDATE AND COME UP WITH A NEW DESIGN SO IT'S A CYCLICAL PROCESS
OKAY SO THESE WERE THE BASIC FINDINGS FROM TODAY
THE LAST THREE BULLETS HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED FROM UH THE LAST MINUTE UH EMAIL
UH I JUST QUICKLY JOTTED THEM DOWN
UM SO BASICALLY UH THE AS I TOLD YOU THE IDENTIFICATION OF HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL WORKS AND WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS PARTS TO IT
UH AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES UM AND HOW THE PARTS UH COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER
UM OKAY SO E THE MEE EMAIL SAID THAT TELETEXT IS NOW OUTDATED SO WE NEED TO DO AWAY WITH THAT FUNCTIONALITY OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM ALSO UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE USED ONLY FOR TELEVISION BECAUSE INCORPORATING OTHER FEATURES UM MAKES IT MORE COMP COMPLEX
AND THE REASON WHY TELETEXT IS OUTDATED BECAUSE UH OF INTERNET AND UH THE AVAILABILITY OF INTERNET OVER TELEVISION
HOW HOWEVER OUR OUR REMOTE CONTROL WOULD ONLY BE DEALING UH WITH THE THE USE FOR TELEVISION IN ORDER TO KEEP THINGS SIMPLE
UM ALSO THE MANAGEMENT WANTS THAT UM OUR DESIGN SHOULD BE UNIQUE UH IT SO IT SHOULD INCORPORATE UM COLOUR AND THE SLOGAN UH THAT OUR COMPANY UM HAS IT AS ITS STANDARD
OKAY SO HE HE HERE IS A FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM THERE'S BASICALLY AN ENERGY SOURCE AT THE HEART UH WHICH FEEDS INTO THE CHIP AND THE USER INTERFACE
THE USER INTERF INTERFACE COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHIP SO I'LL BASIC GO OVER TO THE
OKAY
SO IF UH IF THIS IS OUR ENERGY SOURCE AND THIS IS A CELL UH IT COMMUNICATES UH IT FEEDS ENERGY INTO THE
INTO THE CHIP WHICH BASICALLY FINDS OUT H UH HOW HOW TO DO EVERYTHING
THERE IS A USER INTERFACE HERE
SO WHE WHEN THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON IT FEEDS INTO THE CHIP AND THE CHIP THEN GENERATES A RESPONSE AND TAKES THE RESPONSE TO AN INFRARED TERMINAL
UM WHICH THEN SO THE OUTPUT OF THE CHIP IS AN INFRARED BIT CODE
WHICH IS THEN COMMUNICATED TO THE REMOTE SITE WHICH H HAS AN INFRARED RECEIVER
UM THE THERE CAN BE UH A BULB HERE OR SOMETHING TO INDICATE WHETHER THE REMOTE IS ON OR COMMUNICATING
UM SO THESE ARE THE ESSENT SO A ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
WHATEVER NEW FUNCTIONS THAT WE NEED TO DO UM MAKE THE CHIP MORE COMPLICATED UH AND BIGGER BASICALLY
OKAY
UM SO I IN MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES UM I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN KE KEEP THE DESIGN AS SIMPLE AND CLEAR AS POSSIBLE
THIS WOULD UH HELP US UH TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AT A FUTURE POINT OF TIME
AND UH ALSO IF WE CAN INCORPORATE UH THE LATEST FEATURES IN OUR CHIP DESIGN
SO THAT OUR UM UH REMOTE CONTROL DOES NOT BECOME OUTDATED SOON AND IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH MOT MOST UH TELEVISIONS
THAT'S ABOUT IT
SO ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW OR
NO I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT WHAT EACH COMPONENT COSTS
UM YEAH
ANYTHING ELSE
YEAH
CERTAINLY YEAH
SO SO THA YEAH WE DEFINITELY NEED TO OPERATE WITHIN OUR CONSTRAINTS
BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY I I DO NOT HAVE ANY DATA SO UH I JUST IDENTIFIED THE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS FOR THAT
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
MM 'KAY
I IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME
OH THERE IT IS YEAH
IT'LL COME UP IT UM UH NO SIGNAL
YEAH YEAH IT SAYS SOMETHING NOW ADJUSTING
OKAY
OH THAT'S STRANGE
OKAY
AND ONE MORE TIME
MM
SORRY COU COULD YOU GO BACK FOR A SECOND
UH SWITCHING ON OFF CHANNEL UH VOLUME OKAY THAT'S GREAT
SO IN THE U USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS UH UH UH WE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE BASIC BUTTONS THAT WE DO WANT
UM BUT UM SO SO AT THIS STAGE
UH HOW WE GO ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THOSE BUTTON WE WILL NOT IDENTIFY OR I MEAN IN WE CAN COMPLETELY DO AWAY WITH BUTTONS AND UH HAVE SOME KIND OF A FANCY USER INTERFACE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT UH IS IS THERE ANY UH UH ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT
RIGHT
YEAH AND IT'LL MAKE THE COSTS YEAH
RIGHT
UH I THINK THE CO COSTS WILL ALSO PLAY A BIG ROLE WHEN WE COME TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
SO WELL WE CAN PROBABLY WAIT UNTIL T WE HAVE MORE KNOWLEDGE ON THAT
UH I IF THE IF THE COSTS ALLOW WE CAN HAVE LIKE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY AND UH WITH UM BECAUSE WE DO WANT SOMETHING FANCY AND FASHIONABLE AS WELL
SO YEAH
COOL
TRY TO PRESS OH OKAY YEP
MM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
HMM
RIGHT
MM
MM
MM
SOME KIND OF A RING SOME
RIGHT
HMM
OKAY THAT'S GREAT THANKS
MM
I THINK ONE OF THE VERY INTERESTING THINGS THAT CAME UP IN UM UH KA KATE CAT CAT'S UH PRESENTATION WAS UM UH THIS THIS ISSUE OF UH UH LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION BEING MORE POPULAR WITH UH YOUNGER PEOPLE
SO IF WE NEED TO HAVE A TARGET GROUP UM THEN UH I THINK AS FAR AS THE M MOTTO OF OUR COMPANY IS CONCERNED
IF WE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING SLEEK AND UH YOU KNOW
GOOD LOOKING UH WE ARE BETTER OFF TARGETING A YOUNGER AUDIENCE THEN UM YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPARATIVELY ELDERLY
UM
RIGHT
RIGHT
BU BUT BUT THE SURVEY DID SAY THAT F THINGS LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION ARE MORE POPULAR WITH THEM SO IF YOU WANT TO PUT IN SOMETHING STYLISH
THEN UH TH IT'LL CERTAINLY BE MORE POPULAR WITH THIS I YE WITH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE AS COMPARED TO OLDER PEOPLE YEAH
RIGHT AND
RIGHT
MM
RIGHT
BUT UH STILL IF IF YOU CAN GO BACK TO THAT SLIDE AND UH HOW POPULAR WAS IT
OH OH OKAY
THAT'S ALRIGHT IF YOU CAN JUST LOOK IT UP ON YOUR COMPUTER WH UH UM PEOPLE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE
UH HOW POPULAR WAS SO IT WAS STI STILL STILL QUITE POPULAR AMONGST THEM
SO EVEN THEY ARE SEVENTY SIX PERCENT IS THAT HIGH AMOUNT
ALRIGHT
YEAH
SO YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO B
YEAH
YEAH
MM
BU BUT EVEN EVEN IN THE CASE OF TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE IT'S QUITE POPULAR RIGHT
SO MM UH ARE ARE ARE
MM
MM
UM I WAS HAVING A A GENERAL OUTLOOK ON UM M MOST LIKE SOPHISTICATED FEATURES
BUT VOICE RECOGNITION ITSELF I'M NOT VERY SURE ABOUT
BECAUSE ONE OF THE P UH THINGS THAT CAT POINTED OUT WAS UH UH HOW DO WE GO ABOUT IMPLEMENTING IT
UH AND UH
YEAH
BUT HOW FREQUENTLY DO WE USE IT ANYWAY AND UM UH H HO HOW GOOD IS IT YOU KNOW UH VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARES ARE STILL QUITE UH
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
O
RIGHT
MM
RIGHT
YEAH
OKAY SO IT SEEMS LIKE A FEASIBLE THING TO IMPLEMENT UH FOR FOR A LIMITED YEAH
MM
W
WHAT UH
MM
WHAT WH UH WHAT I WAS THINKING IS THAT THERE IS THIS UH SEPARATION BETWEEN WHAT THE CHANNELS ARE ON T. V. AND HOW THEY ARE NUMBERED ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
IF WE CAN DO WITH AWAY WITH THAT OUR PRODUCT CAN BE REALLY POPULAR UH IN THE SENSE THAT UH A PERSON CAN SAY
I WANT TO WATCH UH I. T. V. ONE INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT I WANT TO GO ONTO CHANNEL NUMBER FORTY FIVE
YEAH SO IF UH IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED SOME KIND OF
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
YEAH THAT'S
RIGHT
MM
MM YEAH AND IT MIGHT BECOME VERY DIFFICULT FROM A DISTANCE FOR THE TELEVISION TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE OF THE NOISE FACTOR FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL BEING CL I MEAN IT'LL IT'LL MM
YEAH
MM
SO UH WH ANOTHER THING UH THAT CAN BE USED IS THAT UH THERE CAN BE A BEEPER BUTTON ON THE T. V.
SO YOU CAN GO AND PRESS THAT BUTTON AND UM AND THE REMOTE CONTROL
WHEREVER IT IS IT'LL BEEP SO WE WE CAN PROBABLY COME TO KNOW WHERE IT IS
RIGHT YEAH YEAH YEAH
ALRIGHT YEAH
RIGHT
OKAY
SO WHERE EXACTLY IS THIS I
AH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH IN THAT ONE RIGHT YEAH
NO
RIGHT
I GUESS I'LL FIND OUT
WHA WHAT WAS IT AGAIN THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK INTO
CON COMPONENTS OH
COOL
DO YOU WANNA GIVE ME THE LITTLE CABLE THING
YEAH
COOL
AH THAT'S WHY IT WON'T MEET
OKAY COOL
YEP COOL
OKAY FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
ALRIGHT YEAH
IT'S WORKING
COOL OKAY
SO
WHAT I HAVE
WH WHERE I'VE GOT MY INFORMATION FROM IS A SURVEY WHERE THE USABILITY LAB UM OBSERVED REMOTE CONTROL USE WITH UM A HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THEN THEY GAVE THEM A QUESTIONNAIRE
UM SO IT WAS ALL ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU KNOW
WHAT'S THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS AND UM THE POSSIBILITY OF SPEECH RECOGNITION AND L. C. D. SCREENS IN REMOTE CONTROL
NOT THAT THEY ACTUALLY GAVE ME ANY ANSWERS ON THE L. C. D. SCREENS SO I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT BIT OUT BUT ANYWAY
UM OKAY SO
WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HOW CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE SO YOU KNOW DEFINITELY YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
UH THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT HAVE NO FASHION SENSE
UH EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE TO GET UM YOU KNOW A NICE LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL
UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THEY DON'T MATCH THE USER BEHAVIOUR WELL AS YOU'LL SEE ON THE NEXT SLIDE
UM I DUNNO WHAT ZAPPING IS BUT
OH RIGHT
BUT YOU HAVE THAT LITTLE THING THAT COMES UP AT THE BOTTOM AND TELLS YOU WHAT'S ON
UM OKAY FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS SAY THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO THAT'S GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU KNOW
WE WERE SAYING EARLIER ABOUT YOU KNOW DO YOU NEED ALL THE BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL THEY JUST MAKE IT LOOK UGLY
OKAY
COOL
UM SO THIS IS MY LITTLE GRAPH THING
MM K
OKAY WELL I CAN SEND IT TO ALL OF YOU
WHAT IT IS IS UM IT'S CONES 'CAUSE I THOUGHT THEY'D BE MORE EXCITING
UM BUT OOH WHERE'S IT GO
BACK
OH
OH YES COOL
OKAY I'M GONNA STOP PLAYING WITH THE LITTLE POINTY THING
UM OKAY
SO LIKE WHAT IT SHOWS IS HOW MUCH THINGS ARE USED RELATIVELY AND WHAT YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE FROM THAT IS THE THING THAT'S USED MOST IS THE CHANNEL SELECTION
WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS VOLUME SELECTION IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN ALL THE OTHERS
YEAH SO WHAT THE GRAPH SHOWS IS THAT YOU KNOW POWER CHANNEL SELECTION AND VOLUME SELECTION ARE IMPORTANT AND THE REST OF THEM
YOU KNOW NOBODY REALLY USES AND SO THAT'S THE THE NUMBERS ALONG THE TOP REPRESENT THEIR LIKE UM THEIR IMPORTANCE
YOU KNOW SO ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT AND
YOU KNOW CHANNEL SELECTION AND VOLUME SELECTION ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND THE POWER
WELL IT'S NOT QUITE SO ESSENTIAL APPARENTLY ALTHOUGH I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT COULDN'T BE UM AND EVERYTHING ELSE
I THINK YOU KNOW YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT HAVING THOSE BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE THEY'RE JUST NOT NEEDED AND THEY'RE NOT USED
OKAY
THIS IS THE BIT THAT THE EMAIL MESSED UP FOR ME AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FIDDLING ABOUT WITH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THING
OKAY COOL
SO UM OKAY SO THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE FIND ANNOYING ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS
UH THAT THEY GET LOST THAT THE UH YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT INTUITIVE AND THAT THEY'RE BAD FOR REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
I THINK IF YOU'RE WATCHING ENOUGH T. V. TO GET REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY FROM UM YOU KNOW
WATCHING T. V. THEN THAT'S THE LEAST OF YOUR PROBLEMS BUT YOU KNOW IT'S UP THERE
UM THAT YEAH
OKAY SO UM I MEAN THE THE R. S. I. THING WOULD BE THAT
LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE THE COMPUTER KEYBOARDS AND YOU KEEP YOUR WRISTS UP WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT ENCOURAGES YOU WANT SOMETHING WITH AN ERGONOMIC T DESIGN THAT ENCOURAGES GOOD USE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND YOU KNOW
NOT STRAINING YOUR WRISTS WATCHING T. V.
YES
OKAY COOL
RIGHT UM SORRY THIS IS PINK BECAUSE I WAS COPYING AND PASTING THE TABLE AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO WHITE IT OUT AGAIN
UM OKAY BUT THAT SHOWS HOW PEOPLE WHETHER THEY WOULD PAY MORE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
SO YOU CAN SEE FROM THAT THAT YOU KNOW
YOUNGER PEOPLE TO THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE ARE QUITE LIKELY TO PAY QUITE A LOT MORE F WELL QUITE ARE QUITE LIKELY TO PAY MORE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
WHEREAS AS PEOPLE GET OLDER THEY'RE A BIT MORE SCEPTICAL ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE LESS WILLING TO TO TRY IT
UM SO CLEARLY VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT
BUT UM YOU KNOW I D I DO WONDER HOW WELL THAT WOULD WORK GIVEN THAT A T. V. YOU KNOW
TENDS TO BE PEOPLE TALKING AND UM YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STOP IT FROM JUST FLIPPING CHANNELS WHILST WATCHING T. V.
UM OKAY
COOL
UM OKAY SO THESE ARE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
SO YOU HAVE SLEEK STYLISH SOPHISTICATED YOU KNOW SO SOMETHING THAT'S YOU KNOW A BIT COOL
UM YOU KNOW FUNCTIONAL SO IT'S USEFUL BUT MINIMALIST
UM THERE'S A THERE'S AN IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE USE WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE FILLING UP YOUR HOME YOU KNOW
A LOT OF PEOPLE FILL UP THEIR HOME WITH BITS OF CRAP BASICALLY YOU KNOW
AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS STUFF AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE WHAT THE HELL IS THAT WHO IS EVER GONNA USE IT
YOU KNOW SO THINGS SHOULD EITHER BE FUNCTIONAL OR BEAUTIFUL OR PREFERABLY BOTH SO I THINK WE NEED TO AIM FOR BOTH
UM OKAY THEN A LONG BATTERY LIFE LIKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER AND UM
YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING THAT SOLAR POWER WOULD BE QUITE COOL BECAUSE
YOU KNOW YOUR REMOTE CONTROL JUST SITS THERE AND YOU COULD JUST SIT IT IN THE SUNSHINE AND SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT A BIT
UM AND THEN LIKE A LOCATOR SO YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE YOU HAVE FOR A MOBILE PHONE OR NOT A MOBILE PHONE
YEAH THAT'S IT YOU KNOW
I KNOW IT'S WEIRD
MY FLATMATE AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS ON THE WAY INTO UNI THIS MORNING AND I WAS LIKE I NEED TO GET ONE FOR EVERYTHING
SO YEAH SO MAYBE SOMETHING WHERE YOU CLAP AND THEN IT BEEPS SOMETHING A KIND OF SOUND THAT YOU DON'T OFTEN HEAR ON THE T. V. YOU KNOW
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BEEPING EVERY FIVE MINUTES 'CAUSE YOU YOU'D THEN DELIBERATELY LOSE IT BY THROWING IT OUT THE WINDOW OR SOMETHING
SO OKAY
COOL
THAT'S ME
CAT'S
CA
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S THE THING IS THAT IT DIDN'T SAY IN THE SURVEY YOU KNOW WHETHER
YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WILL PAY MORE FOR A MORE STYLISH REMOTE CONTROL BUT I'M ASSUMING YOU KNOW YES
WELL THAT'S WHEN YOU GO TO UNI ISN'T IT
SO YOU KNOW
YEAH
OH I'VE UNPLUGGED IT
DO YOU WANT ME TO
YEAH
SEVENTY SIX POINT THREE PERCENT
YEAH
YEAH I KN I MEAN I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS
BUT I MEAN IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT THAT PEOPLE OF THAT AGE GROUP HAVE A HIGHER DISPOSABLE INCOME BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE LIKE I MEAN
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE AT UNIVERSITY YOU'RE PAYING YOUR RENT BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A MORTGAGE YOU DON'T HAVE A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY YOU DON'T
NORMALLY HAVE A CAR YEAH SO
YOU'RE STILL LEARNING TO DRIVE ACTUALLY SO THAT JUST COSTS MORE THAN A CAR BUT YEAH
UM SO I MEAN LIKE IT IS AN AGE GROUP TO TARGET REALLY I THINK
NO I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THAT'S LIKE FIFTEEN POUNDS
YOU KNOW I THINK
YEAH I D I DON'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT A T. V.
WE DIDN'T HAVE A T. V. LAST YEAR AND EVERYONE THOUGHT WE WERE OFF OUR HEADS YOU KNOW
YEAH I D WELL WE'VE WE'VE GOT QUITE A D DECENT T. V.
YEAH
I THINK I THINK THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW NINETY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT OF FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS ARE SAYING YES
I WOULD PAY MORE FOR A VOICE RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL DOES SAY QUITE A LOT REALLY
YOU KNOW SO I MEAN THAT AND THE DISPOSABLE INCOME AND I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO IGNORE YOU KNOW
IS NOT A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW
NO DO TOTALLY
YOU DO HAVE IT IN YOUR MOBILE PHONE THOUGH DON'T YOU
BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIKE I MEAN EVERY MOBILE PHONE NOW HAS LIKE CALL THIS PERSON AND IT CALLS THEM
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
S SO
Y YOU'D MAYBE NEED A CODE WORD
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
SO LIKE WHEN YOU SAY CHANGE EXCEPT THAT'S BEING SAID QUITE A LOT ON T. V. SO MAYBE LIKE YOU KNOW REMOTE
I MEAN HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE SAY REMOTE ON T. V.
ALTHOUGH I ONLY WATCH CHARMED SO REALLY I WOULDN'T KNOW BUT LIKE SO YOU'D JUST SAY REMOTE FIVE YOU KNOW REMOTE TEN REMOTE ONE TWO NINE
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UH VOICE RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT
YEAH BUT THEN THE CODE WORD WOULD BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE I MEAN SKY ADVERTISE ON EVERY CHANNEL DON'T THEY YOU KNOW
SO THEN IT WOULD BE YOU'D BE WATCHING CHARMED AND THEN THE SKY ADVERT WOULD COME ON AND IT WOULD CHANGE TO SKY
YEAH YEAH AND THAT WOULD BE REALLY ANNOYING
YEAH
DO YOU NOT THINK THAT DEFEATS THE OBJECT OF HAVING VOICE RECOGNITION ON A REMOTE CONTROL THOUGH
YEAH YOU KNOW SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S MORE LIKE IF YOU LOST IT AND IT'S DOWN THE SOFA SOMETIME YOU CAN YELL AT IT AND IT'LL JUST CHANGE IT
YOU CAN LOOK FOR IT LATER YEAH
YEAH YEAH I SUPPOSE NEARER TO YOU BUT A B LIKE IF YOU HAVE SURROUND SOUND THEN
YEAH
YEAH 'CAUSE IT'S IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T LOSE THE THE BIT TO LOCATE THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH DEFINITELY YEAH
OH SO Y YOU WANT OUR UM POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS IN THERE HEY
OKAY
THERE YOU GO
BUT IS EVERYONE'S CALLED FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
OKAY SO THAT'S GOOD
THAT'S ME DONE
OKAY COOL
ALL HOOKED UP
OKAY SO NOW WE ARE HERE AT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING
UM HOPEFULLY THIS MEETING I'LL BE DOING A LITTLE BIT LESS TALKING THAN I DID LAST TIME 'CAUSE THIS IS WHEN YOU GET TO SHOW US WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING INDIVIDUALLY
THE AGENDA FOR THE MEETING I PUT IT IN THE SH SHARED DOCUMENTS FOLDER
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANT THAT YOU COULD SEE IT OR NOT
DID ANYONE
NO
OH WELL
UM I'LL TRY AND DO THAT FOR THE NEXT MEETING AS WELL SO IF YOU CHECK IN THERE THERE'S A SHARED PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER
UM AND IT SHOULD BE IN THERE
PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH
SO I'LL PUT IT IN THERE
IS IT BEST IF I SEND YOU AN EMAIL MAYBE TO LET YOU KNOW IT'S THERE
YEP
I'LL DO THAT NEXT TIME
UM I'LL ACT AS SECRETARY FOR THIS MEETING AND JUST TAKE MINUTES AS WE GO THROUGH AND THEN I'LL SEND THEM TO YOU AFTER THE MEETING
THE MAIN THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS MEETING IS YOUR PRESENTATIONS THAT YOU'VE BEEN PREPARING DURING THE TIME SO WE'LL GO THROUGH EACH OF YOU ONE BY ONE
UM THEN WE NEED TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE SENT TO US
I JUST SENT AT THE LAST MINUTE I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT WE CAN SEE HOW THAT AFFECTS WHAT YOU WERE YOU WERE DOING
UM AND THEN WE NEED TO
BY THE END OF THE MEETING COME TO SOME KIND OF DECISION ON WHO OUR TARGET GROUP'S GOING TO BE AND WHAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S THE THE MAIN GOAL IS TO COME UP WITH THOSE TWO THINGS
TARGET GROUP AND FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES TO DO THAT IN
SO
I WOULD
SAY YEAH
AS UH WHO IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TRYING TO SELL THIS THING TO YEAH
SO WE NEED TO YEAH
WE NEED TO HAVE A FAIRLY DEFINED GROUP THAT THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON AND THEN LOOK AT THE FUNCTIONS UM OF THE DEM REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
SO WITH THAT I THINK IT'S BEST IF I HAND OVER TO YOU
DOES ANYONE HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR GOING FIRST
YOU WANNA GO FIRST
OKAY SO WE NEED TO UNPLUG MY LAPTOP AND PLUG IN YOURS
I ASSUME WE JUST PULL IT OUT
JUST BEFORE YOU START TO MAKE IT EASIER WOULD YOU THREE MIND EMAILING ME YOUR PRESENTATIONS
ONCE WE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT NOW BUT WHEN ONCE YOU GO BACK JUST SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO SCRIBBLE EVERYTHING DOWN
HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
DO YOU HAVE ANY UM I IDEA ABOUT COSTS AT THIS POINT
BR
OKAY
'CAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER I GUESS IF WE'RE IF WE'RE USING MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IT MIGHT
INCREASE THE PRICE
YEAH
THAT'S FINE
ARE THERE ANY MORE
QUESTIONS OR SHALL WE JUST SKIP STRAIGHT TO THE NEXT ONE AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS ALL OF THEM TOGETHER AT THE END
YEAH I THINK THAT WILL DO
OKAY SO DO YOU WANT TO
YES SHALL SHALL WE PULL THIS UP
I THINK THAT HAS TO COME OUT OF THERE
YEAH
YEAH I THOUGHT THOSE LAST MINUTE THINGS THEY'RE GONNA HIT YOU THE WORST
IT TA TAKES A LITTLE
OH AND HAVE YOU YOU NEED TO THEN ALSO PRESS ON YOURS FUNCTION F. EIGHT SO THE BLUE FUNCTION KEY AT THE BOTTOM AND F. EIGHT
NOW IT'S COMING COMPUTER NO SIGNAL
MAYBE AGAIN
OKAY ADJUSTING
THERE WE GO THERE WE GO
OH IF YOU PRESS IF YOU PRESS FUNCTION AND THAT AGAIN THERE'S THERE'S USUALLY THREE MODES
ONE WHERE IT'S ONLY HERE ONE WHERE IT'S ONLY THERE AND ONE WHERE IT'S BOTH
OKAY SO ONE MORE TIME
SHOULD YEAH JUST WAIT FOR A MOMENT ADJUSTING
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
IF I MEAN THAT WAS THE THE DIRECTIVE THAT CAME THROUGH FROM MANAGEMENT
BUT IF WE HAD A A DECENT CASE FOR THAT WE REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE VIDEO AND D. V. D. I COULD GET BACK TO THEM AND SEE
IT'S W IT'S JUST WHETHER IT'S WORTH ARGUING ABOUT
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION OF MAARIKA BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM-HMM
SURE WE CAN DISCUSS THAT MAYBE AFTER THE NEXT ONE
DO YOU WANT TO YEAH
OH I'M GETTING HUNGRY
YOU SET
UH WE NEED TO DO THE FUNCTION KEY THING SO THAT IT COMES UP ON HERE
HELLO
IS IT PLUGGED IN PROP IT'S WORKING
OKAY
EXCELLENT
IT'S UM SWITCHING BETWEEN CHANNELS SORT OF RANDOMLY GOING THROUGH
MM
OOH THAT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE
IF YOU EXPLAIN IT TO US IT'LL BE FINE
YEAH
I LIKED THE I LIKED THE LITT OOH COME BACK
NO
OKAY
MM-HMM THAT'S THE NEXT ONE ALONG YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THE REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
THAT'S ALRIGHT
MM
KEYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YEAH
WHISTLE AND IT SCREAMS AT YOU YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'S YOU EXCELLENT
UM
I'M JUST GONNA TICK YES
SO WE'VE GOT ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES TO DISCUSS
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
THEN AGAIN I GUESS THE TH WHERE IT WAS MOST POPULAR WAS THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE BRACKET AND THE I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY'RE BUYING TELEVISIONS
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY GENERALLY
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT'S IT'S MORE THAT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE
WHEN PEOPLE ARE REALLY MOVING OUT AND THEY'VE GOT THEIR FIRST JOB AND THEY WANT THEIR NICE TOYS AND
O OH IT'S ON SORRY WE UNPLUGGED IT
HERE LET ME
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH THEY'VE GOT NO COMMITMENTS AND
USUALLY NOT A CAR AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS
KIDS
YEAH
YEAH AND IF WE'RE IF WE'RE TALKING TWENTY FIVE EUROS AS A PRICE THAT'S NOT UNAFFORDABLE EVEN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH
BUT DO THEY
BUT THE T. V. S ARE OFTEN KIND OF SOMEONE'S OLD T. V. THAT'S BLAH BLAH AND BE A BIT STRANGE TO HAVE A FANCY ROME REMOTE
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IF WE TA IF WE TAKE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BUT THAT THEN DOES IMPLY THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND INCORPORATE VOICE RECOGNITION
IS THAT GONNA HAVE A AN IMPLICATION FOR THE TECHNICAL SPECS
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
WITH UM BUT WITH A T. V. REMOTE IT'S GONNA BE QUITE LIMITED IF WE'RE T SAYING THE MAIN THINGS PEOPLE WANT TO DO IS ON OFF CHANNEL FIVE
LOUDER THA THAT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY SIMPLE
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT MAYBE IF YOU WANNA LOOK INTO THAT JUST TO JUST TO CHECK
UM SO IF WE GO FOR THE THE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE AGE GROUP
AND THEN OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GET TH ANYONE WHO'S OLDER THAN THIRTY FIVE WHO WANTS TO LOOK YOUNG AND HIP AND TRENDY AND HAS THE MONEY
THEN THEY'LL THEY'LL STILL GO FOR THE SAME ADVERTISING
YEAH I THINK WE NEED BOTH
YEAH
MM
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
SO THAT IF THAT WAS IN THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION THAT WOULD BE GREAT
YEAH
YEAH
WATCH SKY AND YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY A POSSIBILITY
YEAH
SO THAT YOU CAN YELL AT IT YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'S BUT THEN IF YOU'RE BUYING THE REMOTE SEPARATELY BUT Y YOU COULD HAVE SOMETHING
BUT I IF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD LIKE STICK ONTO THE T. V. OR SOMETHING
SOME LIKE A TWO P IF YOU BOUGHT IT IN A TWO PART PACK SO ONE PART ATTACHES TO THE T. V.
THE L
WELL THAT'S RIGHT BUT IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF HAVING DIFFERENT NOISES
YEAH
OKAY I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WRAP THIS UP UM
BUT IF WE GO AWAY WITH THAT THAT KIND OF GENERAL
UM SPECIFICATION IN MIND THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WE WANT IT TO LOOK SIMPLE
BUT STILL HAVE THE BUTTONS SO IT'S EASY TO USE BUT ONLY THOSE KEY BUTTONS THE MAJOR BUTTONS AND THEN ONE SORT OF MENU ONE
AND THEN VOICE RECOGNITION INCLUDED AS AN OPTION UM BUT THAT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORKING OUT AS TO WHETHER IT'S REALLY FEASIBLE AND SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS WE WERE MENTIONING UM
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS TO GO BACK TO OUR LITTLE PLACES
COMPLETE OUR QUESTIONNAIRE AND SOME SORT OF SUMMARISATION WHICH Y YOU'LL GET IMMEDIATELY BY EMAIL
SEND ME YOUR PRESENTATIONS SO THAT I CAN USE THEM TO MAKE THE MINUTES
AND THEN WE'VE GOT A LUNCH BREAK AND AFTER LUNCH WE GO BACK TO OUR OWN LITTLE STATIONS AND HAVE THIRTY MINUTES MORE WORK
UM I'LL PUT THE MINUTES IN THAT PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER BUT I'LL SEND YOU AN EMAIL WHEN I DO IT SO THAT YOU KNOW
IT SHOULD BE ON YOUR DESKTOP SO ON THE YEAH
SO I'LL PUT IT I'LL PUT THEM THERE AS SOON AS I'VE WRITTEN THEM
YEAH AND EMAIL THEM ROUND
YEAH THAT WOULD BE GREAT
OH YEAH PUT THEM IN THERE
YEAH THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO EMAIL THEM
NO THEY'RE ALL CALLED SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND SOMETHING SOMETHING YEAH
SO IF YOU PUT THEM IN THERE WE'LL ALL BE ABLE TO SEE THEM AND REFER TO THEM IF WE NEED TO
UM AS TO WHERE WE'RE GOING FROM HERE YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT
YEAH
WHATEVER THAT MEANS
YEAH
YOU'LL BE LOOKING YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT
ON SOMETHING CONCEPTUAL AND YOU'RE WATCHING TRENDS TO SEE HOW WE GO AND SURELY VOICE RECOGNITION'LL FALL OFF THE MAP OR SOMETHING THAT UM WE'LL KEEP KEEP OUR OPTIONS OP HMM
COMPONENTS YEAH
NO WE HAVE WE HAVE AFTER LUNCH WE HAVE THIRTY MINUTES TO OURSELVES TO PREPARE
SO THAT'S FINE W BEFORE LUNCH WE JUST HAVE TO COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND SOME SORT OF SUMMARY
OKAY
RIGHT ON TIME
OKAY SO YOU CAN I GUESS WE'LL SEE YOU FOR LUNCH IN A SEC
NO
MM
UM UM WI ON ON A WHAT
OH PROJECT PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH YEAH YEAH OKAY
OH OKAY YEAH
YES I THINK SO
YEAH THE LAST MINUTE YEAH YEAH
YEAH
UM
OKAY
HMM
MM
OKAY YEAH AFTERWARDS YEAH OKAY
THANKS
I THINK WE NEED LIKE SOME GENERAL DISCUSSION AT THE END PROBABLY
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SINCE SINCE WE WERE DISCUSSING SOME UM DESIGN ISSUES THEN I I I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE OKAY YEAH
THANKS
OH I
OKAY I HOPE WAIT
SHOULD IT JUST
THERE'S JUST NOTHING
OH RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT UM
OKAY
NOTHIN OKAY SOMETHING IS COMING UP
NO SIGNAL
WHY
OH
MY MY COMPUTER WENT BLANK NOW
ADJUSTING
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ON MY COMPUTER NOW
THIS IS THE PROBLEM BUT
UM
UH NOW IT'S OKAY
NO
NO
OH OKAY
OKAY THAT'S FINE THAT'S GOOD
OKAY LET'S START FROM THE BEGINNING
SO I'M GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN UH JUST LIKE SOME SOME FIRST ISSUES THAT CAME UP
UM 'KAY SO THE METHOD I WAS UM ADOPTING AT THIS POINT
IT'S NOT UM FOR THE FOR THE WHOLE UM PERIOD OF THE UM ALL THE PROJECT BUT IT'S JUST AT TH AT THIS VERY MOMENT
UM UH MY METHOD WAS UM TO LOOK AT UM OTHER UM REMOTE CONTROLS
UH SO MOSTLY JUST BY SEARCHING ON THE WEB AND TO SEE WHAT UM FUNCTIONALITY THEY USED
AND THEN UM AFTER HAVING GOT THIS INSPIRATION AND HAVING COMPARED WHAT I FOUND ON THE WEB UM JUST TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE DE WHAT THE USER REALLY NEEDS AND WHAT UM WHAT THE USER MIGHT DESIRE AS ADDITIONAL UH FUNCTIONALITIES
AND YEAH AND THEN JUST TO UM PUT THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IN IN WORDS
UM SO THE FINDINGS UH WERE UM THAT THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS IS JUST SENDING MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET SO THIS QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD
AND UH W SOME OF THE MAIN FUNCTIONS WOULD BE SWITCHING ON SWITCHING OFF
UH THEN THE USER WOULD LIKE TO SWITCH THE CHANNEL UM FOR EXAMPLE JUST M CHANGING TO THE NEXT CHANNEL TO TO FLIP THROUGH ALL ALL OF THE POSSIBLE CHANNELS
OR THEN MM UH THE OTHER POSSIBILITY WOULD BE THAT UM SHE MIGHT JUST WANT TO CHOOSE ONE PARTICULAR CHANNEL SO WE WOULD NEED THE NUMBERS
AND AND ALSO THE VOLUME IS VERY IMPORTANT
UM UM I ALS OKAY
'KAY
UM UM AMONG THE FINDINGS I FOUND THAT M M MOST OF THE CURR MM PRESENTLY AVAILABLE REMOTE CONTROLS ALSO INCLUDE OTHER MM FUNCTIONALITIES UM IN THEIR DESIGN
LIKE OPERATING A V. C. R. BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH D. V. D. PLAYERS
BUT THEN THERE ARE SURELY THERE ARE MANY OTHER FUNCTIONALI FUNCTIONS THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE ADDED TO THEM
BUT ACCORDING TO THE LAST MINUTE UPDATE UM ACTUALLY UM WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ALL THIS COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS ADDED TO OUR DESIGN
SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES WOULD BE UH TO KEEP THE MM THE WHOLE REMOTE CONTROL SMALL UM JUST LIKE THE PHYSICAL SIZE
AND THEN IT MUST BE EASY TO USE
SO IT MUST FOLLOW SOME CONVENTIONS UM LIKE WHEREABOUTS YOU FIND THE ON OFF BUTTON AND MAYBE THE COLOUR TENDS TO BE RED OR SOMETHING
UM THEN YEAH
THE MUST HAVE BUTTONS WOULD BE ON OFF AND THEN THE CHANNEL NUMBERS AND THEN UM THE ONE THAT ALLOWS US TO GO TO THE NEXT OR THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL
AND THEN VOLUME HAS TO BE THERE
BUT THEN UM OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES UM COULD BE JUST UH THERE COULD BE A MENU BUTTON AND YOU COULD CHANGE THINGS ON THE SCREEN THEN
UM FOR EXAMPLE BRIGHTNESS AND MM SIMILAR FUNCTIONS COULD BE JUST UM DONE THROUGH THE MENU
AND YEAH THE LAST QUESTION I HAD ABOUT WHETHER WE WANTED TO INCORPORATE N UH MORE FUNCTIONALITIES THE ANSWER WAS ALREADY NO BECAUSE OF THE LAST MINUTE UPDATE
SO AT THE FOR THE TIME BEING THAT'S UH THAT'S ALL
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
YEAH AND ALSO IT'S IT'S UM OTHER QUESTION IS UH BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT
AND THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE INCLUDED BECAUSE BESIDES VIDEO AND D. V. D. THERE ARE THE MM UM VIDEO C. D. S AND WHATEVER
SO IT MIGHT BE PROBLEMATIC TO TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ALL THESE POSSIBLE THINGS
UM WELL I THINK THE BUTTONS ARE STILL MM KIND OF THE MOST UM EASY FOR THE USER TO USE
I MEAN UM WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WOULD YOU HAVE
A LITTLE SCREEN OR SOMETHING
BUT THIS WOULD BE REALLY KIND OF I THINK A LOT OF LEARNING FOR THE USER AND AND I MEAN THE USER JUST WANTS TO GET UM GET A RESULT UM QUICKLY
NOT TO SPEND TIME IN LIKE UM GIVING SEVERAL ORDERS UM I DUNNO
I THINK I TH I WOULD I WOULD THINK THE PUT THE BUTTONS BUT IF IF YOU HAVE OTHER MM PROPOSALS UM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEP
UH AM I GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
NO
WAIT
OKAY HERE IT COMES
OKAY HERE YOU ARE
UM THAT'S VERY GOOD VERY INTERESTING
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YOU SHARE A TELEVISION OR SOMETHING THAT YEAH
IT WAS SEVENTY SOMETHING YEAH YEAH
YEAH THIS THIS IS NOT UNAFFORDABLE BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHETHER PEOPLE NEED IT WHETHER THEY DO HAVE A T. V. TO USE ITS FULL
YEAH
COMMON THE STUDENTS YEAH YEAH
THE S THE STU YEAH AND THE REMOTE CONTROL MIGHT NOT YEAH IT MIGHT NOT EVEN FUNCTION WITH THE OLD T. V.
YEAH WE'RE STILL YEAH
OR W MAYBE WE CAN JUST KIND OF UH UH
YEAH BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK MAYBE WE CAN WE CAN JUST DECIDE TO TO HAVE BOTH OF THESE GROUPS AS OUR TARGET
BECAUSE ACTUALLY I MEAN THEY'RE ALL STILL RE YOUNG PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT UH UM
YEAH YEAH SURE YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH W WELL NOW THE V THE VOICE RECOGNITION IF IF IT WORKS WONDERFULLY W WE COULD POSSIBLY DO AWAY WITH ALL BUTTONS
BUT I THINK THIS IS NOT REALLY THE RIGHT MOMENT YET
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST SO USED TO BUTTONS AND UM YEAH IT'S IT'S KIND OF SAFER SO WE WE NEED BOTH
SO THE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD BE JUST AN EXTRA IT WOULDN'T REALLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE
YEAH BUT M BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
REMOTE CONTROL ISN'T AS CLOSE TO YOU YOU PROBABLY MIGHT JUST JUST UH SPEAK INTO IT AND AND THE T. V. WOULD BE ALREADY FURTHER AWAY
SO IT MIGHT NOT PICK UP THE OTHER THINGS COMING FROM THERE
YEAH BUT THEN THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK I MEAN UM THE IDEA IS KIND OF IT'S IT'S NOT THAT IT'S SITTING THERE ON ON TOP OF THE TELEVISION
BECAUSE THEN YOU COULD ALREADY YELL AT THE TELEVISION AND YOU WOULDN'T YOU YOU WOULDN'T NEED THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL IS STILL SOMETHING YOU KEEP N NEAR YOURSELF
YEAH YEAH YEAH
NO BUT I I I WAS JUST DEFENDING THE THE FACT WHY WHY WE WANT TO KEEP THE REMOTE CONTROL CLOSE TO US
A AND UH NOT TO YELL AT IT FROM THE DISTANCE
OKAY
OH YEAH YEAH
OKAY YEAH MM-HMM
THE MAJOR ONES YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
DID YOU FIND IT
IT'S JUST YEAH YEAH
OH SO SO WE'LL JUST PUT THEM I THERE WE WE YEAH W WE WON'T EVEN OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
UH SOMETHING CONCEPTUAL YEAH
HMM
SORRY BUT UM THE NEXT MEETING UM ARE WE GOING TO HAVE IT UM RIGHT AFTER LUNCH OR SHALL WE PREPARE OUR
TO PREPARE OKAY YEAH THAT'S GOOD
OKAY
COOL
OKAY SEE YOU
RIGHT
OKAY
RIGHT S SO I HAVEN'T MADE A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION YEAH I I THOUGHT I'LL USE THE WHITEBOARD INSTEAD
UM MM OKAY
SO BASICALLY I'LL START OFF BY UH I THOUGHT I'LL USE THE WHITEBOARD BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS THAT WE CAN START UM UH RUBBING OFF THE OPTIONS THAT WE DO NOT REQUIRE AND PUTTING IN THE OPTIONS THAT UH ARE M OR HIGHLIGHTING OR UNDERLINING THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY
SO UH I'LL START AGAIN WITH A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO CONNECT THAT ANYWAY BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE INSIDES OF A REMOTE CONTROL AND UH THEN WE CAN PROBABLY UH DISCUSS THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS
YEAH
OKAY SO W WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS SO THIS IS THE OUTSIDE OF THE REMOTE RIGHT
IF YOU OPEN IT YOU HAVE A CIRCUIT BOARD HERE RIGHT AND THIS IS THE CHIP THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME
THIS BASICALLY SENDS INFORMATION TO A TR UH TRANSISTOR HERE WHICH THEN UH SENDS THE INFORMATION TO AN L. E. D. DEVICE HERE
IF YOU FLIP THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD AND THIS IS TH THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT HERE UH EVERYTHING ELSE IS KIND OF
OKAY SO IF YOU FLIP THE CIRCUIT BOARD THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
SO YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE A PARTICULAR BUTTON ATTACHES TO A PARTICULAR PLACE ON THE P. C. B. AND UH ON PRESSING THIS BUTTON I A CIRCUIT COMPLETES
THE INFORMATION GOES TO THE CHIP WHICH IS SOMEWHERE HERE AND THE CHIP THAT TRA THEN TRANSLATES THE CODE INTO AN INFRA INFRARED RADIATION
WHICH GOES GOES OUT THROUGH THERE
SO UH THE IMPORTANT POINT THAT I READ OVER THE WEBSITE WAS UH THAT THE CONFIGURATIONS OF THESE PRINTED CIRCUIT CIRCUIT BOARDS UH ARE QUITE CHEAP TO MAKE
YOU CAN GE GET THEM PRINTED AS YOU WANT TO SO W WE CAN HAVE A CONFIGURATION UM IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COST THE WAY WE WANT TO HAVE
RIGHT
SO THAT'S THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE SO THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE
OKAY
SO THE BATTERIES I'LL START WITH THE BATTERY RIGHT
SO THEY CAN BE SIMPLE WHICH IS LIKE UH THE NORMAL BATTERIES IN UH OUR UH THE CELLS YEAH
UH THES THESE ARE THE KIND DIFFERENT KIND OF BATTERIES THAT THE COMPANY MAKES RIGHT
SO
AND DYNAMOS
UM YEAH YEAH
SO UH I DON'T KNOW IF EVEN IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THIS BUT THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THE COMPANY MAKES
SO TH THEY'LL THEY'LL SINCE UH THEY'LL COME INTERNALLY FROM THE COMPANY THEY'LL BE EAS UH CHEAPER UH ALL THESE OPTIONS
SO THE THIRD ONE IS UH THE KINETIC ENERGY ONES
YEAH
YEAH IT'S A GOOD OPTION
THE THE KINETIC ENERGY ONE IS UH THAT E UH UH THEY ARE USUALLY MODERN WATCHES SINCE OUR HAND KEEPS MOVING IT KEEPS THE WATCH TICKING
BUT I DUNNO I IF IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR A REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'LL JUST LIE THERE FOR A LONG WHILE SOMETIMES
BUT AS SOON AS YOU PICK IT UP IT MOVES AND THEN AGAIN IT UH RE RECHARGES OR SOMETHING
AND THE FOURTH OPTION IS THE SOLAR CELLS WHICH ARE ALSO MADE BY THE COMPANY
ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY
OKAY UM SO I'LL LIST THINGS AND THEN WE CAN COME BACK AND DISCUSS WHAT WHAT WE THINK FROM UH EVERYBODY'S PERSPECTIVE
THERE ARE DIFFERENT CASES THAT CAN BE PROVIDED
THEY CAN BE BASICALLY THE SHAPE OF THE CASES THEY CAN BE FLAT THEY CAN BE CURVED WITH UH ONE SIDED
CURVED AND ONE SIDE FLAT AND THEY CAN BE CURVED WITH ON BOTH THE SIDES
THESE ARE THE THREE OPTIONS RIGHT
UM
YEAH WOULD IT BE FLAT ON BOTH THE SIDES WOULD BE CURVED FROM ONE SIDE OR WHATEVER UH THERE WERE DIFFERENT KIND OF SUPPLEMENTS AVAILABLE
UM LIKE IT CAN BE IN PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD OR TITANIUM RIGHT
WO WO WOOD
YEAH
NOT WOOL
OH REALLY
OKAY
UM THE SO UH WE CAN USE EVEN UM A CERTAIN TITANIUM IS ALSO USED UH IN THE COMPANY TO MAKE UH UH SOME SPACE DESIGN EQUIPMENT
SO IT'S KIND OF UM UH IT'LL BE PROBABLY NICER TO USE BECAUSE IT RELATES TO THE OVERALL IMAGE OF THE COMPANY
BUT UH IT CANNOT BE USED ON A DOUBLE CURVED SURFACE
IF WE CHOOSE THIS WE CANNOT USE TITANIUM
FOR FOR THESE TWO WE CAN USE TITANIUM WOOD RUBBER OR PLASTIC
YEAH
UH OKAY THE INTERFACE OPTIONS NOW
SO
WE CAN HAVE PUSH BUTTONS LIKE MOST REMOTES DO AND OUR COMPANY IS AN EXPERT IN MAKING PUSH BUTTONS
OOH
UH WE CAN HAVE SCROLL WHEELS LIKE THE ONES ON UM UH MOUSE POINTERS UH UH
YEAH YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO AND THEY HAVE THEY CAN EVEN HAVE AN AN INTEGRATED UH PUSH BUTTON INSIDE THE SCROLLING THING
THE SCROLL PLUS PUSH
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY DEVELOPED BY THE COMPANY UM IN THE LAST DECADE SO NOT TOO RECENT
AND L. C. D. S WE CAN HAVE L. C. D. S
SO THESE TWO ARE RECENT AND AND THIS IS Q QUITE OLD
THE VARIOUS ELECTRONIC OPTIONS ARE UM
UH SO TH THIS CONCERNS FIRS FIRST OF ALL THE THE CHIPS I I SHOWED YOU AT UH SO THERE'S THERE'S A CHIP BEHIND THIS ONE RIGHT
THE P. C. B. IS UH INEXPENSIVE SO WE CAN PUT PUT IN UH WHATEVER WE WANT
BUT THE VARIOUS INTEGRATED CIRCUIT OPTIONS ARE WE HAVE EITHER A SIMPLE ONE
OR A REGULAR
OR ADVANCED
AND UH THE PRICE GOES UP
AS WE GO DOWN OBVIOUSLY
UM OKAY
SO THE GOOD THING ABOUT UH WH WH WHY WHY WE WOULD WANT TO USE ADVANCED U WHY WE MIGHT WANT TO USE ADVANCED IS THAT L. C. D. S CAN ONLY COME WITH THE ADVANCED CHIP
UM THE WE NEED REGULAR OR ADVANCED FOR UH SCROLL WHEELS
RIGHT
UM AND THE CHIP BASICALLY INCLUDES THE INFRA INFRARED SENDER
YEAH
UH BESIDES THIS IN ELECTR UNDER ELECTRONICS UH ALSO THE COMPANY HAS STARTED MAKING A SAMPLE SENDER
WHICH IS DID NOT EXPLAINED WHAT I WHAT IT WAS BUT I'M GUESSING THAT UH SO THEY HAVE A SAMPLE SENDER AND A SAMPLE SPEAKER
SO I'M GUESSING THAT UH THE SAMPLE SPEAKER IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE UM UH YOU KNOW
AS SOON AS YOU PRESS A BUTTON IT IT MM UH GIVE GIVES YOU FEEDBACK ONE FIVE OR WHATEVER
YEAH ON
UM AND UH I DUNNO WHETHER SAMPLE SENDER SENDER HAS TO DO SOMETHING WITH VOICE RECOGNITION OR NOT BUT ANYWAY
SO THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE
OKAY SO TH THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY NOW NOW UH I THINK THAT UH WE CAN INTEGRATE UM UH YOU KNOW
UH THE USER INTERFACE UH AND UH THE MARKETING THINGS IN THAT KEEP UH TAKING OUT THINGS FROM THIS AND UH UNDERLINING THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT YEAH
YEAH YEAH SURE
SURE
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH IT SHOULD SHOULD DO IT
YEAH
THAT'S NICE ONE
MM
MM
UH SORRY UH CAN YOU GO BACK FOR A SECOND
UM UH ARE YOU SURE WHA WHAT THIS MEANS A SPINNING WHEEL WITH THE L. C. DISPLAY
UH OH YEAH ARE TH
OH OKAY THE IPOD THING YEAH
UH IT'S THE IPOD UH KIND OF UH
ALRIGHT RIGHT
OKAY OKAY
SO INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN YOU JUST SPIN YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
MM-HMM
RIGHT
SO MAYBE I SHOULD INCLUDE THAT HERE AS WELL L. C. D. S UM PLUS SPINNING
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO UM UH MAYBE UH AS YOU'RE DISCUSSING THINGS IS IT OKAY IF WE JUST UH KEEP HIGHLIGHTING THINGS HERE
RIGHT
SO MM UH SO IT YEAH SO PROBABLY VOICE RECOGNITION IS IS KIND OF IMPORTANT RIGHT
UM AND AN YEAH
OKAY I I HAVE A POINT ABOUT L. C. D. I DUNNO IF IT IS THE RIGHT POINT TO TAKE IT UP
W UH L. C. D. S ARE BASICALLY FOR FEEDBACK RIGHT TO THE USER WHO'S PRESSING BUTTONS
AND THE FEEDBACK CAN COME THROUGH TELEVISION ITSELF SO DO WE NEED AN L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE
MM
RIGHT
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE YEAH THAT'S ALSO
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM RIGHT
OKAY
SO NOW WE SEEM TO HAVE A CONSENSUS THAT L. C. D. S ARE DEFINITELY THE WAY TO GO BECAUSE OF STYLE AND
RIGHT
YOU YOU AGREE
MAARIKA YEAH
YEAH
SO L. C. D. S YEAH DEFINITELY
GO ON
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM
YEAH WE WE HAVE WE HAVE RUBBER BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT I FORGOT TO DISCUSS WITH THE UM WITH USING
SO IF IF WE USE UH LATEX CASES THEY WON'T ALLOW US TO USE SOLAR CELLS AS AN ENERGY SOURCE THAT IS THE CONSTRAINT
SO UM WE COULD USE TITANIUM WOOD OR PLASTIC UH OR UH
YEAH W ENERGY SOURCE
YEAH TAP IT ON THE DESK YEAH
MM
SO PROBABLY DOUBLE CURVED SURFACE IS THE WAY TO GO YEAH
OR OR CURVED AT ONE END AND FLAT ON THE TOP BECAUSE I I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS FLAT ON BOTH BOTH THE SIDES
THEN HO HOW MUCH EASY WOULD IT BE TO REACH FOR BUTTONS ETCETERA
UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SINGE SINGLE SIDE CURVED OR DOUBLE SIDE CURVED DOES NOT SAY TOO MUCH DOES IT
IT UH
MM
UH I THINK UH
RIGHT
RIGHT
DI NOW DID IT SAY ANYWHERE IN YOUR RESEARCH MATERIAL ABOUT THIS SLIDING STUFF UH BECAUSE UM ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE
I THINK UH THE ONL ONLY OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE CASE IS ARE THESE THREE
UH EITH EITHER WE HAVE UH A FLAT SURFACED UH CASE OR A CURVED SURFACED CASE
IT DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT UH WHETHER TECHNICALLY YOU KNOW THIS THIS STUFF IS AVAILABLE AT ALL
RIGHT YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
OKAY
COOL THANKS
YEAH
LET'S LET'S TRY TO R RUB OFF THINGS AND YEAH SO UM HAND DYNAMOS ARE DEFINITELY OUT RIGHT
YOU YOU GOT A WIND DYNAMO YEAH
OKAY
UM KINETIC ENERGY DOES SEEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF UH UH APPEAL BUT UH
IT'S
YEAH
AS AGAINST A WATCH WHICH CONSTANTLY KEEPS MOVING THIS THIS THING WILL HAVE TO BE TAPPED EVERY TIME WHICH WHICH MIGHT BE VERY FRUSTRATING FOR THE USER
KINETIC ENERGY IT NEEDS I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TECHNICAL INFORMATION ON THAT YEAH RIGHT
OKAY LET'S KEEP IT OPTION UH KEEP AN OPTION YEAH
UM THE FLAT CO COMPLETELY FLAT CASE IS DEFINITELY OUT RIGHT
IT HAS TO BE AT LEAST CURVED FROM ONE SIDE YEAH
UM OKAY WE STILL HAVE ALL ALL THE OPTIONS
WOOD DO YOU THINK WOOD WILL BE A GOOD IDEA
MM
RIGHT
YEAH IF IF IT IS REALLY THIN IF IT IS REALLY THIN IT IT'S LIKELY TO BREAK IT'S IT'S MUCH MORE UH
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH OKAY WOOD IS OUT
RIGHT
OKAY NOW FOR THE REALLY INTERESTING STUFF THE INTERFACE
RIGHT SO UH THE THE PUSH BUTTONS IS IS OUR EXPERTISE UH IN THE INDUSTRY
BUT UH IT SEEMS TO BE OUT OF TREND YOU KNOW NOBODY SEEMS TO BE
MM RIGHT
OH IF IF WE HAVE L. C. D. DISPLAYS THAT OPENS UP A WHOLE WORLD YOU KNOW
IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY THEN MM YOU CAN SELECT ALMOST EVERYTHING ON THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
RIGHT
OKAY
MM RIGHT
SO UH IN IN THE BUTTONS WE HAVE FOR THE CHANNELS ALSO WE HAVE OPTIONS
DO YOU DO WE ENUMERATE EVERYTHING FROM ZERO TO NINE
OR DO WE HAVE JUST UH CHANNEL PLUS CHANNEL MINUS JUST TO JUST TO SCROLL
THE NUMBERS
RIGHT
OR ON THE L. C. D. WE CAN YOU KNOW
OKAY
SO MM
ALRIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY SO BUTTONS DEFINITELY IN BUT OH SHALL WE UH TRY TO DRAW A PREC UM
UH OKAY
OKAY OKAY SO THE COMPONENTS
RIGHT SO UH WHAT ABOUT THE THE SCROLLING UH
MM UM
I'M NOT SURE IT'LL BE A GOOD IDEA TO CONSTRUCT THE WHOLE THING OUT OF RUBBER
UH I IT
OR OR AT THE CORNERS EDGES JUST THE EDGES COVERED BY RUBBER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
EVERYTHING ELSE IN PLASTIC OR EVEN TITANIUM IF WE WANT TO USE IT
MM-HMM
RIGHT RIGHT
RIGHT OKAY SO SO THAT GIVES US A MORE TRENDY LOOK AS WELL
UM
RIGHT
YEAH AND UH WE'RE GOING MORE FOR THE TRENDS THAN FOR THE USABILITY ANYWAY RIGHT
SO
I'LL RUB THAT OUT
AND UH COLOURS CAN BE PROVIDED WITH THE CASE RATHER THAN
UM BUT WE STILL NEED TO TE THINK ABOUT THE COLOUR OF OUR REMOTE AS SUCH YOU KNOW JUST KEEP IT BLACK OR
MM
OKAY
UM OKAY IF YOU G GO OVER TO UH THE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
UH SINCE WE'RE HAVING L. C. D. S THERE THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE'RE WILL BE ABLE TO UM WHAT WE DO NEED TO CONSIDER
HOWEVER IS THAT THE PRICE IS GOING UP FOR THE EVER EVERY SUCH THING THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING
BUT SINCE L. C. D. S SEEMS TO BE UH A DEFINITE YES SO IT SEEMS TO BE ONE AREA WHERE WE WOULD WANT TO SPEND
SO I'LL RUB OFF THE OTHER TWO
OH IS OH THE CONSTRAINT WAS UH YEAH
YEAH
SO
I THINK UH WE'LL HAVE UH UH USING THE SIMPLE BATTERY WILL BE A SAFER OPTION AS COMPARED TO THE KINETIC ENERGY ONE
I MEAN A ALTHOUGH IT DOES SEEM UH INTERESTING
BUT IT DOES NOT HOLD ANY ADVANTAGES AS SUCH FOR A YEAH
OKAY
UH OKAY SO R WE UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER NOW THAT UH THE THE SPEAKER IS FOR THE FEEDBACK RIGHT
IT IT SAYS UH THE THINGS THAT YOU TYPE IN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO
YE YEAH WE WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT IT UM
YEAH OKAY SO SO TH THIS IS IN AS WELL THEN THE SAMPLE SPEAKER
RIGHT
FLAT ON THE TOP
YEAH
OKAY
I. C. S
UH INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
YEAH
UH UM WE WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING IN FOR VOICE RECOGNITION AS WELL AS L. C. D. S MM
RIGHT
YEP
MM
MM-HMM
COOL
YEAH OKAY
DOES THAT MEAN LIKE A WIND UP ONE
A WIND UP REMOTE
YOU COULD MAKE THE HAND DYNAMO INTO AN EXERCISE BIKE AND THEN PEOPLE COULD EXERCISE WHILST WATCHING T. V.
YEAH AND STOP WORRYING ABOUT THE WHOLE R. S. I. FROM THE REMOTE THING 'CAUSE THAT'S JUST
YAY
DID YOU SAY WOOL
WOOD
OH RIGHT
YEAH YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN WE GET TO MY PRESENTA
SONY
SONY ERICSSON MOBILE PHONES HAS IT
MM
NO IT'S GOT ITS LITTLE CAMERA IN THERE PLUG IT IN
'S A
UGLY
YEAH YOU CAN'T
OH IT'S LIKE THE IPOD
G YEAH NO YOU CAN
IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE WHERE YOU YOU KNOW HOW YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR MOUSE
AND Y YOU GO ROUND AND I IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT AND YOU SPIN ROUND AND IT YEAH
IT IS
YOU JUST GO ROUND AND IT IS A BIT WEIRD AT FIRST BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY LIKE FAST
I LIKE THE THE WHEELS THAT CLICK ON THE SIDE YOU YOU GET 'EM MUCH SLOWER SO IT'S QUITE GOOD IF YOU LIKE SEARCHING QUITE A LOT OF STUFF
DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE LOOKIN IF YOU'RE TH SCROLLING THROUGH THE A. TO Z. OF YOUR MUSIC AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AT T.
THEN IT'S A LOT FASTER THAN THE WHEEL BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER IT
OKAY I'VE PUT THE COPY OF THE PRESENTATION IN UM THE YEAH
COOL
FABULOUS
OKAY COOL
UM SO WHAT I DID WAS TO SEARCH THE INTERNET TO COME UP WITH MARKET TRENDS AND YOU KNOW WHAT USERS ARE GONNA BE WANTING IN THE THE NEAR FUTURE
OKAY
RIGHT
NOW THE FIRST ASPECT IS APPARENTLY TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SECOND ASPECT WHICH IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE THIRD A ASPECT
SO I MEAN THE THE EASY TO USE THING IS FAIRLY LOW DOWN ON THE WHICH I THINK GIVEN THE TARGET GROUP IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT REALLY
UM YOU KNOW PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING NEW SOMETHING TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENT
SO THE WHOLE IDEA WITH THE L. C. D. S AND THE SPINNING AND THE COLOURS AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS QUITE LIKE QUITE THE THING TO GO FOR
AND UM YEAH IT WANTS TO LOOK FANCY FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
SO
YEAH YEAH
MM
DEPENDS HOW FAST YOUR TELEVISION RUNS REALLY DON'T DON'T YOU THINK
I MEAN WE'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE UM TELEWEST BOXES AND YOU PUT THE NUMBER IN THE REMOTE AND THEN YOU WAIT AND THEN IT GOES TO THE T. V. AND THEN YOU WAIT
AND THEN IT COMES SO I IT ACTUALLY TAKES QUITE A LONG TIME
AND IF YOU GET THE NUMBER IN WRONG THEN IT'S A BIT OF A PAIN SO I THINK
YOU KNOW A SCREEN ON THE REMOTE WOULD PROBABLY CUT DOWN YOUR TIME ON THAT
BUT LIKE REMOTES DO TEND TO GET F THROWN ABOUT A BIT
YOU KNOW
YEAH
AND I IT WOULD BE LIKE I MEAN IF YOU COULD MAKE IT INTEGRATE WITH THE T. V. THEN IT COULD COME UP WITH NEW INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S ON
AND YOU COULD JUST SEE THAT ON THE REMOTE RATHER THAN
YEAH
BUT UM I THINK MAYBE A WAY TO DO IT WOULD BE A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW YOU HAVE YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU KNOW
LIKE YOU HAVE THE SLIDEY ONES AND YOU HAVE THE FLIPPY ONES AND THEN THE SCREEN'S PROTECTED SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET SCRATCHED
SO YOU CAN HAVE LIKE WHAT LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL YOU KNOW OR LIKE A MINIMALIST REMOTE CONTROL
SO YOU GOT YOUR BUTTONS ONE TO NINE YOUR ON AND OFF AND YOUR VOLUME ON THAT AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO MESS ABOUT WITH IT
YOU FLIP IT OPEN AND YEAH
YEAH SO THAT KIND OF DECIDES YOUR WHOLE CHIP THING
OKAY
COOL
OKAY APPARENTLY FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WILL BE PROVIDING INSPIRATION
SORRY I DISCOVERED CLIP ART
UM SO THESE WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE
SO I MEAN I'M TAKING THIS TO MEAN YOU KNOW CURVINESS
DO YOU KNOW
'CAUSE YOU DON'T TEND TO GET FLAT VEGETABLES
YOU KNOW
YEAH BIT OF ASYMMETRY AND STUFF
BUT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO TO GET IN THE WHOLE UM R. S. I. ISSUE IN THERE
BECAUSE I MEAN IF YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE USE THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH THEIR RIGHT HAND HA RIGHT HANDS SO YOU WANNA YOU CURVE IT SO THAT IT'S SUITABLE FOR USE WITH THE RIGHT HAND
UM YEAH I'M NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF MATERIAL WILL BE SPONGY
UM
YEAH BUT I MEAN Y YOU HAVE TO
WELL I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET A REMOTE UH AN ELECTRIC SHOCK OFF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IF IT WAS MADE OF RUBBER
YEAH YEAH
IF IT'S MADE OF RUBBER YOU COULD GET THE KINETIC ENERGY FAIRLY EASILY THERE YOU COULD JUST BOUNCE IT UP AND DOWN
YEAH
UM SO YEAH UM OKAY
YEAH YEAH
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF FLATNESS I THINK
IT IT DEPENDS ON THE WHOLE ERGONOMICS OF IT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE HOW YOU PUT YOUR HANDS SO Y IT'S THE LEAST MOVEMENT BASICALLY
NO I D I DON'T THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE
I I HAVE ONE OF THOSE S SLIDEY PHONES AND I MEAN THE BACK IS ESSENTIALLY STRAIGHT BUT IT'S CURVY SO
BESIDES YOU HAVE FOUR SIDES TO A THING SO I MEAN DOES CURVED ONE SIDE MEAN ONE SIDE IS STRAIGHT AND
YOU KNOW CURVED TWO SIDES MEANS THE WHOLE THING IS JUST A BIG CURVY P THING
YEAH
YEAH
UH IT'S IT'S MORE ABOUT THE PROTECTING THE L. C. D. WHICH I THINK IS WHERE IT CAME FROM
BUT NO MY RESEARCH DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE ALL THE PICTURES 'CAUSE I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO WITH MY TIME
OKAY COOL
UH COMBINE STYLE WITH A LEVEL OF FUNCTIONALITY UM BEAUTY AND PRACTICALITY AND A THING OF BEAUTY AND P FUNCTION
OKAY
IT'S ABOUT THE PRACTICALITY OF IT REALLY ISN'T IT
YOU KNOW
I MEAN IF
I CAN'T IMAGINE A M WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL
WELL IT'S NOT VERY CLEANABLE EITHER DO YOU KNOW
IT'S IT'S NOT A PRACTICAL I MEAN IT'S IT'S ALRIGHT FOR A TABLE BUT FOR A REMOTE CONTROL YOU KNOW
AND SPLINTERS AND STUFF AND
IT JUST M DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE I THINK IS THE THING WITH WOOD
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME PUSH BUTTONS DON'T YOU
G YEAH YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THIS IS GOING BACK TO THE THE GRAPH AT THE BEGINNING THAT I MADE WHERE YOU KNOW THE BUTTONS THAT PEOPLE USE ALL THE TIME
YOU WANT BUTTONS FOR THEM AND EVERYTHING ELSE MENU DRIVEN
YEAH
YEAH
G YEAH I WOULD THINK BUTTONS YEAH
IT'S IT'S THE I THINK THE THING IS SO IF SOMEONE JUST WANTS TO TURN ON THEIR T. V. AND PUT ON A CHANNEL
THEN IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE THAN ANY OTHER REMOTE AND THEN IF SOMEONE WANTS TO YOU KNOW
CHANGE THE CONTRAST ON THEIR T. V. AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND IT SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE BUT YOU KNOW
I MEAN MOST OF THE TIME I MEAN THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH THE BIGGEST TECHNO GEEK CAN SPEND FIDDLING WITH THE T. V.
I THINK IS THE THE THE ISSUE THERE
E EITHER OR
G YEAH
I WOULD SAY THE S THE S THE SPINNING GOES AT A HIGH SPEED TO TH TO THE SCROLLING WHEEL
SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO BE GOING SO FAST OR NOT
BUT I MEAN THE THE THING WITH THIS WHOLE IF Y YOU'RE PLANNING ON MAKING IT OUT OF RUBBER
ON THE BASIS THAT IT'S SPONGY THEN I'M NOT SURE HOW WELL A SCROLLING WHEEL WOULD WORK
YEAH BUT Y YOUR SPINNING WHEEL TENDS TO GO TO ONE SIDE
YOU WANT AN OUTSIDE OF RUBBER AND THEN OPEN IT UP AND
OR MAYBE LIKE INTERCHANGEABLE CASES
'CAUSE I KNOW LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK TO IPODS AGAIN N THE WHOLE SPINNING WHEEL
BUT I HAVE LIKE A YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY MY IPOD'S NOT MADE OF RUBBER
BUT THEN I HAVE A LITTLE RUBBER CASE THAT GOES OVER THE TOP OF IT AND I CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR THEORETICALLY TO MATCH MY OUTFIT
YEAH I THINK THE SPINNING WHEEL IS DEFINITELY VERY NOW
YEAH
THAT DOESN'T FIT IN WITH THE WHOLE VEGETABLE THEME THOUGH
YEAH
BUT I MEAN DO YOU THINK WE COULD INCORPORATE THE COLOURS OF THE COMPANY INTO THE BUTTONS AND THEN MAKE THE COLOUR OF THE MAIN REMOTE THE COLOUR LIKE VEGETABLE COLOURS
DO YOU KNOW
SO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE I MEAN I SUPPOSE VEGETABLE COLOURS WOULD BE ORANGE AND GREEN AND SOME REDS AND UM MAYBE PURPLE AND THAT AND THEN YOU'D PICK THE BUTTONS IN COMPANY COLOURS TO TO MATCH WITH IT
SO ARE WE DISCOUNTING SOLAR ENERGY BECAUSE RUBBER'S GONNA BE USED IN THERE SOMEWHERE OR
IF SOLAR PANELS WITH THE RUBBER
YEAH OKAY SO WE LOSE THAT I THINK
YEAH
IT'S JUST A GIMMICK
YEAH SURE J
SORRY DO YOU WANT ME TO
WHAT DOES UM I. C. S. MEAN
OKAY COOL
SO IT'S ADVANCED INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
IMAGINE IT WOULD BE INSIDE
SO UM ACTUALLY THAT COULD LIKE REALLY CUT DOWN YOUR THING SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR OUTSIDE WHICH IS LIKE MINIMALIST
AND THEN YOU OPEN IT UP AND YOU'VE GOT A SCREEN AND A SPINNING WHEEL WHICH YOU CAN INCORPORATE BUTTONS INTO
UM SO YOU'VE STILL NOT GOT LIKE A LOT OF STUFF IN THE
YOU'VE MAYBE GOT YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU'RE MODELLING ON IPOD YOU'VE GOT FIVE BUTTONS AND A WHEEL
AND FOUR OF THE BUTTONS ARE IN THE WHEEL AND THE OTHER ONE'S THE LITTLE BIT INSIDE THE WHEEL YEAH
COOL I'M GONNA GO AND SIT ON MY OWN
I KNOW I'M HATED
I'VE GOT A BIT TANGLED UP IN ALL THIS
EXCELLENT
SO UM I SENT YOU THE AGENDA IT WAS ON THE IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT A CHANCE TO JUST HAVE A LOOK AT IT
ANYWAY IT'S THE MEETING'S GONNA FOLLOW MORE OR LESS THE SAME STRUCTURE AS LAST TIME
SO WE'LL GO ROUND EACH OF YOU IN TURN AND YOU CAN GIVE YOUR PRESENTATIONS ON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO
UM AND AT THE END OF THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS WHAT YOU'VE COME UP WITH SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A DECISION ON THE KEY REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS
SO THAT'S WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE COMPONENTS' PROPERTIES MATERIALS THE USER INTERFACE AND ANY TRENDS THAT THE MARKETING EXPERT HAS BEEN WATCHING
OKAY
UM DO YOU WANNA START AGAIN
LET ME WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES
YOU HAVEN'T MADE A POWERPOINT OKAY
MM-HMM
LET'S HOPE THE PEN HOLDS OUT
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
AND CHARGING THEIR REMOTE YEAH
UH YEAH
MM-HMM
FOR A REMOTE 'CAUSE YOU
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
WOOD WOOD
A FLUFFY REMOTE
HUH
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
EXCELLENT
DO YOU WANNA STAY SOMEWHERE NEAR THE BOARD SO THAT IF WE NEED TO YOU CAN SIT DOWN BUT JUST WE MIGHT NEED YOU TO LEAP UP
WHAT ARE YOU POWERPOINT OR
OKAY
DO YOU THINK THESE PENS CAN GIVE YOU CANCER OF THE HAND
SOME SORT OF RADIATION
YEAH
RIGHT INTERFACE CONCEPT
THAT'S FINE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
IT'S YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH HI YEAH
IT'S LIKE THE LIKE YOU SAID NO
THE SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
EXCELLENT
OKAY STRAIGHT TO TRENDS AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS IT ALL AT ONCE
THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS
EXCELLENT
IF YOU TWO COULD BOTH DO THAT AS WELL IN CASE WE NEED TO REFER TO IT
HERE IT COMES
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH SURE
YEAH
THAT'S OVER ON THE INTERFACE IF IF YOU COULD PUT
YEAH
AND MAYBE THE L. C. D. AND SPINNING SO THAT MEANS WE NEED AN ADVANCED THING
MM-HMM
MM
IT IT IS ALSO QUITE NICE THOUGH TO TO HAVE SOMETHING HERE SO YOU DON'T INTERRUPT THE PICTURE ON THE SCREEN SO IF YOU'RE WATCHING SOMETHING
YEAH
RATHER THAN HAVING TO INTERRUPT YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE
MM
YEAH
AND THEN YOU CAN FLIP IT OPEN
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH AND POSSIBLY EVEN UNEVEN LIKE NOT NOT SYMMET YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SOMETHING A BIT SQUISHY AND
YEAH AND IT'D HELP IF YOU DROP IT IT PROTECTS IT AS WELL
TO SOME DEGREE
UH-HUH
OR IF WE WANT TO USE THE THE LATEX THEN WE HAVE TO GO WITH ONE OF THE OTHER UM POWER THINGS
FROM FROM BOUNCING IT
YOU CAN HAVE IT AS LIKE A LITTLE BALL TO BOUNCE THAT FLIPS OPEN
MM YEAH
UH-HUH
MM
YEAH 'CAUSE THE
YEAH
DUNNO
NOTHING TO OPEN THEM
ANYTHING ELSE
WHAT'VE WE GOT
OKAY SO
LOOKING AT WHAT WE'VE GOT WE WE WANT AN L. C. D. DISPLAY WITH A SPINNING WHEEL
YEAH RUB OFF SOME OF THOSE
YEAH IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT STREAMLINED AND SEXY HAVING A HAVING A WIND UP
I THINK THA
DEPENDS HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MOVEMENT IT REALLY NEEDS
PR PRESUMABLY IF THEY'RE SUGGESTING IT THEN WE COULD USE IT
I'D I'D KEEP IT ON
WE DON'T WANT THAT IT'S NO IT'S NOT NOT VEGETABLE
MM
MM
YEAH AND GIVEN THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE SPONGY MATERIAL PREFERENCES I HA WOULD THINK MAYBE RUBBER OR PLASTIC IS MORE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
JUST FOR FAST
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND IT YEAH L. L. C. D.
DO WE NEED THEM ON AS BUTTONS OR DO WE NEED THEM AS L. C. D.
BUTTONS
MM
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA DO NEXT SO IF WE PUT DOWN THE KEY UM THINGS THAT WE WANT
JUST SPINNING AND NOT SCROLLING I WOULD SAY
YEAH
HMM
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A IF IF YOU'VE GOT A FLIPPED THING
EFFECTIVELY IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CURVED ON ONE SIDE AND FLAT ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT YOU FOLDED IT IN HALF
TH THAT WOULD BE ON ONE SIDE UH-HUH
NO I THINK IT'S JUST THE CASING RUBBER ON THE OUTSIDE
YEAH
YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE AFTER
MM-HMM
I GUESS
BANANAS
MM-HMM
GREEN
YEAH
WE NEED THE ADVANCED YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT WAS THE
WE CAN'T HAVE SOLAR PANELS WITH RUBBER SO
SHALL WE GO FOR IF WE'RE GOING FOR RUBBER WE THINK UH ON AS OUR CASE AND THEN
YEAH
WE'VE GOT FIVE MORE MINUTES
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
I THINK IF WE CAN IF WE CAN INCLUDE THEM AT NOT TOO MUCH EXTRA COST THEN I'D PUT THEM IN BUT IF IT'S
YEAH
IT'S FROM THE COMPANY SO
YEAH
OKAY
AND THE CASE IS CURVED ON ONE SIDE BUT THEN FLAT FLAT SO IT'S FLIPPED INTO EACH OTHER
CAN I PULL THE THING OUT THE BACK OF YOUR COMPUTER
JUST SO WE CAN
NOTHING IT'S RIGHT I'M JUST
THERE WE GO
UH OH NOW I'VE GONE TOO FAR
YEAH
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
OKAY
SO WE'VE BASICALLY WORKED OUT THAT WE'RE GOING WITH A SIMPLE BATTERY
THE ADVANCED CHIP AND A CURVED ON ONE SIDE CASE WHICH IS FOLDED IN ON ITSELF UM MADE OUT OF RUBBER AND
THE BUTTONS ARE ALSO RUBBER
WE'RE HAVING PUSH BUTTONS ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEN ON THE INSIDE AN L. C. D. WITH SPINNING WHEEL AND WE'RE INCORPORATING VOICE RECOGNITION
THAT'S OUR OVERALL CONCEPT AND IT'S GONNA LOOK SORT OF VEGETABLE AND BE IN BRIGHT VEGETABLE COLOURS
I THINK IT'S ON THE
MM MM
YEAH
ON THE
MM-HMM
IN THE CENTRE YEAH SURE
OKAY SO NOW WE'VE GOT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE OUR NEXT MEETING
IN THE MEANTIME THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER OVER HERE IS GONNA WORK ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN WHICH I'LL PRESUME HE'LL WORK OUT WHAT THAT MEANS
UM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER WILL WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND THE MARKETING EXPERT IS GOING TO WORK ON PRODUCT EVALUATION
AND AS WELL AS THAT
THE TWO DESIGNERS ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON OUR PROTOTYPE FOLLOWING THOSE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WE'VE JUST COME UP WITH USING MODELLING CLAY AND YOU WILL GET EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH
IS THAT ALL OKAY
AND ANYONE WHO HASN'T PUT THEIR THEIR PRESENTATION IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IT WOULD BE GOOD JUST SO IN CASE WE HAVE TO REFER TO IT
Y AH NOBODY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU
UNPLUG YOURSELF
I DUNNO MAYBE I WOULD CAR
SO WHAT WAS WHAT WAS THIS K KA
OKAY
MM-HMM
UM YOU MEAN THIS WOULD BE LIKE THE THE OVERALL SHAPE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL YEAH MM-HMM
YEAH MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
UM I HAVE SOME POWERPOINT YEAH
OH
'KAY
OKAY
OKAY
UM TO BE HONEST ACTUALLY I MENTIONED SOME SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH WHICH COULD FIT ON THE ON THE THIS TALK UM THIS TIME
I M I MENTIONED THEM ALREADY IN THE PREVIOUS TALK
SO UM YEAH THIS TIME UM I MIGHT NOT HAVE THEM ON THE SLIDES BUT I I CAN JUST MENTION THEM AW AGAIN
OKAY
SO UM I THOUGHT UM I WOULD ALSO INCLUDE THE DEFINITION OF USER INTERFACE UM SO IT'S THE ASPECTS OF A OF OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM OR PROGRAMME WHICH CAN BE SEEN UH BY THE USER UM AND AND WHICH UH THE MECHANISMS THAT THE USER USES TO CONTROL ITS OPERATION AND INPUT DATA
SO THIS WOULD P INCLUDES THINGS LIKE SHAPE AND SIZE AND BUTTONS AND UM VOICE RECOGNITION AS WELL AND COLOUR AND SO ON
UM UM THE METHOD I EMPLOYED THIS TIME WAS A AGAIN HAVING A LOOK TO RELATED PRODUCTS AND MAINLY ON THE INTERNET AND THEN UM ANALYSE THEM UH FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF USER FEN FRIENDLINESS AND ALSO UM WHETHER THEIR APPEARANCE WAS WAS PLEASANT
UM AND THEN UM THIS UH THIS UM
THIS CAN HELP US TO DECIDE WHICH FEATURES WE WANT TO INCORPORATE IN OUR PRODUCT
SO SOME FINDINGS UM UM
SO IN IN THE CASE OF MANY USER INTERFACES
THEY'RE JUST SO FULL OF BUTTONS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY UH HARD TO FIND THE ONES YOU YOU REALLY UM WANT TO USE AND UM AND IT'S JUST CONFUSING
IT TAKES Y KNOW TIME TO LEARN
UM OKAY AND I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST QUICKLY SHOW SOME OF THEM THAT I FOUND
OKAY SOME OF THEM ARE HERE
UM WELL THE PICTURE IS NOT VERY CLEAR BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE ACTU OI OH OH OH SORRY FOR THAT
'S GO BACK
AH NO PLEASE
OKAY SO YEAH THEY'RE QUITE BIG AND HAVE MANY MANY BUTTONS
ACTUALLY OF THE OF ALL THESE I PERSONALLY P PREFER THIS ONE
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE SMALLEST AND AND WITH WITH LEAST UH WITH THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF BUTTONS AS WELL
AND I WOULD SAY EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF SOME OF THEM IS KIND OF NOT SO NICE
UM OKAY
SO LET'S CARRY ON WITH THIS
UM
SO UH UM O OTHER FINDINGS UM SOME NEW THINGS UM USED UH SOME OF THEM WERE MENTIONED ALREADY BY OUR TECHNICAL UM DESIGNER UH
OUR OWN COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED A NEW IN USER INTERFACE UH WAIT NO THIS IS NOT THE ONE
OKAY THERE IS A WE CAN UH INCLUDE VOICE RECOGNITION AND UM IT ALLOWS I IT'S POSSIBLE TO RECORD EIGHTY DIFFERENT VOICE SAMPLES ON IT
UH SO UH THIS UH THIS ONE WAS ALREADY MENTIONED UH THE L. C. DISPLAY
UM S ANOTHER NEW DEVELOPMENT IS A SCROLL BUTTON WHICH WAS ALSO TH ALSO ALREADY MENTIONED
AND UH OUR OWN MANUFACTURING DIVISION HA HAS UH DESIGNED A NEW UM
UH PROGRAMMABLE SPEECH UH
MM SORRY UH SPEAKER UNIT I GUESS IT'S IT SHOULD BE
UM AND THIS MEANS THAT UM ONCE UH UH IT IT IT COMES TOGETHER WITH A VOICE RECOGNITION
BUT IT'S ONCE ONCE THE MM UM GADGET UH RECOGNISES UH THE VOICE OF THE SPEAKER
THERE CAN BE A UM PRE PROGRAMMED ANSWER FOR EXAMPLE
YOU CAN PICK UP THE REMOTE CONTROL AND SAY SOMETHING TO IT LIKE HELLO AND IT SAYS SOME HELLO AND YOUR NAME OR WHATEVER
SO I MEAN THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE N DEV NEW DEVELOPMENTS WHICH WE MIGHT CONSIDER IF WE WANTED TO INCLUDE
NO NO THE SCROLL BUTTON IS A DIFFERENT THING
I I HAVE A PICTURE IF YOU JUST A MOMENT I'LL I'LL SHOW YOU
I WASN'T COMPLETELY SURE MYSELF BUT I THINK IT'S JUST LIKE UM IT'S IT'S A WHEEL IT'S LIKE NOT SEPARATE BUTTONS
LOOK THIS ONE HERE
BUT I'M I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHETHER WHETHER YOU CAN REALLY TURN IT ROUND IT'S LIKE YOU PRESS THIS OR THIS OR
UH-HUH
MM
UH
OKAY AND THE PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS AS AS LAST TIME
IT IT HAS TO BE SMALL SIMPLE
OKAY WE DECIDED TO INCLUDE VOICE RECOGNITION SO TO HAVE THE STANDARD UH MAJOR BUTTONS LIKE ON
OFF UM CH THE CHANNELS AND AND THEN UM VOLUME AND THEN THE REST WOULD BE A MENU ON THE SCREEN
UM AND I I ALSO THOUGHT UH IF WE WANT TO KEEP IT SMALL AND NICE UM AND ACTUALLY I I QUITE LIKE THE IDEA OF A SCROLL A SCROLLING BUTTON
I THOUGHT IT COULD BE FOR FOR VOICE LIKE I DUNNO IT MM LIKE ON A UM I LIKE IT USED TO BE ON WALKMANS OR SOMETHING
THERE IS UH I THINK THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE COULDN'T USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S IT
YEP YEAH
MM-HMM
SO IT COULD BE LIKE A RUBBERY YEAH UH-HUH
THANKS
YEAH UH HUM YEAH
YEAH IT'S YEAH
N WOOD IS I CAN'T N HOW DO YOU UH I MEAN YOU CAN'T KEEP IT REALLY SMALL UH YOU CAN'T MAKE IT LIKE THIN AND
THE WOOD THING
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO YOU N YOU NEED TO PUT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY IN
SO I MEAN IF THE CASE YOU ADD THE CASE AND IT IT BECOMES A BIT BULKY WI MM MM YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
U YEAH WOOD IS NOT REALLY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH IN THE CASE OF REMOTE CONTROL NOT REALLY
YEAH BUT YOU UM I THINK FOR FOR THE CHANNEL NUMB UH CHANNEL NUMBERS YOU STILL NEED THEM WOULDN'T YOU
YEAH SO FOR CHANNEL NUMBERS BUT
BUT I TH YEAH BUT I THINK THE L. C. D. DISPLAY IS KIND OF YEAH
IT'S FASTER WITH A M YEAH AND W IF WE DIS AND WHEN WE S UM DISCUSSED THAT WE MIGHT LIKE THIS FLIPPING OPEN THING
THEN I MEAN Y YOU CAN USE IT AS A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL BUT IF YOU DO WANT TO USE L. C. D.
THEN YOU FLIP IT OPEN BUT IT'S IT IT'S MORE TIME CONSUMING
YEAH
NO NO I MEAN MM WE WE DEFINITELY NEED THE THE NUMBERS BECAUSE IT'S UH OTHERWISE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO FLIP THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS
UM
YEAH I WOULD SAY BUTTONS BECAUSE IT'S YEAH
I
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH BUT N I I'M NOT COMPLETELY UM COMPLETELY CLEAR UH I YEAH ABOUT THE SPINNING WHEEL
SO I THINK IT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE BOTH LIKE A SCROLLING AND SPINNING THING
IT'S UH YOU CAN AL INCLUDE EVERYTHING IN THE SPINNING IF YOU YEAH YEAH IN THAT CASE
AH BUT I MEAN YOU CAN
YEAH I UM I THINK SO TOO I MEAN THE CASE WOULD BE YEAH THE CASE WOULD BE RUBBER AND THE THE BUTTONS
RUBBER BUTTONS BUT THEN
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK WE UM IT WAS A A REQUIREMENT THAT WE USE OUR UM TH THE COLOURS OF OUR COMPANY
SO WOULD IT BE LIKE YELLOW GREY AND BLACK OR SOMETHING OR
YEAH DOES
YEAH
BANANA'S YELLOW YEAH DEFINITELY
MM-HMM
AND THE BUTTONS AS WELL I THINK
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT IT I THINK IT SHOULD BE QUITE CHEAP BECAUSE IT'S FROM OUR OWN COMPANY YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM
UH-HUH
SO W W WOULD WITH HAVE THE SPINNING WHEEL INSIDE WITH THE L. C. D. OR WOULD IT BE ON THE OUTER
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
SO BUT SHALL I MOVE AWAY FIRST OR SHALL I STAY HERE WITH WE NEED TO
I'M PROUD OF IT
UH-HUH
HOW HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES
YEAH
OKAY SO
PRESENTATION
OKAY
OKAY
SO UM BASICALLY GOING WITH OUR TREND OF VEGETABLES AND WE SELECTED THE COLOUR AND APPROXIMATE SHAPE OF BANANA
UM
YEAH
UM
YEAH
UM SO BASICALLY IT'S THE IT'S THE FLIP OPEN THING AGAIN
SO NOW WE WE HAVE THE OKAY SO MA MAARIKA WILL EXPLAIN YOU THE USER INTERFACE THERE
AND IT FLIPS OPEN ON THE SIDE SO IT OPENS LIKE THAT
AND WE HAVE THE USER INTERFACE O IN HERE AND UH THE THE L. C. D. AND AND THE SCROLL ARE INSIDE
UM
WELL EVERYTHING ELSE IS PROBABLY USER INTERFACE SO
YEAH YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH IT HAS YEAH
YEAH WELL BUT I SINCE IT'S MADE OF RUBBER ANYWAY
I I THINK IT'S IT'S UH
YEAH
MM
HMM
IT'S ON THE SIDE
UH NO WE WE'D NOT PUT SO ON ON THE COVER WE HAVE THE THE BARE ESSENTIALS
UH ON THE L. C. D. WE R YOU KNOW THE MAIN MENU WILL HAVE VARIOUS OPTIONS
MM
MM
YEAH IT'S HIDDEN IN THERE SOMEWHERE
COOL
WE RAN OUT OF RESOURCES HERE SO
YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK
YEAH SEE THE BUDGET
I GUESS WE'LL GIVE IT MAXIMUM POINTS IN EVERYTHING
SO
YES
OKAY
BUT WE CAN WE CAN I CAN I CAN TAKE NOTE UH UH
UM THE THE ONLY THING THAT WE WERE CONSIDERING WAS THAT UH THIS THING IS KIND OF MORE FOR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE THAN FOR LEFT HANDED PEOPLE
SO IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED YOU'RE KIND OF LEFT UH SCROLLING WITH YOUR FINGER
BUT THEN YEAH
YEAH
SO BU IT'S IT'S NOT A HUGE PROBLEM BECAUSE I I IT IS OPERATABLE
RIGHT
YEAH
YEP
MM
MM
ONE MORE THING IS THAT I
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE CLUMSY WHEN WHEN IT OPENS UP RIGHT SO IT OPENS ON THE SIDE
SO
YEAH YEAH YEAH I MEAN YEAH
SO YOU GUYS CAN DECIDE WH WHETHER
OOPS
YEAH BUT WE WHICH MAKES IT KIND OF REALLY BIG YEAH
UH THIS THIS KIND OF UH MAKES IT MORE AND TWO IT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE I. R. CHANNEL
OKAY
RIGHT
OKAY
NO WE HAVE A LOCATOR
YEAH
YEAH
INTUITIVE COMPLETELY INTUITIVE
INTUITIVE
AND UH EVEN THE SCROLL
IT'S A IT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY SO M M MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET USED TO IN THE BEGINNI SO IT IS KIND OF NOT VERY INTUITIVE BUT UH IT'S A GOOD TECHNOLOGY
I MEAN ONCE THEY GET USED TO IT
YEAH
SO L
YEAH OKAY
I'M GONNA GIVE A SEVEN IN EVERYTHING SO
MM
YEAH
YEAH UNLESS YOU ARE A ALL THE TIME SITTING
YEAH
YEAH I I THINK IT IS ERGONOMIC
MM YEAH
AND MOREOVER IT IT HAS UM L. C. D. AND EVERYTHING SO THAT UH YOU KNOW UH WE MINIMISE THE PRESSING OF THE BUTTONS ANYWAY
ABSOLUTELY
SO IT HAS VOICE CONTROL
YEP
ANYWAY IT HA YEAH IT'S THE MOST SOPHISTICATED REMOTE THAT I EVER SEEN
YEAH BUT THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A REMOTE
YEAH
ABSOLUTELY
THE CARROT BANANA REMOTE
I THINK THAT'S A
YEAH
THERE ARE HOW MANY SIXES
ONE TWO THREE
THREE
AND ONE FIVE
OKAY TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT FO FORTY SIX
FORTY SIX AND FIVE FIFTY ONE
FIFTY ONE DIVIDED BY
MM I GUESS IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR A BIT
MM
ADVANCED YEAH
YEP
MM ANYTHING UH I THINK WHICH IS NOT MORE
YEAH
MM
NO UH WE WE HAVE UH YEAH
MM NO
WE DON'T HAVE WE'RE NOT USING ANY OF THAT
HUH
WH WH WHAT IS THE LIMIT
UH
MM I DON'T THINK SO NO
NO IT SAYS WHAT WHAT IS THE KIND OF INTERFACE IF IT IS PUSHBUTTON THEN YOU GOT A ZERO POINT FIVE
IT'S A SCROLL WHEEL SO WE WE'VE PUT IT'S PUSHBUTTON AND SCROLL WHEEL AND L. C. D. DISPLAY SO THAT'S THAT'S THE THREE KIND OF INTERFACES THAT WE HAVE
WH WH WHAT'S OUR CRITERIA
UH OKAY
UH IT DOES NOT HAVE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION BUT IT DOES HAVE FOR THE FEEDBACK SPEAKER
WHEN YOU SAY WHEN YOU PRESS ONE IT SAYS ONE OR IT SAYS HELLO
MM AND THE LOCATOR ALSO GOES AWAY
A ALSO I IN THE CASE I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU WILL EVALUATE THIS AS A CURVED SURFACE
BECAUSE IT'S JUST RUBBER SO IT'S PROBABLY A FLAT SURFACE RUBBER
UH I MEAN UH UM YEAH
UM
SO THA THAT MEAN THAT WE CANNOT PRESS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MAKE A SELECTION IN UH IN THE L. C. D.
IF IN THE L. C. D. WE CAN SCROLL RIGHT
BUT HOW DO WE MAKE A SELECTION IF WE D CANNOT PUSH THE BUTTON
NO W W W BUT HA IT'S IT'S THE SCROLL WHEEL AND I THOUGHT WE WERE REFERRING TO THIS AS A SCROLL SPINNING WHEEL AND PUSHBUTTON THING
THAT COMES WITH THE L. C. D.
OH SO SO THE THE THIS IS
SO WE'RE ADDING COSTS FOR RIGHT OKAY UH I MEAN I THINK THIS IS GOOD
INSTEAD OF SCROLLING HERE WE HAVE TWO BUTTONS HERE UP FOR UP AND DOWN
ON THE SIDE
MM UH IT SOUNDS GOOD ACTUALLY YEAH
WE HAVE YEAH
NOT REALLY NO
BECAUSE WE KEEP ALL THE FEATURES WE KEEP VOICE RECOGNITION WE KEEP L. C. D. DISPLAY
WE INSTEAD OF HAVING SCROLLING WE WE JUST PUSH THE BUTTONS
UM YEAH
YEAH
BUT WE LOSE THE LOCATOR
SO INSTEAD OF SPEAKER
'KAY
I THINK IT MM
I THINK UH N ONE THING THAT WAS LACKING UH WAS THAT WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE VARIOUS THINGS COST TO BEGIN WITH
UM WE KAP KEPT A ADDING THINGS RANDOMLY
SO HAD WE KNOWN
YEAH THAT OR NOT YEAH
YEAH
SO D ALL THE RANDOM DECISIONS AT THE END COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED
MM
YEAH MM
YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S IT'S IT'S I WONDER WHAT ONE OF THESE COSTS
YEAH
MM YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
I GUESS IT WAS A FAIRLY SMALL GROUP SO ALL OF US GOT TO EXPRESS OUR OPINIONS YEAH
MM
HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOOD THOUGH BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GIVEN TOO MUCH TIME THEN YOU GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR TIME AND UM YEAH
ALTHOUGH WE COULD HAVE MADE THE R. S BETTER HAD WE HAD FIVE MORE MINUTE
WE CERTAINLY ARE MM
YEAH
YEAH SAME HERE
MM UH NO
I DON'T THINK SO
WAS THERE A QUESTIONNAIRE ALREADY SENT
IT DOES LOOK VERY COOL
AND THEN DO WE GET TO MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
YEAH
YOU THINK BANANAS ARE A SAFE THING TO USE
IT'S A BIT UM PHALLIC
OH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
OH THAT'S JUST BAD
IS IT TO SCALE OR DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT A BIT SMALLER
YEAH
IT L DOES LOOK LIKE THE CURVY AND THEN THE WHOLE SHAPE'S CURVY SO I WOULD SAY THAT THIS CURVY DOES LOOK QUITE LIKE A VEGETABLE
I WASN'T VERY KEEN ON THAT BUT YEAH
SO WHERE'S THE VOLUME
AH YOU DID GET THAT IN THEN MM-HMM
OH OKAY
COOL
OH THE THING WE FORGOT WAS LIKE A MUTE BUTTON
YEAH
ON THE WHEEL LIKE IF YOU HOLD THE WHEEL DOWN THEN IT WILL MUTE
YEAH BUT IT'S A SCROLL AND CLICK ISN'T IT
OKAY COOL
SO THAT THAT SOLVES THE WHOLE MUTE ISSUE
YEAH
YEAH OH WE HOLD THE REMOTE
OH BUT IT IT DOES FEEL ALL COLD AND SLIMY
I HATE PLAY DO IT'S JUST MINGING
BUT YEAH UH THAT'S COOL COOL
MM-HMM
OKAY
WALES
MM
COOL OKAY
RIGHT OKAY
FABULOUS YEAH
OKAY COOL
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS PREFER PREPARE THE EVALUATION OF THE NEW DESIGN
UM SO WE'RE GONNA BE USING A SEVEN POINT SCALE SO ONE IS YOU KNOW YES
IT TOTALLY MEETS WITH THAT REQUIREMENT AND SEVEN IS NO IT REALLY DOESN'T WE NEED TO GO BACK AND START AGAIN
UM YOU KNOW
BASICALLY WHAT I DID WAS I WENT THROUGH ALL THE LIKE USER REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE AND WE'VE WORKED ON AND LIKE MADE A LIST OF THEM
UM YOU KNOW SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE EACH ONE AND LIKE SO IT WAS ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE START AND SAYING OH YEAH
WE DID MANAGE TO DO THAT OR OH NO WE REALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT
OKAY
COOL SO THESE ARE WHAT THEY ARE
OH
YES I DID HAVE A. B. C. AND D. DOWN HERE BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE TURNED INTO LIKE JUST BULLET POINTS
OKAY
BUT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THEY SAY A. B. C. AND D. THEN THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD
WELL I THOUGHT WE'D UM KINDA SAID THAT YOU'D HAVE A LITTLE THING TO STICK ON THE T. V.
YEAH
COOL
OKAY
SO BE ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT
THAT'S THIS ONE
WHAT DO YOU ALL SAY
YEAH
OH WE'RE ALL SO PROUD OF THE
OKAY SO THAT'LL BE A SEVEN FOR A.
COULD OH NO YOU CAN'T WHILST THAT'S UP THERE
OKAY UM UH WHAT I'VE DONE ON THE NEXT PAGE IS I'VE SET IT UP SO WE JUST PUT THE MARKS IN
YEAH
BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT
IF YOU TAKE A NOTE OF THEM AND THEN I'LL PUT THEM IN IN A MINUTE
OKAY SO WE'RE ALL AGREEING ON SEVEN FOR A.
COOL OKAY
DOES IT MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER
YEAH
I MEAN
YEAH
I TH I THINK IT'S NOT IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A PEN
YEAH BUT I MEAN BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A PEN YOU KNOW LEFT HANDED PEOPLE CAN'T NORMALLY WRITE RIGHT HANDED
BUT THEY CAN NORMALLY DO MOST THINGS RIGHT HANDED SO I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG ISSUE
YEAH
I MEAN YOU CAN YOU CAN USE YOUR FINGER TO TO SCROLL RATHER THAN YOUR THUMB
SO I MEAN THAT DOES KIND OF NEGATE THE WHOLE R. S. I. ISSUE
SO MAYBE WE NEED TO PUT THAT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF INVESTIGATION MAYBE GIVE IT A FIVE I WOULD SAY
WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
I TH I THINK THE ALTERNATIVE IS FLIPPING FROM THE TOP
YEAH UM
BUT YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT MAKING IT SMALLER YEAH
BECAUSE
SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT SIDE FLAT
SO IT WORKS LIKE A MOBILE PHONE FLIPPING BUT Y YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THAT SIDE'S FLAT THAN THAT WILL WORK
OKAY
UM OKAY SO C.
ARE ARE WE ADMITTING DEFEAT ON C. OR ARE WE SAYING WE'RE GONNA STICK A LOCATOR ON THE T. V.
THERE'S A LOCATOR
COOL SO THAT MEANS YOU NEED A THAT DOES MEAN YOU NEED A LITTLE SPEAKER ON IT THOUGH DOESN'T IT
TO MAKE IT BEEP
OR A BUZZER
OKAY
SO THAT'S TWO SO THAT'S SEVEN YEAH
IT'S LOCATABLE
FABULOUS
D.
YEAH
YEAH AND I MEAN D
SO SHOULD WE MAYBE SAY F A FIVE AND SAY IT IS INTUITIVE BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
SO DO YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S OBVIOUS HOW TO USE IT BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT FIRST
SO WE GIVE THAT ONE A FIVE YOU THINK
YEP
I'M GLAD YOU'RE ACCEPTING THIS
IT HAS TAKEN A LITTLE WHILE HASN'T IT
UM INTUITIVE
BUT
SORRY IT'S REALLY HARD TO WRITE ON THOSE
I JUST WENT A BIT MAD DIDN'T I
UM OKAY COOL E. OKAY
UM I WOULD GUESS THIS COMES BACK FROM THIS WHOLE B. THING LINKS IN HERE SO POSSIBLY FOR LEFT HANDED
INVESTIGATE
SO SHOULD WE GIVE IT A SIX
SIX
I USED TO SEND FIFTY TEXTS A DAY YOU KNOW AND I NEVER GOT REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY FROM THAT
SO I FIND IT QUITE HARD TO BELIEVE TO BE HONEST
OKAY SO WE GIVE THAT A SIX YEAH
OKAY F.
HANG ON HOW COME IT'S SHOWING UP WITH THE THINGS THERE BUT IT ONLY HAD BULLET POINTS THERE
THAT'S JUST
OH OKAY COOL
UM RIGHT SO
YES SO THAT'S A SEVEN THEN
UM COOL
YEAH BUT I MEAN YOU DON'T
THEY'RE NEVER BEEN USED I THEY'VE NEVER BEEN USING REMOTE REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE I DON'T THINK
YEAH WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK
SIX
WELL THAT'S IT I MEAN
YEAH BUT I MEAN EVERYTHING HAS BEEN USED IN SPACE BEFORE IT GETS TO ANYONE ELSE REALLY HASN'T IT
SO I DON'T THINK MANY PEOP
THAT'S IT THEY CAN TAKE IT WITH THEM
SO WE GIVE IT SEVEN AND WE WRITE
THERE WE GO
COOL
SO WE NEED THE AVERAGE HERE SO WE GOT
SEVEN
SO WE'VE GOT FOUR SEVENS SO THAT'S TWENTY EIGHT THREE SIXES EIGHTEEN
TWO THREE FOUR
SEVEN EIGHT
OKAY THAT'S PRETTY GOOD I THINK
UM NO THAT'S IT YEAH
COOL THERE WE GO
THERE WE GO AND THERE ARE THE MARKS
YEAH
YEAH BUT RUBBER COMES COLOURED DOESN'T IT
YOU KNOW
YEAH YOU MIGHT END UP HAVING TO TAKE OFF THE
SAMPLE SENSOR
NO
WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE PUSHBUTTON THOUGH HAVEN'T WE
'CAUSE THEN YOU HAVE
THAT MEANS YOU CAN ONLY HAVE TWENTY FIVE PUSH BUTTONS IN TOTAL DOESN'T IT
NOT COUNTING ANYTHING WE'D STILL BE IN BUDGET
TWELVE POINT FIVE
NO
WELL IT DOESN'T BUT IT UH
AND L. C. DISPLAY
THIS SAMPLE SENSOR
YEAH THE SAMPLE SENSOR WILL HAVE TO GO 'CAUSE THAT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE THING ON THERE
YEAH
BUT THAT'S A BIT OF A GIMMICK ANYWAY REALLY ISN'T IT
WE CAN AFFORD TO GET RID OF IT
SO THAT MEANS NO LOCATOR DOES IT
I MEAN DOES
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY YEAH
SEE I WAS GONNA SAY THE SCROLL WHEEL PUSHBUTTON THING 'CAUSE
BUT THAT'S WELL YOU WOULD JUST HAVE TO TO SPIN IT DOWN
SO THAT'S POINT THREE
YEAH I MEAN THAT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY COST ANY MORE
THAT'S THE SPIN WHEEL THOUGH ISN'T IT
DIDN'T THAT COME WITH THE L. C.
YEAH
YEAH
S SO WE'RE POINT THREE OVER
UNLESS WE JUST TAKE OFF THE SCROLL WHEEL ALTOGETHER AND JUST HAVE PUSHBUTTONS FOR THE VOLUME
COULD B STILL PUT THEM ON THE SIDE
BUT YEAH
I MEAN THE SCROLL WHEEL'S PRETTY COOL BUT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WELL WE COULD ADMIT TO THE SINGLE CURVE COULDN'T WE
YEAH BUT
YEAH
YEAH
NO
NO I DON'T THINK SO
YEAH
WE JUST GOT RID OF A GIMMICK THAT WAS NEVER ANYWAY
AND THE SCROLL WHEEL IS I MEAN ESSENTIALLY THE TWO BUTTONS THAT WAS IT'S NOT A GREAT DIFFERENCE I DON'T THINK
REALLY
COOL
THAT'S NOT A VERY EXCITING COLOUR
I THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE IT MORE VEGETABLE LIKE
OH THE THE BEEPER THING
IT
YEAH I THINK JEN WANTS IT TO VIBRATE
YOU KNOW YOUR PEN VIBRATES
YEAH
COOL
YEAH
IF WE'D HAD THAT SHEET AT THE BEGINNING SHOULD'VE BEEN LIKE OKAY
SO WE CAN HAVE THAT LOT LET'S JUST THROW IT TOGETHER AND DO WHAT WE CAN
YEAH
I THINK 'CAUSE THE MEETINGS WERE SO REGULAR YOU KNOW
IT WASN'T LIKE WE WERE ALONE FOR VERY LONG SO YOU DIDN'T ST GO OFF AND THINK
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT TO HAVE A VIBRATING REMOTE CONTROL SHAPED LIKE A BANANA
AND THEN YOU KNOW COME BACK THREE DAYS LATER AND JEN'S GOING LOOK LOOK IT VIBRATES AND IT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA
UM YEAH SO YEAH
UH I LIKE THE PENS
I WANT ONE
THAT WOULD JUST BE SO COOL TO D DO ALL YOUR NOTES AND S
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SAY THAT WAS THE RECORDING
OKAY COVER UP THE MICROPHONE
ALRIGHT LET'S TAKE IT
OKAY
IT IS A BIT LIMITING ISN'T IT
YEAH
YEAH
THE THING FLEW IN YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE WHOLE WHOOSHING THING 'CAUSE THERE WASN'T TIME FOR THAT SO YEAH
NOT THAT YOU CAN DO THAT ON THE BOARD EITHER
WE COULD MAKE SOME LITTLE
YEAH TOTALLY I MEAN THAT WAS FAIRLY TIGHT ANYWAY I MEAN ESPECIALLY WITH THAT LAST MINUTE ALTERATION
BACK IT THIS IS JUST HAD TO BE CHANGED
AND YEAH SO COOL
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT JEN NOW
YEAH DEFINITELY
YOU WEREN'T LIKE A A DICTATING LEADER SO THAT WAS ALWAYS GOOD
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE PEN YOU MIGHT ATTACK ME WITH IT
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T GO SHOPPING FOR REMOTE CONTROLS THAT OFTEN MAYBE SOMEBODY'S ALREADY THOUGH OF IT
YEAH
YEAH
I'LL BE LOOKING OUT NEXT TIME I NEED TO WRITE AN ESSAY
THAT LOOKS BORING I'LL SEE IF ANYONE'S MADE A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH YEAH
I THINK WE'D LIKE TO THINK THE IDEAS WERE NEW BUT WE'VE GOT NO WAY OF FINDING OUT
THAT VIBRATES
YEAH BUT THAT WOULD JUST COME UP WITH LIKE OTHER THINGS REALLY WOULDN'T IT
YES
AND IT'S FABULOUS
IT'S IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS
YEAH YEAH SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BIT RUSHED
YEAH WE'VE GOT LIKE FIVE MINUTES LEFT
YEAH
'KAY
WE COULD DRAW ANIMALS ON THE BOARD AGAIN
I DON'T LIKE PLAY DOH NO
IT'S JUST MINGING
IT SMELLS SO BAD
IT DOES
MM
NO IT HASN'T BEEN
DO WE HAVE TO GO BACK INTO THE OTHER ROOM OR CAN WE STAY IN HERE NOW
OKAY SO THE OTHER WAY
OKAY
THIS IS OUR FINAL MEETING THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
AND AGAIN I'LL TAKE MINUTES
THE WHAT WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH IN THIS MEETING IS FIRSTLY THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION FROM YOU TWO
SO YOU CAN SHOW US WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON SO DILIGENTLY
UM THEN
THEN CAT'S GOING TO PRESENT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE EVALUATING THIS AGAINST
THEN I NEED TO SAY SOME ST A FEW THINGS ABOUT FINANCE 'CAUSE WE HAVE TO CHECK THAT IT'S WITHIN THE FINANCE CRITERIA
UM AND THEN WE'LL BE MAKING SURE THAT OUR PRODUCT FITS BOTH THE EVALUATION CRITERIA FROM CAT AND THE FINANCIAL LIMITS
UM AND THEN WE UH WILL HAVE A BRIEF EVALUATION OF THE WHOLE PROCESS OF PRODUCTION AND DESIGN THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
SO WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES
S
'CAUSE WE MISSED OUT
SO
IT'S NOW I GUESS THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO START AT FIFTEEN THIRTY FIVE SO WE'VE GOT UNTIL FOUR
FIFTEEN
IS THAT RIGHT
YEAH UNTIL ABOUT FOUR FIFTEEN
SO YEAH
GO FOR IT
DO YOU WANT
YES
DUAL USE PERFECT
DUAL USE PERFECT
DOES IT VIBRATE WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS
SORRY SORRY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WOW
AND IT'S THE WHOLE THING'S MADE OF RUBBER IS THAT
MM-HMM
YEAH
HUH
MM-HMM
YEAH
SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
I LIKE THAT
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
Y OR YOU COULD HAVE IT SO YOU ON THE WHEEL IF YOU
BUT IF YOU HOLD IT IN IF IT'S A SCROLL AND CLICK SO YOU HOLD IT IN
NO
MM-HMM VERY GOOD
AND IT'S WITH THE THE BLACK AND YELLOW YOU'RE EVEN IN THE RIGHT COLOURS
MM-HMM
VERY GOOD LET'S HAVE A LOOK
TEST IT OUT
UH IT'S A SORT OF INTERMEDIATE COLOUR I GUESS
VERY GOOD
OKAY SO MAYBE IF WE GO ON TO EVALUATION CRI CRITERIA AND THEN WE'LL THERE I SUSPECT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A COUPLE OF MINOR FINANCE ISSUES
BUT UM WE'LL SE I'M SURE WE CAN GET AROUND THEM SOMEHOW
WE'LL JUST SEND ALL OF OUR MANUFACTURING TO
SOME NICE POOR COUNTRY AND
CUT SOME OF THE PRICES THAT WAY
WALES FOR EXAMPLE
MARKETING EXPERT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO FOR EACH OF THESE WE NEED TO GIVE IT A ONE TO SEVEN
IS THAT RIGHT
MM DOTS NEVER MIND
YEAH I AGREE
YEAH JUST PREPARE ONE NOW
I RECKON IT
YEAH
SEVEN YEAH IT'S TERRIBLY SEXY
YEAH
AH OKAY
EXCELLENT
EXCEPT WE CAN'T UH WE CAN IF WE THEN YEAH I'LL TAKE A NOTE IT'S FINE
YEAH
I THINK IT DOES
ALRIGHT
BUT THAT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM 'CAUSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE ALL LEFT HANDERS OR ALL RIGHT HANDERS IN A FAMILY
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM
SIX
YEAH I THINK I THINK FOR UM I MEAN MOST PEOPLE ARE RIGHT HANDED SO IN IN TERMS OF OUR GREATEST TARGET GROUP
I THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO FLAG IT FOR MANAGEMENT THEY WANT MIGHT WANT TO UM
THEY
MM-HMM
YEAH
THE LENGTH IS GONNA BE DIFFICU
MM
NO WE'RE GONNA PUT IT LIKE WE'VE GOT TH THERE'S THE LOCATOR DOT
MM
YEAH
YEAH
I'D SAY SIX 'CAUSE THE I MEAN THE THE STANDARD LAYOUT FOR NUMBERS IS THREE THREE THREE AND ONE RATHER THAN THE WAY YOU'VE GOT IT
I REALLY LIKE THE WAY YOU HAVE IT BUT IT'S NOT THE IMMEDIATE THING THAT YOU'RE USED TO
SO
MIGHT BE
BUT IT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL BE EXPERIENCING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES SOON
FIVE
YEAH
I'M HAPPY WITH FIVE
YEAH
YEP
BUT OTHERWISE IT'S SUPERB
SIX
YEAH
WELL WE'VE BANNED THEM FROM
YEAH
YEAH IT'S VARIED
YEAH
SIX
VOICE CONTROL HAVE SEVEN
AH THAT'S THE SECOND ONE
SO YOU MUST HAVE CHANGED IT ON THIS ONE WHERE IT'S GOT SCORE BUT NOT ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE
G. TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL TECHNOLOGY NONE OF IT IS ACTUALLY NEW
YEAH
ALL OF THE COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN USED IN OTHER THINGS BEFORE
BUT DO YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WHAT DO YOU RECKON FIVE SIX
YEAH
SPACE REMOTE
PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
VERY GOOD
YEAH ONE
OR A SEVEN
FIFTY ONE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT
SIX POINT POINT ABOUT SIX POINT FIVE
CLOSE ENOUGH
NOW WAIT UNTIL WE GET TO FINANCE AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN AFFORD IT
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT OR DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING MORE
THAT'S IT
ALRIGHT
SO FINANCE
AND WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN
UNSCREW THIS FIRST
SORRY THIS IS I'M JUST UM
BEAUTIFUL
NOT ANYMORE
COMPUTER NO SIGNAL
ADJUSTING
THERE WE GO
OKAY SO WE'VE LOOKED AT THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION AND THE EVALUATION CRITERIA
AND NOW WE HAVE TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COSTS
SO I'VE GOT AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET TO HELP US DO THAT
CAN YOU READ THAT
ALMOST
MORE OR LESS
UM I STARTED FILLING IT IN BUT OF COURSE THESE ARE PROVISIONAL SO WE HAVE TO GO DOWN
NO HAND DYNAMO RIGHT
ONE SIMPLE BATTERY
NO KINETIC ENERGY NO SOLAR
THE CHIP WE'RE GOING FOR AN ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
WE ALSO SAID THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER
UM SINGLE CURVED SURFACE SO THAT WE CAN FOLD IT
CASE MATERIAL WE SAID RUBBER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SPECIAL COLOUR MEANS
IT COULD BE
RUB RUBBER COMES COLOURED IT'S I WOULD MAYBE IT'S LIKE IF YOU WANT TITANIUM COLOURED OR WOOD COLOURED IT'S DIFFERENT
YEAH LET'S LEAVE IT AS ZERO 'CAUSE IT'S EASY
WE WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE TO SO WE'VE GOT PUSHBUTTON AND THEN WE'VE
SCROLL WHEEL WITH PUSHBUTTON WE HAD NO
S FOR THE MUTING
YEAH
AND BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
NO
NO
BUT THE THE SPINNING WHEEL'S NOT THERE
I HAVE THINK MAYBE IT'S INTEGRATED WITH THE L. C. DISPLAY
I THINK THE PUSHBUTTON OH
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ONE
YEAH
THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY
PUSH WHAT UH WHETHER WHETHER PUSHBUTTON MEANS THAT P COUNT BY BUTTON OR DO WE I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES SENSE
NO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO AS WE CAN SEE THAT'S WAY TOO EXPENSIVE DOWN HERE
OUR BUDGET'S TWELVE POINT FIVE
YEAH SO THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS THOUGH FOR THE
FOR THE LOCATOR
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT ELSE DOES IT NEED
YEAH 'CAUSE THE SAMPLE SPEAKER WAS I THINK MORE COMPLICATED THEN JUST A BEEPING THING
YEAH OKAY SO WE
UH-HUH
RIGHT SO WE NEED ONE FIFTY OFF
TAKE IT DOWN TO JUST A SCROLL WHEEL
WE COULD DO
YEAH
YOU CAN HAVE TO SCROLL IT STRAIGHT R ROLL IT STRAIGHT DOWN FOR FOR MUTE
THAT'S WITH THE L. C.
WE DECIDED 'CAUSE IT'S NOT ON OUR LIST
THE SCROLL WHEEL IS ON THE SIDE
WE'RE POINT THREE OVER AT THE MOMENT
IT'S NOTHING N
YEAH I HAVE
YEAH
RATHER THAN HAVING THREE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO DO
THERE WE GO
OH LOOK WE'RE WAY UNDER BUDGET AND WE'LL MAKE HUGE PROFITS AND WE'LL ALL GET BONUSES
OR OR THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SPECIAL COLOUR
SO THAT'S ALRIGHT
WE WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THEN I'LL TAKE I CAN SEND IT BACK TO MANAGEMENT AND SAY WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE ABOUT THE COLOUR
IF THAT COSTS EXTRA THEN WE'VE STILL GOT SOME SPACE FOR IT YEAH
EXCELLENT
ALRIGHT
SO DID WE LOSE UM ON OUR EVALUATION CRITERIA AS A RESULT OF DOING THAT
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT THEN
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BEEP
YEAH
YEAH
THA
'CAUSE WE WE WON'T HAVE RUN OUT OF OUR POT OF PLAY DOH
YEAH I KNOW I KNOW MY PEN VIBRATES
BUT ONLY FOR A VERY SHORT TIME
UM
OKAY
SO
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE DESIGNED A
BANANA
WELL DONE TEAM
UM WE NEED WE'VE JUST GOT ABOUT TEN MINUTES OR SO LEFT OF THE MEETING
SO IT WOULD BE GOOD IF WE COULD JUST HAVE A LITTLE TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT ITSELF AND HOW IT WENT
UM SO THAT WE CAN FEED BACK TO THE MANAGEMENT FOR NEXT TIME THEY'RE DESIGNING A PRODUCT
FEEDBACK
IDEAS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS OF UM GOING AND WORKING INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN COMING BACK TO A MEETING THAT THAT WORKED IN TERMS OF
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BANANA
MM-HMM THE WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS
WE LIKE THE PENS
YEAH YOU COULD TAKE IT TO LECTURES AND JUST WRITE STUFF DOWN AND HAVE IT PRINTED OUT WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO THE OFFICE
THEY GREAT
DO YOU THINK THEY'D NOTICE IF ONE WENT
OH OKAY
YEP
SHH
YEP
BUT THAT WORKED WELL HAVING HAVING A WHITEBOARD THAT WE COULD DRAW ON AS WELL AS HAVING THE POWERPOINT
'CAUSE THE I FIND THAT THE PROBLEM WITH POWERPOINT OFTEN IS THAT IT'S SO STATIC AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT ONCE YOU'RE IN THERE YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT'S ALRIGHT THAT ALWAYS IRRITATES ME ANYWAY YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
AND PRESUMABLY YOU DON'T YOU CAN SAY NASTY THINGS AS WELL
I HAVE NO STAKE IN IT
YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT 'CAUSE I'M TAKING THE NOTES
I'LL LEAVE THE ROOM AND YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER GO
BETTER THAN THAT THAN THE BANANA
I THINK IT WORKED QUITE WELL
DID ANYONE FEEL THAT THEY WERE GETTING SORT OF COVERED UP AND NOT BEING ABLE TO
SAY THEIR BIT
YEAH
NEW IDEAS FOUND
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT ABOUT
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
BANANA REMOTE
YEAH
OR YOU CAN ALWAYS GO TO GOOGLE AND TYPE IN BANANA REMOTE CONTROL
FLIP
VIBRATE
AND UH YEAH
NOTHING THAT YOU REALLY WANT
TRUE
YEAH
OKAY
SO COSTS ARE WITHIN BUDGET WELL WITHIN BUDGET INCLUDING A LITTLE WHAT HAVE WE GOT
ONE EURO LEFT OVER FOR BITS THAT WE DIDN'T FORESEE
UM WE'VE EVALUATED
THE PROJECT
YOU'VE GOT THE SCORES
CAN YOU PUT THAT IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FILE
IT'S IN THERE ALREADY
AND THE PROCESS WHEEL DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH
WERE THERE ANY WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU FOUND DIFFICULT OR ANYTHING
THAT DIDN'T GO AS SMOOTHLY AS YOU'D HOPE
YEAH
OKAY THEN
UM I THINK WE'RE STILL WELL WITHIN OUR
TIME
WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LEFT BUT IF WE'VE FINISHED THEN WE'VE FINISHED
WE'RE JUST TOO TOO EFFICIENT AND YOU SHOULD NEVER DRAG A MEETING ON JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE EXTRA TIME
SO I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE END OF THAT MEETING
THANK YOU TEAM
IT WAS VERY PRODUCTIVE DAY AND
MM UH NO
RIGHT SO WE HAVE TO COMPLETE THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY WHEN THEY SEND IT
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ALREADY SENT OR NOT
UM PRESUMABLY I HAVE TO
I DON'T SEE WHY YOU CAN'T STAY HERE REALLY
DID I SAVE THIS ONE
PRODUCTION COSTS
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PINK
BUT IT WAS BLUE ON THE BOARD
YEAH
YEAH ABOUT FOUR FIFTEEN YEAH
SO YOU SAID UM ARE ARE WE STARTING WITH THE THE SO WILL YOU MAYBE START WITH LIKE THE MM THE SHAPE AND THINGS AND AND THEN I WILL EXPLAIN THE THE USER INTERFACE TH UH THINGS
LIKE THE BUTTONS AND THE SCROLLING THINGS AND
WELL BUT IT'S IT'S JUST AN A APPROXIMATION
UH YEAH
RUBBER
YEAH
UM IT COULD BE MADE A BIT SMALLER AND AND OF COURSE IT WOULD BE AND YEAH
BUT UM ONE THING WE ACTUALLY KIND OF UM FORGOT WHILE DESIGNING
THAT ONE SIDE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ROUNDER SO WE SAID THE BACK SIDE ROUND YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND IT'S SPONGY AS WELL
SO SO UH THE USER INTERFACE AS AS WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME UH MM ON ON THE ON THE COVER WE JUST HAVE THE VERY BASIC THINGS
SO WE HAVE THAT N UH CHANNELS HERE STARTING FROM UM UH ONE TWO THREE THERE WOULD BE NUMBERS IN IN THE ON THE ACTUAL ONE
SO IT'S FOUR UP TO FOUR UP TO SEVEN UP TO NINE AND ZERO Z ZERO HERE
YEAH
AND THEN WELL THIS IS ON OFF BUTTON
IT'S IT'S QUITE STANDARD MM PLACE FOR IT AND AND ALSO THE COLOUR IS QUITE OFTEN RED SO IT'S IT'S KIND OF USER FRIENDLY
AND THEN THESE ONES WOULD BE FOR FLIPPING THE CHANNELS BACK AND LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONE AND THE NEXT ONE
AND AND WE WOULD ALSO HAVE A L LITTLE UM THING SAYING HERE PREVIOUS AND NE PREVON PREVON NEXT
THE VOLUME IS IS SCROLLING
ON THE SIDE THIS ONE
YEAH YOU JUST DO IT LIKE THIS
AND AND AND IT'S IT'S ON THE BACK IS MM COVER OR BACK LID BECAUSE IF YOU FLIP IT OPEN YOU CAN STILL DO THE SCROLLING HERE
SEE
SO THE VOLUME IS YOU JUST SCROLL BUT THEN ONCE YOU FLIP IT OPEN OKAY
THERE THERE YOU HAVE THE SCREEN AND AND YOU HAVE THE MM SPINNING WHEEL WITH OPTIONS TO CHOOSE
YOU CAN MOVE BACK AND FORTH AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO M CHOOSE SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN YOU JUST PUSH THE CEN MM THE MIDDLE BUTTON
A MUTE BUTTON
WELL WE'LL HAVE THIS ON THE SCREEN ON THE DISPLAY
WELL BUT THE BUT THE MUTE YEAH THE SCROLLING IS KIND OF YOU HAVE TO SCROLL ALL THE WAY TO MAKE IT MUTE RIGHT
OKAY YEAH OKAY
YEAH
AND OKAY SO I SO THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS ALSO JUST PART OF IT
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT IN THE INTERFACE
YEAH
AND WE DO HAVE THE LOGO ON IT AS WELL
SO I THINK IT
YEAH
YEAH I THINK UM WE COULD DO L THE LOGO IN GREY AS IT IS ON THE WEBSITE
IN THE ACTUAL ONE
YEAH
SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
YEAH
YEAH THE YEAH IT'S DEFINITELY ATTRACTIVE
OH THE LOCATABLE THING WE ACTUALLY FORGOT
YEAH
SHALL I JUST PREPARE IT NOW
IT WILL BE RED TOO
S SEVEN WAS TH THE MAXIMUM YEAH
I I GO FOR SEVEN
I WOULD THINK YES YEAH
YEAH SO Y SO WE WE MIGHT DO WE MIGHT WANT TO DO LIKE A UH ANOTHER M MODEL ANOTHER ANOTHER VERSION
WHICH IS LIKE EXACTLY THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THIS ONE
YEAH
BUT THEN THEN I THINK LEFT HANDED PEOPLE ARE ALREADY USED TO DISCRIMINATION ANYWAY SO THEY JUST
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE I MEAN ANYWAY RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO SCROLL WITH IT SO I IF THE MAJORITY ARE RIGHT HANDED IT'S UH
OR MAYBE SIX BECAUSE IT'S JUST ONE ONE I ONE AMONG THE ISSUES I MEAN
YEAH
YEAH
NO YEAH BUT MM BUT WE HAVE IT NICELY WITH THE HINGES HERE YEAH
SO IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM IT WILL BE AND IT WILL BE IT WON'T BE HEAVY
YEAH WELL YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S A BIT LONG
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LONG
WELL I MEAN IT CAN BE OPENED LIKE THIS OF COURSE AND YEAH
S UH SLIGHTLY SMALLER
YEAH BUT IF WE FLIP IT OPEN ONLY AS MUCH AS THAT
MM THAT YOU STICK ON T. V.
YEAH WELL W BUT L BUT THE SPEAK SAMPLE SPEAKER IS INCLUDED
SO IT IT HAS SOME CAPACITY TO MM TO DO SOME TO MAKE SOME SOUNDS SO YEAH
YEP
YEAH
IF UH UH IF THIS MEANS INTUITIVE IF IT MEANS THE WAY PEOPLE KIND OF ARE USED TO FINDING THINGS AND IT'S I TH I THINK IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
UM UH THE ERGONOM ERGONOMIC DESIGN WELL MM I MEAN I D UH I DUNNO I MEAN THE THE REPETITIVE STRESS THINGS
BUT THEN WHO WOULD BE REALLY PUSHING THE BUTTONS SO MUCH ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL ANYWAY YEAH
SEE
YEAH SO IT'S KINDA
YEAH
YEAH IT DOES HAVE YEAH
TECHNOLOGI WELL
YEAH
WELL MM WE HAVE WE HAVE THE SAMPLE SPEAKER AS WELL WHICH IS YEAH IT'S KIND OF NEW
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE ALL THEY ARE ALL RELATIVELY NEW
SIX
I MEAN HOW HOW FAR CAN YOU GO WITH A REMOTE CONTROL REALLY
IT STILL HAS TO DO WHAT I WHAT IT HAS TO DO
YEAH ISN'T IT FASHIONABLE
YEAH SURE
IT'S THE MAXIMUM FASHION
FRUIT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE FASHIONABLE THESE DAYS SO
SO I THINK WE'VE DONE VERY WELL BUT
WHAT'S THE ASSESSMENT
THE AVERAGE IS ABOUT SIX AND SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT OVER SIX
NO WAIT A LITTLE BIT UNDER SIX
NO WAIT
OH THREE SIXES OKAY YEAH
FOUR SEVENS
SIX POINT SOMETHING YEAH
SIX POINT FIVE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH YES
RUBBER
I THINK SOMETHING COLOURED YEAH PROBABLY
SO I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY SPECIAL CO NO
YEAH
OR MAYBE MAYBE IF YOU WANT SOME KIND OF PATTERN THING ON IT YEAH YEAH OKAY
YEAH
WE HAVE PUSHBUTTONS
SCRO WE HAVE SCROLL WHEEL AS WELL
S YEAH YEAH WE HAD FOR MUTING YEAH
AND WE HAVE L. C. DISPLAY AND YEAH
UM
YEAH BUT WHAT DO WE HA WE HAVE L. C. DISPLAY BUT BUT THE WH BUT THE S SPINNING WHEEL
YEAH
OKAY LET'S YEAH
WE HAVE TO COUNT ALL OF THEM OR YEAH
BUT IT WAS VERY NO INNOVATIVE INNOVATIVENESS
WELL UM YEAH
WELL THE SPEAKER UH THE SAMPLE SPEAKER IS IS EXPENSIVE BUT WE COULD JUST HAVE SOME SOME VERY VERY EASY DEVICE THAT JUST BEEPS
THIS WOULD BE
YEAH YEAH YEAH THERE YOU RECORD YOUR SAMPLES YOUR SPEECH SAMPLES AND
YEAH THEN THEN WE WOULD BE IN THE B BUDGET
YEAH B NO NO YOU CAN PUSH THIS ONE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A PUSHBUTTON UH WE CA WE DON'T HAVE THIS MUTING MECHANISM FOR THIS SCROLLING THING
MM-HMM
BUT I MEAN WE CAN PUT AN ADDITIONAL MUTE BUTTON ON THE TOP AS WELL
IF YOU
MM
SO
MM-HMM
OKAY YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
WELL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BEEPING THING
BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE SAMPLE SPEAKER BUT IT WILL JUST BEEP SO WE STILL HAVE THE LOCATE
WHICH COLOUR THE THE COLOUR OF THE PHONE OR THE COLOUR OF THE
BUT IT CAN BE YELLOW AS WELL
IT CAN COME IN THE SAME COLOUR AS THE THE CASE
YEAH MM AS FAR AS CREATIVITY IS CONCERNED YEAH I THINK THERE WAS THERE WAS ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
THE ONLY THE ONLY PROBLEM BEING THAT AT THE END WE HAD TO CUT SOME THINGS DOWN BECAUSE OF THE THE BUDGET WE HAD
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THE M THE MEANS WERE VERY VERY GOOD THE MEANS WE USED
AND THE PENS
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND AND AND THIS TIME ALSO THE TIME LIMITS BUT ACTUALLY PREPARING THE
YEAH
BUT YEAH BUT I MEAN ALREADY JUST JUST PREPARING THE SLIDES BEFORE BEFORE THE MEETING YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I WAS I WAS SATISFIED WITH WITH THE LEADERSHIP YEAH
MM-HMM
AND THEN THE TEAMWORK I THINK I THINK IT WORKED QUITE QUITE NICELY YEAH
TO EXPRESS THEM MM MM NO
WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S PRETTY NEW PRETTY NOVEL SOLUTION FOR A FOR A REMOTE CONTROL REALLY ALL THIS FLIPPING OPEN THING AND
YEAH NEITHER NEITHER DO I BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING AND AND NONE OF MY EXAMPLES WERE WAS WAS LIKE THIS ACTUALLY SO
YEAH MAYBE W MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A PATENT ON THIS ONE
PATENT PATENT PATENT
MM
MM-HMM
YES
YES
AND MY MAIN DIFFICULTY WAS THE THE TIME PRESSURE
OTHERWISE IT'S IT'S ALL FINE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YES
YEAH IT WAS A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU

I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT BUT LET'S JUST START IT OFF AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU'RE ALL READY
SO IS THE AGENDA
OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING AND PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND THEN CLOSING
PROJECT AIM IS A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S ORIGINAL UH TRENDY AND IT'S USER FRIENDLY
PROJECT METHOD FUNCTIONAL DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK ANOTHER MEETING CONCEPTUAL DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK AND A MEETING OF DETAILS DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK AND A MEETING
TOOL TRAINING
TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD EVERY PARTICIPANT SHOULD DRAW THEIR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND SUM UP THEIR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
UM
UH MISS INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST
YEAH WHY DON'T YOU JUST C I THINK JUST CLIP ON CLIP DO YOU HAVE A BELT
OR PUT 'EM IN YOUR POCKET YEAH
YEAH WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL
IS IT RUDE
THAT'S A VERY GOOD ELEPHANT
'KAY AND YOU WANT TO WRITE UP ON THERE IT SAYS YOU'VE GOTTA SUM UP YOUR F F YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
MM
OKAY
WONDERFUL WELL DONE
DO YOU WANT TO USE THE WIPE THE M THE WIPER AND WIPE IT OFF
AND MISTER AESTHETICS DESIGNER DO YOU WANNA GO NEXT
NO
NO
OKAY WELL DONE
YEAH
MISS MAR MISS MARKETING
UM YEAH I THINK YOU CAN JUST DRAW THE FACE BUT THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO DESCRIBE IN WRITING HOW THE REST OF IT LOOKS
THAT'S A VERY PR PRETTY CAT
OKAY DO Y DO YOU WANNA DO SOME WRITE YOU WANNA JUST WRITE SOME WORDS ABOUT IT
WOW SO THEY'RE KINDA SPIRITUAL
WELL DONE
OKAY
UM I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT FOR THE FOR TH FOR THIS MEETING I'LL S DRAW A LITTLE

NO NO UH
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
UH NOT A VERY GOOD ONE
OKAY WELL YOU GOT IT'S A S
IT'S A SQUIRREL AND I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE CUTE
AND STUPID
RIGHT
OKAY SO I GUESS THAT WAS THE TEST TO SEE IF THIS EQUIPMENT IS ALL WORKING
MM
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PAGE
OKAY PROJECT FINANCE SELLING PRICE TWENTY FIVE EUROS PROFIT AIM FIFTY MILLION EUROS
YEAH
PRODUCTION COST AH RIGHT IT'S GOTTA BE CAN'T COST ANY MORE THAN TWELVE FIFTY TO MAKE
EXPERIENCE WITH WITH REMOTE CONTROL SO TALK ABOUT WHO WHO'S USED WHAT
ANY IDEAS
STUFF LIKE THAT
NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES
AT QUARTER TO TWELVE
YEAH
OH K SO WE'RE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS DISCUSSION LIKE RIGHT NOW ARE WE OR OH OKAY
I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST T GIVING US INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE RE TO DO NEXT BUT
OKAY
RIGHT WHO'S GOT EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THEN
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY
UM
'KAY UM
W WHAT
YOU WANT IT BIG DO YOU WANT IT SMALL
ARE WE ARE WE GOING FOR LIKE LIKE TELEPHONES ARE GOING LITTLE TEENY TINY THINGS OR WE ARE GOING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S BIG AND
VIDEO AND TS HI FI AND STUFF
MAYBE YOU YEAH NOW TH THAT'S THE OTHER THING IS IT'S GOTTA BE CHEAP
'CAUSE I I I MEAN I WAS THINKING SOMETHING THAT'S GOT DIFFERENT LIKE MAYBE A A AN L. C. D. DISPLAY ON IT THAT'S GOT DIFFERENT PAGES FOR DIFFERENT DEVICES
BUT THAT WOULD P THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE QUITE EXPENSIVE
PER UNIT YEAH
WELL AT THE MOMENT WE COULD
WA I MEAN WE 'CAUSE WE THIS IS WHAT WE TH WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT IS JUST SAYING WHAT WHAT WE'D LIKE
AND THEN AFTER WE AFTER WE'VE FOUND OUT WHAT WE CAN LIKE
SOME DIFFERENT IDEAS WE CAN THEN GO AND DO THE RESEARCH TO FIND OUT IF THESE ANY OF THESE IDEAS ARE FEASIBLE OR NOT
SO WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT THAT CONTROLS LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
UM
'KAY
OKAY THAT'S
TH THAT'S AN IDEA
OKAY
ONE SIDE FOR KIDS ONE SIDE FOR ADULTS
LIKE IT OR SOMETHING LIKE A FLIP TELEPHONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAYBE
F FLIP IT OPEN AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THE BUTTONS OR YOU FLIP IT CLOSED AND YOU'VE JUST GOT THE BASIC BUTTONS ON THE OUTSIDE MAYBE
UM OH WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES LEFT
BUT OKAY
WELL WE'VE GOT A K WE'VE GOT A FEW IDEAS THERE
YEAH
I HAVE GOT I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE A BACK UP PLAN OF I 'CAUSE I I I JUST THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT I MEAN WE DON'T
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTROL EVERYTHING
WE SHOULD HAVE A BACK UP PLAN OF JUST A REALLY GOOD TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
THAT JUST THAT IS JUST FOR A T. V. BUT IT'S JUST A REALLY GOOD NICE ONE
WHAT DO YOU RECKON
SEE 'CAUSE I'M JUST THINKING BEARING IN MIND TH WE'VE GOTTA WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S CHEAP TO MAKE
I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH IDEAS AND STUFF A LOT QUICKER
YEAH
MAY W YOU KNOW MAYBE EVEN
OR MAYBE EVEN SO SOMETHING THAT'S FOR DISABLED PEOPLE OR SO PEOPLE THAT UH B DON'T SEE VERY WELL OR BIG BUTTONS FOR TOUCHY BUTTONS FOR
YEAH
OR JUST ONE THAT LOOKS REALLY FUCKING COOL
OTHERWISE WE'LL BE WE'LL BE HERE ALL DAY TALKING ABOUT DO THIS LET'S DO THAT N I THINK WE SH I THINK WE SHOULD
YEAH
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE WE'RE UH YOU KNOW UH SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE ALL A BIT SORT OF GADGET HEADS AND WE LIKE THINGS THAT DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE
BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
I MEAN I'D LIKE ONE THAT MAKES TEA AS WELL BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN
OKAY LIKE A LOCK F LIKE A LOCK FUNCTS FUNCTION ON IT LIKE YOU HAVE ON YOUR TELEPHONES YEAH
YEAH IT'S GOTTA BE SELLABLE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
NO PORN CHANNEL FOR CHILDREN
OKAY
UM ALRIGHT SO WE'VE GOT SOME IDEAS WE'VE GOT UM
LET'S MOVE ON
OOPS LET'S CLOSE THAT
NEXT MEETING UH OKAY
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UM WHICH IS
UM
YEAH THERE YOU GO
SO
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S YOU SO YOU GOTTA YOU GO YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONE THAT'S WORKING OUT WHAT WHAT BUTTONS WE NEED
UM
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER YOU ARE THE ONE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING OUT KIND OF BOX IT GOES IN I GUESS SO UM
WHETHER IT'S WHAT GOES INTO THE BOX SOMEHOW
AND IN MARKETING
USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATIONS
YEAH WHAT
RIGHT OKAY YEAH
YOU TWO YOU TWO ARE GONNA BE JUST I THINK YOU JUST DOUBLE UP YOU KNOW YOU WORKING TOGETHER
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOTTA GO AND FIND OUT DO TH DO THE RESEARCH
SEE WHAT PEOPLE WANT IN A REMOTE WHAT BUTTONS ARE USED MORE OFTEN AND S STUFF LIKE THAT
OH WE'VE BEEN WARNED TO FINISH THE MEETING NOW
OKAY
OKAY EVERYONE WELL DONE
GOOD MEETING
YEAH
SO WE'RE 'KAY
ON THE OR
NO
I DUNNO WHERE TO PUT IT 'CAUSE THE
OKAY
COULD YOU S TAKE IT OFF
OKAY
ARE WE FREE TO TAKE NOTES UH
OKAY
OKAY
SO ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BRING THE LITTLE THINGS FOR THE
MM
YEAH
OKAY
SO MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
'KAY UM
UM OKAY IT'S BIG IT'S GOT A GREAT MEMORY
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A GREAT MEMORY WE SAY AN ELEPHANT NEVER FORGETS
AND UH DUNNO KNOW WHY BUT LOOKS LIKE NICE TO ME
NICE ANIMAL
OKAY
NO
REALLY
OH THAT'S A
NOT BAD I WOULD SAY
VERY GOOD
MM
YEAH
IS THIS A T. V. ONE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE
OKAY
T
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH UH I MEAN HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE PER HOW MUCH
TWELVE FIFTY
SO DO WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC WITHIN THE BUDGET OR
CLOSE PR I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
UM HAVE UH ONE VERY COMPLICATED ONE ON ONE SIDE WITH ALL THE D. V. D. AND V. C. R. ACCESS AND STUFF
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE O ONE UH A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY SIMPLE WITH JUST THE CHANNEL
PROGRAM PLUS AND MINUS AND THE JUST THE MUTE BUTTON FOR EXAMPLE
I CAN REAL KEEP IT REALLY REALLY SIMPLE ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER SIDE BE VERY COMPLICATED
YEAH
OR GRANDMA AS WELL YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE WHAT IS THE MUTE BUTTON
NO BUT YOU WOULD SLIDE IT INTO UH SOMETH LIKE SOMETHING ON THE BACK WOULD HOLD LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PRESS THE BUTTONS BUT
START BREAKING UP
YEAH
YEAH
COULD BE REALLY LIGHT OR I DUNNO SOMETHING SPECIAL
YEAH 'CAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF IT SAYS JUST T. V. REMOTE DOESN'T SAY COM COMBINATION WITH ALL ALL THE R
MM
OKAY
THAT'S
MM
MM
HAR HOW IT WORKS AN
BU
DO YOU THINK OUR TWO KIND OF OVERLAP BECAUSE
YEAH
I DON'T
YEAH
THE BACK END OF AN ELEPHANT
AESTHETIC YEP SURE
'KAY MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL UH LET'S SEE
DUNNO IF ANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN NAPOLEON DYNAMITE BEFORE
IT'S A LIGER A COMBINATION OF A LION AND TIGER
HAVE YOU NOT SEEN NAPOLEON DYNAMITE
OH IT'S A HILARIOUS MOVIE
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT
AND
AND IT'S BEST CHARACTERISTIC IS IT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE AWESOMEST
ANIMAL
BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE TO FULLY APPRECIATE IT
THERE GO
A PRAIRIE DOG
OH A SQUIRREL
YEAH THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
ALRIGHT
SO I THINK BEFORE WE CLOSE UH WE ARE EXPECTED I MEAN THE LAST SLIDE WANTED US TO MAYBE DISCUSS LONGER WHAT OUR
WHAT OUR IDEAS WHERE
I MEAN IF YOU WANNA GO BACK TO THE LAST SLIDE
UH
S
YEAH I THINK WE'RE I MEAN BEFORE WE CLOSE THE MEETING WE'RE SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS FOR
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THIS IS JUST THE PRELIMINARY GET SOME ROUGH IDEAS FOR WHAT OUR EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS HAVE BEEN AND AND WHAT WE WOULD
ROUGHLY WHAT WE WOULD INCORPORATE INTO A NEW ONE MAYBE
YEAH I THINK WE'VE ALL GOT
MM
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S LIKE THERE'S SORT OF A TENSION BETWEEN TWO IDEAS I MEAN
YOU WANT YOU WANT ONE REMOTE THAT MAYBE CAN WORK UH ALL ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS OF T. V. AND IF YOU HAVE WHATEVER ASSOCIATED WITH T. V. THE D. V. D. PLAYER
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT LIKE AT THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T WANNA REALLY BUSY REMOTE WITH A THOUSAND BUTTONS ON IT OR SOMETHING
MM
YEAH
IT G CAN'T BE MORE THAN TWELVE FIFTY PER UNIT
COST
YEAH
YEAH
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S LIKE
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A TWO SIDED REMOTE THOUGH
'CAUSE IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO USE IN THE WAY THAT YOU MANI MANIPULATE IT
OH
OH OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH WE SHOULD UH I GUESS BY THE END OF THIS MEETING WE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST A A ROUGH CONCEPTION YOU KNOW STAGE ONE WAS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
WHAT EFFECT THE APPARATUS SHOULD HAVE
OKAY
UM SO I MEAN WE STILL HAVE TIME IN OUR NEXT MEETING TO COME UP WITH THE ACTUAL CONCEPT FOR THE USER INTERFACE
BUT THE THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE'RE SURE THAT WE WANT ARE THAT IT CAN CONTROL THE T. V.
BUT ALSO DEVICES CONNECTED TO THE TO THE T. V. I MEAN BE ABLE TO OPERATE
D. V. D. PLAYERS THINGS LIKE THAT
YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH I MEAN
YEAH THAT'S TRUE MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CONCENTRATE ON HAVING A A GOOD T. V. REMOTE AND HAVE IT BE UM
HAVE IT BE LIKE ERGONOMIC SO IT'S COMFORTABLE TO USE UH SIMPLE TO USE AND LOOKS DECENT AND
SORTA FIND A NICHE FOR OUR REMOTE LIKE MARKET IT TO A CERTAIN KIND OF P KIND OF PEOPLE
CERTAIN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC
YEAH NO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
YEAH RATHE RATHER THAN FOCUS ON
Y
YEAH
YEAH
REMOTES SPINNING OUT FROM OTHER REMOTES AND HAVING LITTLE NESTED REMOTES INSIDE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A FLIP FUNCTION IT CAN JUST HAVE A LOCK FUNCTION
SO THAT IT'S NOT UH NOT USABLE WHEN YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE USABLE
I GUESS THAT'S GOOD GOOD FOR NOW
THAT'S ME
OKAY
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH IT DOES SEEM LIKE OUR OUR RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE SOME OVERLAP
YEAH
ALRIGHT SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
IS THAT ALRIGHT
OR
OKAY
KEEPS COMING OFF
'S FIDDLY
RIGHT
OH ANOTHER ONE
AH
VERY NICE
'KAY
OKAY
CLIP
AH
IT'S AN ELEPHANT
OH MY GOSH I'M NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO DRAW THAT WELL
DOES IT
OH
MM
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS
OH
IT'S
A WHAT
ALRIGHT
HOW
NO
GREAT
ME
OKAY
NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS IS GONNA WORK
COOL
UH WELL I'LL TRY MY BEST TO DRAW
CAN I JUST DRAW THE FACE
OOH
IT'S A CAT
WHICH ALSO HAS WHAT
A BIG FAT BODY AND
BIG AND A LONG TAIL
WHY
BECAUSE UM CUDDLY
AND USUALLY CATS ARE VERY FRIENDLY
USUALLY
AND THEY'RE HEALING AS WELL
THEY HEAL
AND THEY CAN FEEL WHEN A HUMAN'S GOT PROBLEMS SO
SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE CATS
THERE WE ARE THAT'S ME
MM
MM-HMM
AH
MARKET RANGE INTERNATIONALLY SOLD
AH RIGHT OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
UH
YEAH
YEAH IT'S A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL
WELL
A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR T. V.
WHAT WOULD I LIKE
UM
MEDIUM
MM
TWELVE FIFTY
EACH
GUESS
COULDN'T WE HAVE LIKE ONE THAT COMES OUT
LIKE SO YOU HAVE ONE IN LIKE MM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE REALLY THICK
I MEAN REMOTE CONTROLS CAN BE THIN BITS
AND THEN YOU HAVE ONE FOR YOUR D. V. D. AND YOU SORT OF SLIDE IT OUT AND THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE YOU SLIDE IT OUT
HAVE SLIDES
AND THEN IT ALL COMES COMPACT
INTO ONE
SO IT'S NOT YOU ACTUALLY JUST PUTTING THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT REMOTES TOGETHER BUT MAKING THEM THINNER AND UM INTO ONE BASICALLY
SO YOU JUST FLIP THEM OUT
THAT WOULD BE COOL
I WAS THINKING THAT LIKE A FLIP
OKAY
UM
BUT WHAT'LL MAKE IT WHAT'LL MAKE IT INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE TO BUY THOUGH
I MEAN IF IT'S IF IT'S JUST LIKE
MM-HMM
MM
I THINK A FLIP UP THING 'CAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF LIKE IF IT'S ON THIS WELL I DID ANYWAY
LIKE WE HAD FIVE OR SIX REMOTES AND THEY WOULD BE LYING ON THE C ON THE COACH
AND YOU'D COME AND SIT DOWN AND OOH THE TELEPHONE'S THE TELEVISION SWITCHED ON OR SOMETHING
SO MAYBE SOMETHING THAT LIKE
DOES HAVE A LID OR CLOSES SO YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY PRESS A BUTTON OR RECORD BUTTON FOR SOMETHING
YEAH
BUT MAKE IT LIKE REALLY SNAZZY AND COOL PEOPLE WILL WANT IT
SO MAKE IT YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
AND EVEN FOR KIDS AS WELL
IT'S UM IT'S SAFER FOR THEM I GUESS
LIKE THEY DON'T FLICK ONTO
CHANNELS AND ALL THAT SL FLICK ONTO
MM
W WHAT DOES I. D. V. I. D. N. M. E. STAND FOR
AH RI OKAY
THESE ARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION

OKAY JOLLY GOOD
ALRIGHT LET'S HAVE UM WELL WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DEALING WITH
I THINK THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD LOOK AT IS UM PROBABLY THE UM WHAT IT IS THAT IT IS ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE
SO THAT'S GONNA BE YOU CATHERINE IF WE WANNA HEAR FROM YOU FIRST
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SCREWING IT IN JUST THERE YOU GO
AH
MM-HMM

OKAY
I PREFER THE PE I PREFER THE HUMAN TOUCH PERSONALLY
YEAH
DO YOU WANNA JUST GIVE US A MOMENT I JUST WANNA COPY THIS DOWN
UM I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS HAVE GOT ANY QUESTIONS FOR CATHERINE ON ANY OF THIS
YEAH YOU BLOW ON IT AND I
YEAH IT'S WORKED FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS YOU KNOW
HOW FAR AWAY IS YOUR TELEVISION
IT'S NEVER GONNA BE MORE THAN IT'S NEVER GONNA BE
YOU KNO UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A T. V. THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL PITCH IT'S NOT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THAT FAR DOES IT
DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A WALL BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE LOOKING THROUGH A WALL
YEAH YEAH I D IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU YOU W DON'T WANNA OVERCOMPLICATE THINGS
YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED IT
YEAH EXACTLY
BASICALLY WE'RE WE'RE DESI WE'RE DESIGNING AND MARKETING A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL UNIT
WE'RE NOT W W W W DESIGNING SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PLUG IN A HEADSET TO AND AND YOU KNOW CONNECT TO YOUR LAPTOP COMPUTER AND STUFF
IT'S UH
OKAY
RIGHT WELL DONE CATHERINE
UM GAB GABRIEL LET'S UH LET'S HEAR FROM YOU ON ON ON SUCH THINGS
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
GREAT
YEAH
GREAT
OKAY
NOW THAT'S I JUST HAVE A Q A Q QUESTION FOR YOU
THIS W UM RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING LOOKI LOOKING AT OTHER YOU KNOW EXISTING UNITS STUFF
UM HAVE YOU FOUND THAT ANYONE ELSE HAS DO HAS LOOKED INTO THE LOCKING FUNCTION OR
YEAH
YEAH
UM
I WOULD SAY
IT'S
IF IT'S SIMPLE TO DO
WHICH I THINK IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE EVEN IF IT'S A PHYSICAL YOU KNOW
A F A LIKE A F A PHYSICAL SWITCH OR A PHYSICAL COVER FOR THE REMOTE EVEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM THEN YES IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW
LIKE S YOU SAID EARLIER ON AB AB AB A FLIP THING SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT YOU KNOW BEING PHYSICAL
LOOK INTO
UM I'VE HAD WORD DOWN FROM HEAD OFFICE THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE CENTRED WELL
SOMETHING WE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS UM WE'VE GOTTA KEEP THE CORPORATE IMAGE WITHIN THIS REMOTE CONTROL UNIT
IT'S GOTTA D LOOK LIKE IT'S IN THE R. AND R.
YOU KNOW THE THE COMPANY IT'S IT'S FROM WHAT I CAN SEE FROM OUR OTHER PRODUCTS ARE YELLOW WITH BLUE WRITING ON THEM
UM
WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
THERE YOU GO
SO IT'S KINDA GOTTA LOOK IT'S GOTTA LOOK NEW AND S YOU KNOW SOMETHING FASHIONABLE
IF IF REMOTE CONTROL WELL IF TELEPHONES CAN BE FASHIONABLE THEN MAYBE REMOTE CONTROL UNITS CAN BE
YEAH
BECAUSE WE NEED
YEAH
GREAT
OKAY FANTASTIC
RIGHT WELL DONE GABRIEL
UM REISSA
LET'S PLUG YOU IN BABY
YEAH W IT IT JUST TAKES A WEE WHILE
'CAUSE WE'VE ONLY GOT FIVE CHANNELS
I THINK THAT'S K FLICKING QUICKLY BETWEEN CHANNELS
YEAH
WOW
YOU ARE A CHILD OF TECHNOLOGY AREN'T YOU
SO THERE YOU GO YEAH
UH BUT DO THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE THE MONEY
THEY THEY DON'T
IT'S OLDER GENERATION THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE GONE OUT AND
PEOPLE PEOPLE FROM THE AGE OF THIRTY F THERE'S A BIG DROP OFF THERE
FOR PEOPLE UP TO THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE YOU'RE KINDA SAYING YEAH THEY WANT IT
UM BUT NO THEY'RE NOT SORT OF MOST PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MONEY ARE PEOPLE FROM THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE
UH 'CAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY YEARS
UM D AND THA AND THAT'S A THAT'S QUITE A MINORITY THERE SO YEAH IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE FIFTY FIFTY THAT'S TH THIRTY FIVE PER CENT
YEAH
I WOULD SAY SCRA I'D SAY SCRAP THAT STRAIGHT OFF
SO Y SO IT'S SO IT'S SO YOU GOT SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE A LOOK INTO THEN I WHEN DESI WHEN DESIGNING THE ERGONOMICS OF SEE HAVE A LOOK IF UM THERE'S ANY W ANY MEDICAL BACKGROUND WE CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THIS
LET'S JUS WE JUST WANT NEED TO COVER OUR ARSES SO THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA SUE US IN TEN YEARS' TIME
SAY YOUR REMOTE CONTROL GAVE ME REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
YEAH
THEY'RE HAVING A LUNCH BREAK AT THE MOMENT BUT YEAH
I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET SEE IF I CAN GET HOLD OF THEM FOR THE NEXT MEETING
YEAH
OKAY
THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT REISSA
UM OKAY SO WE'VE BASICALLY
WE'VE DECIDE WE'VE D
WE'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S GONNA BE YOU KNOW UH WE'RE GOING FOR A BASIC TELEVISION REMOTE
IT'S GOTTA BE SAFE TO USE IT'S GOTTA LOOK COOL
IT'S GOTTA BE CHEAP
S UM
NOW GOING BACK TO THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF IT YOU KNOW WE WERE LOOKING AT WHETHER TO USE MAYBE INFRA RED OR BLUETOOTH
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST GO WITH THE SIMPLEST OPTION ON EVERYTHING UH AND THAT WOULD BE INFRA RED ENERGY SOURCE THAT WOULD BE BATTERIES
UH MEAN WE WE CAN LOOK INTO USING THE S YOU KNOW THE LITTLE TINY WEENY BATTERIES ALL LIKE SPECIAL LONG LASTING BATTERIES
UM
BUT A IN THERE'S NO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY POINT IN MAKING A REMOTE CONTROL UNIT THAT'S GONNA LAST FOR FIFTY YEARS
BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE CHANGED AND YOU KNOW WE WON'T HAVE TELEVISIONS IN TEN YEARS' TIME
SO
I THINK WE'RE ALL UM PRETTY SUSSED ON THAT
UM
ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
EVERYBODY HAPPY IN THEIR WORK
NOW THIS IS GOOD WE'VE GOT A GOOD STRUCTURE GOING ON
WE ALL KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE YOU BEEN GE HAS HAVE ANY OF YOU LOT BEEN GETTING LOADS OF CRAP SPAM ON YOUR COMPUTERS
YEAH
YEAH STUFF
UM OKAY
DO OH HAVE YOU GUYS FOUND OUT IF WE CAN IF WE CAN E MAIL STUFF TO EACH OTHER
RIGHT
DO ALL YOU ALL KNOW MY E MAIL ADDRESS
CAN YOU ALL D E MAIL ME YOUR E MAIL ADDRESSES
SEND ME YEAH YEAH OKAY
IS IT YELLOW AND BLACK OR IS IT YELLOW AND BLUE
I I KIND OF THOUGHT IT WAS BLUE WRITING ON A YELLOW BACKGROUND BUT I MIGHT BE JUST GOING A BIT
OKAY
WELL
MAYBE YOU CAN COME UP WITH A FEW WITH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT IDEAS
WELL SEE THE THING IS IS WE'VE GOTTA KEEP THE COMPANY IMAGE
IT'S GOTTA SAY PEOPLE HAVE GOTTA LOOK AT THIS REMOTE CONTROL AND INSTANTLY RECOGNISE THAT IT'S A REAL REACTION I PRODUCT
THERE'S LOADS OF COMPANIES THAT CALLED R. R.
THIS IS SLOG BUT THIS IS THE SLOGAN THIS IS THE THE THE THE TYPE
YEAH
WELL NOT NECESSARILY
BUT WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE IT
NOT NECESSARILY EVEN IF I IT JUST HAS TO YE BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PRODUCT AND INSTANTLY KNOW THAT IT'S ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS AS OPPOSED TO A SONY PRODUCT OR A
YOU KNOW A PANASONIC PRODUCT
IT'S GOT TO SO MAYBE SO YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK AT OUR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS AND SEE IF THEY ALL FOLLOW A S SIMILAR VEIN PERHAPS
YEAH
YEAH
QUITE POSS YEAH
WELL THIS IS ALL YOUR DEPARTMENT
MM OKAY
WELL WELL DONE EVERYBODY
AND UM I THINK WE UH STOP FOR LUNCH NOW
WE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE DONE
IF WE'VE IF WE'VE FINISHED AT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE MEETING'S SUPPOSED TO FINISH THEN THAT MEANS WE GET AN EXTRA FIVE MINUTES FOR LUNCH
YEAH THERE YOU GO
RIGHT
I JUST HAVE TO THERE'S A FEW LITTLE BITS AND PIECES I HAVE TO WRITE DOWN BUT
TAKE YOUR HEADSETS OFF KICK BACK SMOKE 'EM IF YOU GOT 'EM
MM
THA
OKAY
WHO IS GONNA DO A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
YOU WILL AS WELL
OKAY
YEP
OKAY I'M
OKAY
I'M CATHERINE WITH A C.
C. A. T. H.
E. R.
I. N. E.
RIGHT
TRUE
HOW LONG IS THE MEETING
OKAY
NO PROBLEM
OKAY
OKAY
UM JUST CONNECTING THIS
ARE WE GETTING I
REALLY
OKAY
COOL
OKAY
SO I'VE GOT A VERY QUICK UH
UH
OKAY
SO THE WORKING DESIGN I'VE GOT A VERY QUICK PRESENTATION ON THIS SO UM I'VE OH NO YOU CAN'T SEE A THING
OH WELL I'M GONNA DRAW IT ON THE BOARD THEN
IT'S IN BLUE UH AND I COULDN'T CHANGE IT
WE IT'S FINE ON MY SCREEN BUT NEVER MIND
SO UM THE IDEA IS THAT WE'VE GOT THE
ENERGY SOURCE UM WHICH IN OUR CASE WILL PR OH WELL OKAY NEVER MIND
SO UM I THINK MAYBE UH TWO BATTERIES I DUNNO WHAT THEY'RE CALLED SIX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH AND THEN
UM
THEN ON THE UH REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF WILL HAVE UM THE SENDER FOR THE SIGNAL WHICH COULD BE UH
AN INFRA RED SIGNAL
UM WHICH WILL BE SENT BY AN ELECTRONIC CHIP
AND UH THE CHIP WILL BE CONTROLLED BY THE USER INTERFACE
SO WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT LATER FROM GABRIEL
AND UH THE SENDER WILL SEND TO THE TELLY ITSELF AN INFRA RED SIGNAL TO TELL IT TO SWITCH ON OR SWITCH CHANNELS
UM AND THAT'S IT REALLY FOR THE WORKING DESIGN
SORRY THE PRESENTATION WASN'T VERY UH CLEAR BUT
REALLY
COOL
UM SHOULD I ERASE THIS OR
OKAY
FINE
OR SUGGESTIONS
WELL IT'S JUST YOU DON'T WANT IT PLUGGED IN REALLY S
IN INDOORS
I DUNNO SWI I TH I TH I THINK CHANGING YOUR BATTERIES ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS IS NOT REALLY A PAIN BUT
YEAH
WELL THE THING IS UH YOU YOU DON'T
WELL WE CAN MAKE THE THE SIGNAL STRONG ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH WALLS IF IF YOU FANCY IT
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT
BUT
WHY NOT
I JUST THINK THAT IT'S IT'S GONNA COST MORE AND I'M I'M NOT SURE IT'S YOU'RE GONNA USE IT
IT'S A FANCY IDEA UH IT'S QUITE NICE BUT THEN I DON'T TH I DUNNO
EITHER YOU IF YOU WANNA WATCH THE TELLY YOU'RE IN THE ROOM YOU ARE GONNA
BUT
OH WE CAN WE CAN KEEP THE IDEA IF YOU I
WE CAN SEE AT A LATER STAGE MAYBE I DON'T
DO YOU NEED THE BORDER
OKAY
SORRY
WELL MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T WATCH SO MUCH T. V. THEN
MAYBE IT COULD BE INSTEAD OF PRESSING BUTTON IT COULD BE JUST TOUCHING A
YEP
WELL IN THE PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT YOU'VE GOT THE ADDRESSES I THINK
SO PROJECT MANAGER IT'S PARTICIPANT ONE AT A. M. I.
YOU HAVE THEM I YOU HAVE THEM BUT WE'LL SEND YOU AN E MAIL
YOU WANT TO HAVE FRIENDS DON'T YOU
IT WOULDN'T BE
WELL YOU COULD
IT COULD COME
BUT IT COULD COME IN DIFFERENT COLOURS AND HAVE THE R. R. COLOURS JUST SOMEWHERE LIKE JUST AROUND THE LOCK BUTTON COULD BE THE R. R. LOGO OR COLOURS AND
IF
COOL
RIGHT IT WAS FUNCTION F. EIGHT OR SOMETHING
THIS ONE RIGHT THERE
OKAY
THINK WE ALL
HUH
OH I THOUGHT WE ALL WERE
YEAH I HAVE ONE TOO OKAY
S
WHOOPS I FORGOT TO PUT THE THING ON
OKAY
YEAH
SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
UH GABRIEL
E. L.
THINK SHE'S FINISHING UP HER PRESENTATION
OH
YEAH ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCE LIKE WIN WIND POWER OR
BICYCLE POWER
ONE QUESTION I HAVE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CONTROL WE HAVE OVER THIS IS UM
AS FAR AS THE INFRA RED SIGNAL DO WE HAVE CONTROL OVER
YOU KNOW HOW FAR AWAY YOU CAN BE FROM THE RECEIVING UNIT THE THE T. V. AND STILL HAVE IT BE OPERATIONAL
I MEAN MAYBE WE WANT ONE WITH A STRONG SIGNAL STREAM
UH
THAT'S TRUE
OKAY
UH I'M JUST GONNA USE THE POWERPOINT UH
TECHNICAL
OKAY
OKAY SO WHILE THIS IS WARMING UP THERE IT IS UH
SO I'M DOING THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
YEAH AND BASICALLY UH AS FAR AS METHODS I WAS I WAS LOOKING LOOKING AT
LOOKING AT UH ALREADY EXISTING REMOTES TRYING TO FIND SOME INSPIRATION FROM DESIGNS THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE
THINKING OF WHAT WE CAN RETAIN WHAT WE CAN DO AWAY WITH UH WHAT WE WHAT WE CAN PERFECT A LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS DESIGN UM
WE DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TOO RADICAL OF A CHANGE I GUESS I MEAN PEOPLE WANT A REMOTE THAT'S FAMILIAR
THAT HAS THEIR FAVOURITE FUNCTIONALITIES UM AND AND DOES THE BASICS BUT
UM SO WE CAN IMPROVE WHAT'S OUT THERE AND MAINTAIN THAT
THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY THAT PEOPLE WANT
UM SO THINGS THAT SEEM LIKE ABSOLUTE MUST HAVES UH WOULD BE A VOLUME CONTROL
UM SO UP DOWN KEYS FOR THAT UH CHANNEL KEYS UP DOWN
BUT THEN ALSO A NUMERICAL KEY PAD SO THAT THEY CAN JUST KEY DIRECTLY TO THE CHANNEL THAT THEY WANT
RATHER THAN DOING UP DOWN AND UH A MUTE BUTTON
UH ONE THING THAT I DIDN'T INCLUDE HERE THAT I FORGOT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME WAS DOING UM SOME SORT OF LOCK UH FUNCTION
UH I DON'T I DUNNO UH THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY
AND SO IN THE RESEARCH THAT I WAS DOING
THERE'S BASICALLY TWO TYPES OF REMOTES ONES THAT ARE ENGINEERING CENTRED AND ONES THAT ARE MORE USER CENTRED
WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN ACCESS THE WEB PAGE FROM HERE BUT I CAN SHOW YOU UH
YEAH
SO THIS IS A ENGINEER CENTRED ONE SO YOU SEE IT'S RATHER BUSY BUT IT ALSO LETS YOU PLAY YOUR MOVIE
STOP YOUR MOVIE FAST FORWARD ALL THIS UM FREEZE FRAME
UH AND THIS IS A USER CENTRED ONE
UH IT'S IT'S EASIER TO G JUST GLANCE AT THIS AND SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE TO DO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE STARING AT IT FOR FIVE MINUTES
AND I JUDGING FROM WHAT WHAT WE ALL TALKED ABOUT DURING OUR LAST MEETING I KIND OF GATHERED THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WERE GOING AFTER
UH OR THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING IN AT LEAST
UM
SO THE ENGINEERING CENTRED ONES UH PROVIDE A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY
BUT IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OVERWHELMING SO THE USER CENTRED ONES JUST FOCUS ON EASE OF USE
UH AND THIS SORT OF OVERLAPS WITH WHAT THE MARKETING PERSON UH REISSA
BECAUSE UH WE WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT BEFORE WE MAKE FIRM DECISIONS ON THIS
SO UH YEAH THAT'S ME
NO THAT THAT THAT SEEMED LIKE A NOVEL IDEA AS F AS FAR AS I KNOW
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER EXISTS LIKE YOU LIKE YOU SAID IN IN MOBILE PHONES
THAT WAS SORT OF THE INSPIRATION FOR IT
UM I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT WITH IN IN ALL MY YEARS IN IN THE REMOTE BUSINESS
I'VE HAVEN'T I'VE NEVER SEEN A LOCKING FUNCTIONALITY
I DUNNO WHAT UH DO YOU GUYS HAVE A A YEA OR NAY ON THAT A FEELING ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S REALLY NECESSARY
YEAH
MM-HMM
'KAY
RIGHT
MM
RIGHT
AND OUR MOTTO IS IS WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
I THINK I THINK WE HAVE TO CARRY THAT MENTAL
MM
WELL YEAH THESE I THINK
WE CAN SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE LAYOUT IN MY PRESENTATION AND WHAT I DIDN'T MENTION YET REALLY IS IS THE SORT OF LIKE THE ERGONOMIC DESIGN
I T I THINK WE CAN MAKE BIG IMPROVEMENTS OVER THESE TWO THAT YOU SEE HERE I MEAN
UH EVERYTHING IS GOING T ERGONOMIC YOU KNOW
THERE'S YOU KNOW MICE FOR YOUR COMPUTERS THAT ARE VERY ERGONOMIC AND KEYBOARDS AND THAT COULD BE ONE OF OUR NICHES P SORT OF UH UH IN THE MARKET
I GUESS
UM
YEAH
UH YEAH THIS IS GETTING ALL
MM
YEAH THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO DO FUNCTION F. EIGHT AND IT SHOULD COME UP
YEAH IT JUST TAKES A SECOND UH
YEAH YOU WANNA NAVIGATE THE CHANNELS QUICKLY I GUESS
MM
NO I WOULD I WOULD SAY THE OLDER THE OLDER PEOPLE YEAH
YEAH THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS AS WELL
WHAT ABOUT JUST FROM THE THE PROSPECTIVE OF OUR MANUFACTURING COST
I MEAN IF IF IT'S TWELVE FIFTY PER UNIT
I MEAN OKAY THERE'S
UH
REPETITIVE STRAIN UH REP REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY OR LIKE FROM DOING
MM
MM
YEAH WE SHOULD PROBABLY CONSULT WITH OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT UH
YEAH
I THINK WE CAN DO SOME REALLY IN IN THAT DEPARTMENT THE THE ERGONOMIC DEPARTMENT WE CAN MAKE SOME SOME REALLY GOOD IMPROVEMENTS
MM
YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL ON THE PRETTY MUCH ON THE SAME PAGE
OH IT'S PROBABLY JUST YOU 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE PROJECT MANAGER
SELL TRYING TO SELL YOUR THINGS
OKAY
NO I DON'T
I
UH
OH IT'S JUST PARTICIPANT ONE OH OKAY
YEAH
WELL IT'S JUST W IT'S JUST IT'S JUST PAR PARTICIPANT ONE PARTICIPANT TWO
SO ARE WE HEADED TOWARDS LIKE A B A BIG YELLOW AND BLACK REMOTE AS FAR AS MAYBE THAT'S OUR NEXT MEETING THAT WE DISCUSS THAT
WELL IT'S LIKE WHITE ON I WHITE AND BLUE ON A BLACK BACKGROUND WITH WHITE WITH YELLOW BORDERS
MAYBE THAT'S LIKE GETTING AHEAD OF OURSELVES
MM
MM
MM
MM
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME ON DOWN FROM FROM THE HIGHER UPS SO I MEAN WE ARE SORT OF BEHOLDEN TO THEM
NOT ONE COLOUR BUT THE PATTERN NEEDS TO BE RECOGNISABLE
YEAH PRETTY SOON I THINK I GUESS THAT'S NOW
ALRIGHT SEE YOU ALL SOON
I AM REISSA
R. E. I. S. S. A.
DOUBLE S. A. YEAH YEAH
SORRY
MM 'KAY
MM
I'M FINE
YEAH
I UH YEAH YEAH
D I MEAN I I'M FINISHING OFF MY PRESENTATION
NO NO
UH I'M DONE
OKAY
MM
IS A BATTERY LIKE
THE ONLY WAY OF
NO NO
NO I MEANT LIKE
NO 'CAUSE LIKE CHA 'CAUSE ALWAYS CHANGING UM UM BATTERIES CAN GET LIKE ANNOYING
THE BATTERY'S DOWN AND MAYBE I DUNNO SOLAR CHARGED
MM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT IF LIKE YOU'RE ON THE PHONE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU NEED TURN TELEVISION OFF OR SOMETHING AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO INTO THE PUT THE TELEPHONE DOWN
AND GO INTO THE OTHER ROOM
HOW ABOUT BLUETOOTH
INSTEAD OF USING INFRA RED
USE BLUETOOTH
ISN'T THAT A BETTER SIGNAL
MM
MM
'S JUST AN IDEA
ADJUSTING
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
MM
OKAY
WHERE DOES IT GO INTO
HERE
THE BLUE THING
WELL FUNCTION F. EIGHT
NO OH
COME ON
RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
WELL FOR OUR MARKETING REPORT UH WE OBSERVED REMOTE CONTROL USERS IN A USABILITY LAB
AND ALSO GAVE SO THIS IS RESEARCH AND WE ALSO GAVE PARTICIPANTS UM QUESTIONNAIRES TO FILL OUT
UM TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE TESTED WERE A HUNDRED JUST SO YOU KNOW SO THAT HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE TESTED AND THESE WERE THE FINDINGS
SO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF USERS FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL UGLY
OKAY SO THEY DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM EIGHTY F EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEM WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY IF THE REM REMOTE CONTROL LOOKED REALLY COOL AND FANCY
SO I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT
UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL WITH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER
SO THEY DON'T LIKE LIKE THE WAY THEY OPERATE IT DOESN'T
LIKE MATCH HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE
UM PER CENT OF THE USERS SAY THAT THEY ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTONS ON A REMOTE SO PROBABLY IF YOU HAVE LIKE ONE
TWO THREE FOUR FIVE THE WHOLE UP TO Z TEN THEY PROBABLY DON'T USE THOSE THEY ONLY USE THE UP AND DOWN CHANNEL
EXACTLY
THAT'S ANOTHER THING
UM SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF USERS SAY THEY ZAP
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THEY MEAN ZAP GOES LIKE
YEAH
MM
UM TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE
I THINK ESPECIALLY FOR UH THE OLDER GENERATION
I KNOW MY GRANDMOTHER DOESN'T LIKE MOBILE PHONES TAKES AGES TO WORK HOW TO USE
ANYWAY UM AND THEY ALSO REMOTES OFTEN GET LOST IN THE ROOM SO NOBODY CAN FIND THEM
SO MAYBE TRACKING DEVICES IS A GOOD IDEA
UM PERSONAL PREFERENCES
UM SO YEAH UM I WAS THINKING SOMETHING EASY TO USE ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER PEOPLE
UM HAS TO LOOK REALLY COOL FLASHY GROOVY FOR PEOPLE TO BUY IT
AND IT'S EASY TO FIND SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MAYBE AND ALSO WE ASKED THEM WHETHER THEY WANTED WHETHER THEY'D BE INTERESTED IN UM VOICE ACTIVATING
SO VOICE ACTIVATION
SO AND THIS WAS WHAT WE CAME UP WITH
THEN IF YOU LOOK FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE THIS IS AGE SORRY AGE GROUPS
SO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE SAID LIKE NINETY TWO NINETY ONE PER CENT OF THEM SAID YES
UM SO BASICALLY THE MAJORITY EXCEPT FOR THE FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLDS FOR SOME REASON DIDN'T WANT A VOICE ACTIVATED ONE
AND NEITHER DID THE OLDER GENERATION BUT THE YOUNGER GENERATION WHO WE ARE CATERING FOR
LIKE WHO HAVE MOST OF THE MONEY NOWADAYS DO WANT A VOICE ACT SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE
WELL THE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD AND THIRTY FIVE AND THE THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE
FORTY FIVE POINT SEVEN PER CENT SAY NO SO
SO THEY DON'T
WELL
THESE GUYS ARE GROWING UP
VOICE ACTIVATION MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST
UM ALSO WITH UM WITH BUTTONS A THING CALLED R. S. I. SO WRIST SENSE HUH
YEAH REPETITIVE STRAINS INJURY SO THEY DON'T I THINK PEOPLE WHO WATCH T. V. MAYBE TOO OFTEN KEEP CHANGING CHANNEL HURTS THEIR WRIST
I DON'T THINK SO
YEAH MAYBE NOT SO HARD
YEAH
MAYBE
MM
YEAH
MM
MAYBE TH THE BUTTONS NOT SO HIGH UP SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS SO MUCH OR WE JUST LIKE FLAT BUTTONS SOMETHING
YEAH
SO THAT IS ME
MM
MM
MM
WELL JUST QUESTIONNAIRES
YEAH YOU CAN
I THINK HE'S PARTICIPANT ONE AREN'T YOU
CAN'T WE HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS IN THE REMOTES SO SOMEBODY CAN CHOOSE DIFFERENT COL LIKE DOES IT HAVE TO BE OF A CERTAIN
BUT IF IT'S A R. R. IT WOULD BE REAL REACTION LIKE IF IT HAD A SYMBOL ON IT
WHOA
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE IT ONE COLOUR
MM
MM
MM
ARE WE ARE WE FINISHED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
'KAY UH
I FEEL LIKE MADONNA WITH ONE OF THESE ON
I SAID I FEEL LIKE MADONNA WITH ONE OF THESE ON
RIGHT
HELLO EVERYBODY
BACK AGAIN FOR ANOTHER WONDERFUL MEETING
IS UH EVERYONE READY
OKAY WE C WE CAN HOLD ON FOR A MINUTE
I FIGURED WITH THE SPAM THING IF YOU CAN'T BEAT IT JOIN IN
ARE YOU READY
OKAY RIGHT WELL I TAKE IT THAT YOU ARE ALL READY NOW
UM ALRIGHT FIRST OFF WE'LL JUST UH RECAP FROM OUR LAST MEETING
UM WHICH WAS WE GOT TOGETHER JUST TO BASICALLY DECIDE ON WELL TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY UH SUPPOSED TO BE DOING
AND WHO WE ALL ARE AND STUFF LIKE THAT MM GET BIT MORE OF AN IDEA TOGETHER OF WHAT'S GOING ON
UM WHAT WE ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT IN THIS MEETING IS UM
NOW THAT WE KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE DOING
NOW WE KNOW THAT IT'S A T. V. REMOTE AND STUFF AND YOU GUYS HAVE JUST BEEN OFF DOING SOME SOME UH R. AND D. FOR THAT
THAT'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T HEARD THAT BEFORE SEE I'M LEARNING ALL SORTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGI TERMS IN TECHNOLOGY TODAY
UM YEAH WE'RE GONNA HEAR YOUR UH TH THREE LITTLE PRESENTATIONS WHETHER THEY BE ON COMPUTER OR ON THE WHITEBOARD OR WHATEVER YOU WANT
UM I'D LIKE TO UM HEAR O I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHO'S G WHO'S ON THE UM FROM FROM UH CATHERINE ACTUALLY FIRST
I WANT WHAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IS UH IF WE'VE FINALLY DECIDED ON UM WHAT SORT OF ENERGY WE'RE GONNA BE USING AND
IT'S JUST THAT YEAH LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM YOU FIRST
GET YOURSELF IN POSITION
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US REMEMBER THE FIFTIES
DO SOL SOLAR PANEL THINGS DO THEY HAVE TO WORK FROM THE SUN OR CAN THEY WORK FROM A LIGHT BULB
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
OKAY
MM
OKAY JOLLY GOOD
WHAT'S A DOUBLE CURVED ONE
OKAY
SO THAT MIGHT BE AN IDEA OF USING THE RUBBER BUT THEN IT SHOULD YOU KNOW YEAH
WHEN A T. V. PROGRAMME'S GOT ONE WATCHING THE MATCH AND YOUR TEAM'S JUST LOST
YOU CAN FUZZ IT ACROSS THE ROOM AND IT'LL BOUNCE OFF THE WALL BACK AT YOU
YEAH I LIKE THAT IDEA
RUBBER WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL GOING WE'RE ALL LIKING THAT IDEA
YOU THINK YOU CAN MARKET THAT
OOH WE LIKE RUBBER OOH
UH-HUH
WELL WE'RE GONNA GO WITH I THINK WE'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S GONNA BE A RUBBER CASE SO
PUSH BUTTONS INSTEAD OF THE WHEEL
RUBBLE DOUBLE DOUBLE
I'LL HAVE A BIG MAC PLEASE
LET'S HAVE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS HEY
YEAH
SIMPLE YEAH
CHIP ON PRINT
IT'S A BIT
OKAY UH WHAT I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HERE
IS UH OKAY ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
WHICH I PRESUME IS LIKE ONE P. C. B. AND THAT'S GOT ALL THE ELECTRONICS ON ONE BOARD INCLUDING THE UM INFRA RED SENDER
RIGHT
UM WHAT A WHAT ALTERNATIVES DO WE HAVE TO THAT
Y UM WHAT ALTERNATIVES DO WE HAVE TO THE CHIP ON PRINT
SO IT SOUNDS
SO WHY WOULD WE NOT GO FOR THAT
IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S INSIDE THE THE UNIT
I IT DOESN'T AFFECTS WHETHER THE CUSTOMER'S GONNA BUY IT OR NOT
UM WE WANNA GO FOR AN I I ALL SO LONG AS IT WORKS
YOU KNOW
SO LET'S NOT LET'S UH NOT BOTHER WITH THE CHIP ON PRINT
YEAH
S YEAH PUSH BUTTONS
WHAT ABOUT WHAT
WELL WHAT DO WE NEED A SPEAKER FOR IN A REMOTE CONTROL UNIT
S
YEAH
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANNA T GO INTO WITH THIS PRODUCT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BASIC BATTERY
IT'S CHEAP IT'S CHEERFUL IT'S WORKED DOES WORK
WE WERE GO WE WERE GOING WITH THE LATE WITH THE THE R. S. I. RUBBER WEREN'T WE
THE THE
THE DOUBLE WHOPPER PLEASE
YEP BUT WE'RE GOING FOR THE SIMPLE BUTTONS
YEAH
AND IT'S CHEAPEST ALL ROUND IT SOUNDS KINDA FUNKY
AND WE CAN ALSO MARKET IT AS I 'CAUSE WE WERE S SAYING EARL YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER IN YOUR RESEARCH THAT UM THE THE PEOPLE HAVE THE R. PEOPLE WERE GETTING THE COMPLAINING ABOUT R. S. I.
AND THIS IS ANTI R. S. I.
SO THAT'S ANOTHER MARKETING POINT THAT WE CAN USE
BUT ANYTHING IS GONNA HAVE BUTTONS
EVEN IF IT'S A JOG WHEEL IT'S STILL REPETITIVE
YOU
YOU SEE YOU CAN STILL GET IT DOES YOU STILL GET REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY WHETHER YOU ARE PRESSING A BUTTON OR PRESSING A FLAT BIT OF SCREEN
IT'S THE V IT'S THE FACT THAT YOU ARE PRESSING THE SAME DOING THE SAME MOVEMENT
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING
BUT THE FACT THAT THIS THIS RUBBER I IS ACTUALLY USED IN THESE ANTI R. S. I. PS SPECIFIC
YEAH
AND YOU KNOW YEAH YOU CAN FUZZ IT ACROSS THE ROOM AND THROW IT AT THROW IT AT YOUR CHILDREN YEAH
OKAY GABRIEL
LET'S UM LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT THE UM IT'S THE INTERFACE
GREAT
MM
MM
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
DO WE HAVE AN UH EXAMPLE OF A GOOD ONE
BRILLIANT
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL LET'S UM SO W WHAT ARE OUR DEFINITE DECISIONS ON THIS THEN AS A TEAM
THE UM
THE THE UM THE INTERFACE TYPE WE'RE GOING FOR
JUST THE SIMPLE S SIMPLE STRAIGHT SET OF BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY AND WE'RE NOT YEAH
ARE WE GONNA HAV HAV AN ARE WE D HAVE WE DECIDED ON WHETHER
W WE'RE GONNA S SUPPLEMENT IT WITH ANYTHING YOU KNOW COLOURS OR PARTICULAR GIMMICKY BITS TO IT WE'RE NOT WE'RE JUST GONNA GO FOR SOMETHING
WE'RE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKEY DOKEY
YEAH I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS
LET'S MOVE OVER TO
YEAH SURE
YEAH THE BUTTON THAT JUST DOES THAT YEAH
COOL
MM YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH WHY SHOULD PEOPLE BUY THIS WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY GOT A REMOTE THAT CAME WITH THE T. V.
WHAT'S THAT MEAN
OKAY NOW THE TROUBLE IS IS WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING WITH THE STUFF THAT WORKS ALREADY THAT'S CHEAP
YEAH
MAYBE WE COULD UM
OF COURSE THEY DO
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THAT'S YOUR FIRST THING YOU GO OH I'M NOT GONNA BUY THAT 'CAUSE I DUNNO IF IT WORKS OR NOT
OKAY WELL WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK ABOUT THIS
YEAH WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT M
YEAH AND IT THIS IS JUST GONNA ALL THIS IS BEING USED FOR IS YOUR TELEVISION
IT WOULD THAT WOULD MEAN YOU'D NEED A TELEVISION THAT HAS BLUETOOTH IN IT WHICH NO NO TELEVISION DOES DOES IT
THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D HAVE TO MAKE A TELEVISION AS WELL
NO THAT WOULD BE YOUR TELEPHONE IN WITH YOUR TELEVISION
YEAH AND I
NAH THE TELEVI THE TELEVISION WOULD HAVE TO BE A BLUETOOTH COMPATIBLE BASICALLY
AN AND THERE IS NO THERE IS NO SUCH THING
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH THIS THAT'S THAT'S VERY GOOD
AND AND THIS IS ALL TYING IN VERY NICELY
THE FACT THAT IT'S MADE OUT OF THIS RUBBER WE CAN THROW IT ABOUT
TH WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO THROW THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS ABOUT BECAUSE IT CHARGES ITSELF UP BY DOING IT
BUT YEAH BY THE SQUEEZING IT THE
YEAH THAT'S A GREAT IDEA
WELL DONE
YEAH
I WANNA WATCH THE PINEAPPLE CHANNEL
WELL SPONGY THAT'S WHERE
YEAH WE'RE WE'RE AHEAD OF THE GAME THERE
OKAY
ALRIGHT YEAH NO THIS I THIS IS GOOD SO THROUGH ALL THAT WE'VE WE GO WE'RE RIGHT
WE'RE GONNA GO GO BACK TO UM GOING WITH THE KINETIC THING THAT'S GREAT
USING THE SPONGY RUBBER THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT ANTI R. S. I. YOU CAN AS YOU SQUEEZE IT YOU ARE NOT ONLY THERAPEUTICISING YOURSELF
YOU ARE CHARGING THE BATTERIES AND UM I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE BUTTONS BEING IN THE SHAPE OF FRUIT THOUGH
YEAH THIS IS TRUE
WELL OKAY IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY FINALLY UM AGREED ON IS
ITS IMAGE
LIKE YEAH WE'RE WE'RE SAYING NO WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
BUT WE DUNNO WHAT IT SHOULD BE OR LIKE ARE WE GOING YEAH IT LOOKS SLICK
BUT WHAT DO WHAT DO WE MEAN BY SLICK SORT OF THING
I MEAN YOU SAID EARLIER ON I IT SHOULD BE FUNKY
L KEEP IT CLEAN KEEP IT CLEAN
BRIGHT BUT NOT TOO BRIGHT
LIKE THE VOLUME BUTTONS SHOULD BE THE ALL THE SAME COLOUR AND THE D AND THE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS SHOULD BE ONE COLOUR AND STUFF LIKE THAT
DO YOU MEAN
OKAY WHAT
OKAY
THA
YEAH I MEAN WE THAT'S WE WE
YEAH
THIS IS THE REMOTE CONTROL TOMATO
YEAH
WELL IT'S IT'S GOTTA BE CHEW PROOF
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD MARKET IT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS FOR DIFFERENT SO WE COULD DO LIKE THE PINK RANGE
THE BLUE RANGE THE GREEN RANGE THE
MM
WELL THAT'S THAT CAN BE DOWN TO BIT OF MARKET RESEARCHING YOU KNOW IF THAT'S EASY ENOUGH TO FIND OUT WHAT COLOURS ARE MORE POPULAR
MM
OKAY
ALRIGHT
WELL UM WE'LL ALRIGHT LET'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA AIM TO GET TOGETHER BY THE NEXT MEETING THEN UM
IS
FROM YOU CATHERINE WI YOUR Y Y YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON THE THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
UM GABRIEL YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON YOU KNOW COME UP WITH THE THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
THEN BASICALLY YOU TWO ARE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS
YOU WON'T BE GOING OFF TO YOUR SEPARATE OFFICES
UM AND I THINK YOU ARE GONNA GET A CHANCE TO PLAY WITH SOME CLAY
I THINK YEAH IT'S GONNA YOU KNOW COME UP KI YOU KNOW
BE AB FOR THE NEXT MEETING BE ABLE TO COME IN AND SHOW US SOME SOME I SOME PHYSICAL IDEAS
'CAUSE AT THE MOMENT UH YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S HARD
WE WERE KINDA GOING YEAH IT'S GOTTA FEEL NICE IT'S GOTTA LOOK COOL AND THAT IT'S YOU KNOW NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY START
YOU KNOW S SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL SOMETHING OR OTHER
UM AND YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON THE PRODUCT EVALUATION
UM
AND I
WILL BE UH
TALKING TO THE BOSSES BASICALLY AND UH
F FIELDING OFF SOME MORE SPAM AND
UH
THAT'S IT REALLY
KEEPING THINGS T WELL UH YOU KNOW HO HOPEFULLY UH KEEPING THINGS TOGETHER
UM
YEAH THAT'S
THIS IS THIS IS UH GOOD
SO WE KNOW FOR DEFINITE WE KNOW WE'VE WE'VE NOW GOT SOME DEFINITE THINGS GOING ON
WE DEFINITELY KNOW HOW IT'S POWERED WE DEFINITELY KNOW THAT UM IT'S GONNA BE A SIMPLE BUTTONS
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE GOING FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL CHIP ON PRINT EXPENSIVE THINGS SO WE'VE WE'RE KEEPING THE COSTS DOWN
IT'S THIS RUBBER CASING THAT WE CAN SELL AS UM FUN AND FUNKY
DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE MADE OUT OF THIS STUFF
PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING OH STANDARD STUFF GIVES YOU REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
WELL THIS REMOTE CONTROL IS DESIGNED TO DO THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE
IT'S SUPPOSED TO FIX IT RATHER THAN CAUSE IT
UM
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA WE WE'RE GONNA AS A SORT OF EXTRA SOMETHING ON IT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT EXTRA THINGS ARE THERE EXTRA THINGS THIS PRODUCT HAVE
WE'LL LOOK INTO THIS LOCK KEY
FACILITY ALTHOUGH WHETHER OR NOT IT HAPPENS OR IS POSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW BUT SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO
OKAY
I THINK THAT'S UM WELL DONE EVERYBODY
ANYONE HAVE ANY UH
ANY QUESTIONS EVERYONE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL I'M SURE YOU'LL SOON GET AN E MAIL ABOUT IT
OKAY
RIGHT WELL
IT'S UM WE'RE WE'VE STILL COUPLE OF MINUTES UNTIL OUR MEETING'S DUE TO FINISH
BUT UM
I GOT A NOTE SAYING THAT YOU TWO WHO ARE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER SO BEF BEFORE YOU ALL DISAPPEAR OFF JUST
HOLD HOLD FIRE
UM
UM I THINK IT'S UH YEAH I THINK IT'S GONNA BE PAR PART MORE OF A PROFIT SHARING ON THE PRODUCT
YEAH I THINK I I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AT THE MOMENT
YEAH
YEAH
I WANT A SHARE IN THE SPACE ROCKET
DID YOU SEE THAT THIS K THAT THIS COMPANY WE'VE MADE A SPACESHIP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
AND THE SPACESHIP DOESN'T HAVE THE R. HAVE A MASSIVE R. AND R. DOWN THE SIDE OF IT BUT I STILL WANT ONE
OKAY
UM I'VE JUST HAD A SIGN FLASHING UP SAYING FINISH THE MEETING
UH
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S NOT TELLING IT'S NOT SAYING DO ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR JUST YET
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO YOUR OWN OFFICES
YEAH
YEAH IT SAYS YOU TWO
ALMOST
MM 'KAY
NO NO NO NO IT'S FINE I'M JUST PREPARING
OKAY
WHERE IS THAT THING
OH SORRY COULDN'T SEE
WOULD THAT WORK
OKAY SO THAT'S ME AGAIN
UM SO UM FOR THE ENERGY SOURCES WE CAN HAVE A BASIC BATTERY
A HAND DYNAMO WHICH IS WHICH WAS USED UH IN THE FIFTIES FOR TORCHES
IF YOU REMEMBER THAT KIND OF WHICH WOULDN'T BE V WOULDN'T BE V V YEAH YEAH
IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FANCY
YOU CAN HAVE A KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY WHICH IS USED ON SOME WATCHES THESE DAYS
SO IF YOU HAVE JUST A BIT OF GENTLE MOVEMENT THAT IT WILL GIVE IT THE ENERGY TO WORK
OR YOU CAN USE SOLAR CELLS BUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT INDOORS REALLY BUT
YEAH
I DUNNO ACTUALLY
I DUNNO
UM
THINK THE THE UH WHAT WOULD COST THE LESS WOULD BE THE BASIC BATTERY REALLY
AND UH IF WE WANT SOMETHING FANCIER I THINK THE KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY COULD BE NICE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH THE COST
SO WE'VE GOT TO DISCUSS THAT
FOR THE CASE OF THE REMOTES ITSELF UM THEY CAN BE A GENERAL CASE WHICH IS JUST A FLAT ONE
YOU CAN HAVE UH A CURVED ONE OR A DOUBLE CURVED ONE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO
YOU KNOW KIND OF MORE ERGONOMIC THAT KIND OF SUITS THE PALM OF YOUR HAND THAT KIND OF THING
SO
UM THEN THE CASE MATERIAL ITSELF SO IT CAN BE UH UH EITHER PLASTIC OR LATEX
UH RUBBER WOOD OR TITANIUM
AND TH FOR EACH OF THEM YOU HAVE UH CASES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE TITANIUM
YOU CAN'T USE IT FOR IF YOU IF WE'RE CHOOSING A DOUBLE CURVED CASE WE CAN'T CHOOSE TITANIUM
AND IF WE ARE CHOOSING UM SOLAR CELLS THEN WE CAN'T CHOOSE LATEX FOR THE CASE MATERIAL SO WE JUST HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT
BUT IF WE'RE CHOOSING JUST THE FLAT CASE THEN WE CAN GO FOR ANYTHING
AND I THINK WE DISCUSSED EARLIER ON THE R. S. I. PROBLEM THING SO WE COULD UH
YEAH
YEAH
AND ALSO IT DOESN'T BREAK AS EASILY MAYBE I DUNNO
SO RUBBER WOULD BE
OKAY
UH S SO IF D OKAY
AND THEN THERE ARE THE PUSH BUTTONS SO YOU CAN HAVE BASIC PUSH BUTTONS OR A SCROLL WHEELS LIKE YOU HAVE ON A MOUSE
UM OR YOU COULD HAVE UM L. C. D. WHICH GIVES YOU A DISPLAY
UM SCROLL BUTTONS AS WELL
SO IF YOU USE A RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE YOU MUST USE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS
SO IF WE'RE GOING FOR RUBBER THEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE FOR THE CASE
UM AND IF WE CHOOSE DOUBLE CURVED THEN WE HAVE TO GO FOR RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS
SO IT'S A CONSTRAINT
YEAH BUT IS IT A DOUBLE CURVED ONE OR NOT
IF IT'S NOT A DOUBLE CURVED THEN WE'VE GOT THE CHOICE FOR THE PUSH BUTTONS IF IT'S A DOUBLE CURVE WE'VE GOTTA GO FOR RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS
IF THAT MAKES SENSE
YEAH
NO BUT NA LE YOU SEE YOU'VE GOT OKAY THE ENERGY THAT'S ONE THING
THEN YOU HAVE THE CASE IS UH WHETHER IT'S FLAT OR CURVED
AND THAT'S WE DON'T CARE IF IT'S RUB RUBBER OR NOT BUT THEN WE'VE DECIDED THAT WE GOING FOR RUBBER FOR THE CASE MATERIAL
SO IF WE'VE CHOSEN RUB RUBBER AND IF NOW WE HAVE THE CHOICE FOR THE CASE WHETHER IT'S FLAT SINGLE CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED
AND I'M JUST SAYING IF IT IF WE CHOOSE IT TO BE DOUBLE CURVED THEN WE NEED TO GO I DUNNO WHY
BUT WE NEED TO GO FOR UH RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS
SO EITHER
I DUNNO WE JUST NEED TO DECIDE ON THE ON THE CASE
LET'S GO CRAZY
AND THEN DO I HAVE A LAST SLIDE
YES I DO
UM SO THE PUSH BUTTONS THEMSELVES THEY CAN BE JUST SIMPLE OR THEY CAN BE SO THAT'S JUST THE ELECTRONICS BETWEEN THE BUT BEHIND THE PUSH BUTTONS
UM AND THE PRICE THAT GO WITH IT WITH IT SO THE SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS ARE GONNA BE THE CHEAPEST
UH IF WE GET A SCROLL WHEEL THAT'S A HIGHER PRICE RANGE
IF WE GET AN ADVANCED CHIP WHICH IS UM USED FOR THE L. C. D. THE DISPLAY THING THEN THAT'S EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE
MM
YEAH
THE INFRA RED
YEAH
WELL IF IF IT'S NOT CHIP ON PRINT THEN I GUESS YOU GET DIFFERENT CHIP COMPONENTS AND YOU BUILD THEM SEPARATELY AND DOESN'T INCLUDE THE INFRA RED
IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE MM
TECHNICALLY SPEAKING IT'S NOT AS ADVANCED BUT IT DOES THE JOB TOO
FO
IT DOESN'T YEAH YEAH YEAH
TOTALLY
YEAH
SO LET'S NOT GO FOR THE
YEAH YEAH
I AGREE
SO IT'S EITHER UM THE SCROLL WHEEL OR THE PUSH BUTTONS
WELL
IT'D BE IT'D BE COOL BUT THEY ARE SAYING THEY'VE JUST DEVELOPED IT I'M JUST GUESSING
BUT IT'S GONNA BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE OPTION PROBABLY AND
HM
JUST IF YOU ARE REALLY LONELY MAYBE
CHANNEL FIVE
AND THEN IT SWITCHES ON
OKAY SO I'LL GO BACK MAYBE TO THE PREVIOUS SLIDE AND WE CAN DECIDE FOR EACH PROBLEM WHAT WE SHOULD CHOOSE
SO FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE DO WE GO FOR THE BATTERY OR THE
CHEAPER OPTION
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT
OKAY
SO WE'LL GO FOR THE BATTERY
THEN THE CASE DO YOU WANT IT FLAT OR CURVED OR SING OR DOUBLE CURVED
DOUBLE
OKAY SO THEN IF WE USE DOUBLE CURVED CASE THEN WE HAVE TO U CHOOSE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS AND THAT'S FINE
P
YEAH
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD GIVE AN OPTION OF FLAT BUTTONS OR A
THAT THEY DON'T
MM
ALRIGHT THAT'S ME DONE
SORRY
WELL
BLUETOOTH WOULD FOR EXAMPLE ENABLE YOU I THINK TO UM UM CONNECT FOR EXAMPLE YOU IF YOU GET A W CALL ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE
BUT YOUR MOBILE PHONE IS DOWNSTAIRS OR SOMETHING YOU WOULD GET ON YOUR TELEVISION YOU'RE BEING CALLED BY THIS PERSON RIGHT NOW
THINGS LIKE THAT
NO I
NO BUT IF YOU GET BLUETOOTH ON THE REMOTE YOU'D BE ABLE TO
I WITH THE TELEVISION YEAH
I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND AN ADVANTAGE
WHA WHAT W WHAT ADVANTAGE WOULD YOU GET FOR THE
MAYBE THE KINETIC MO PROVISION OF ENERGY THEN
IT'S BEEN DONE FOR WATCHES BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FOR REMOTES YET
CHANGE THE BATTERIES EVER AGAIN
YEAH WELL AND IN LITTLE CHARACTERS YOU SAY YEAH BUT NOT TOO MUCH
YEP
NO VEGETABLES
WELL YEAH BUT APPLE WOULD SUE YOU FOR THAT
SUED THE BEATLES SO
YEAH
WHY NOT
I'M GONNA WRITE THAT DOWN
THAT'S YEAH
ALTHOUGH I'D BE CURIOUS TO SEE HOW MANY UH
YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME COLOURS THAT I WOULDN I WOULD NEVER CHOOSE AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS HOW MANY PEOPLE CHOOSE THAT COLOUR
MM
AND PRODUCE LESS OF THE SILLY COLOURS MAYBE
YEP
ALRIGHT
MM
COOL
IT IS
GREAT
THAT'S TRUE
DOESN'T
YEAH
ARE WE TAKING THESE OFF
HELLO
YEAH
THAT'S THE KIND OF SPAM THAT EVERYBODY LIKES TO RECEIVE
HMM
DO YOU HAVE ANY PREFERENCE UH OF ORDER
I THINK SHE IS STILL FINISHING HER
HMM
OKAY IT'S UH
IS IT LIKE A CRANK THING OR SOMETHING
WELL THERE'S SOMETIMES COMBINATIONS I MEAN LIKE CALCULATORS DO COMBINATIONS OF BATTERY WITH BUT ALSO USING SOME SOLAR POWER
UH I THINK IT HAS TO BE ON THE ON THE SOLAR ENERGY BUT I DON'T KNOW
LET'S HAVE A SQUEEZABLE REMOTE
IF IT'S RUBBER ISN'T IT MALLEABLE ANYWAY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S DOUBLE I MEAN ISN'T A RUBBER CASE
MEAN IT'S COMPLETELY FLEXED I MEAN IT IT FLEXES TO WHATEVER THEY WANT IT TO
MEAN SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NORMAL RUBBER CASE AND A RUBBLE DOUB DOUBLE RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE
OKAY
OKAY
GO RUBBER
GO RUBBER THE WHOLE WAY
I THINK PUSH BUTTONS IS
YEAH
TH THE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION UM OPTION IS IT DOESN'T SEEM REALLY VERY PROMISING FOR US UH 'CAUSE UH
THE YEAH THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY'RE ALREADY USING IT FOR IS WITH THE COFFEE MACHINE WHERE BASICALLY YOU CAN PROGRAM A SAMPLE WI UM
THAT WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING IT WILL GIVE A RESPONSE AND YOU PROGRAM THE RESPONSE AS WELL
JUST UH CLIPS OF THA THAT YOU RECORD YOURSELF
SO YOU CAN PROGRAM YOUR COFFEE MAKER THAT WHEN YOU SAY GOOD MORNING TO IT IT SAYS HELLO RICK OR WHATEVER
BUT I MEAN IT'S NOT IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF IT WAS SPEECH RECOGNITION WHERE YOU SAY SOMETHING AND IT TURNS THE T. V. ON LIKE
TURN THE T. V. ON AND I TURNS COMES ON BUT IT'S NOT THAT
IT JUST GIVES YOU A IT JUST GIVES YOU A VERBAL RESPONSE
SO YEAH I MEAN LIKE WHAT'S THE POINT OF SAYING HELLO REMOTE I MEAN HELLO HOW HOW ARE YOU
YEAH IF YOU'RE REALLY LONELY IT IS IT'S
NO THA THAT W THAT W THAT WOULD BE MORE PROMISING
IT IT'S JUST A REMOTE THAT TALKS TO YOU
UH
I MEAN TO CERTAIN CUES
'KAY
YEAH I'M FINE WITH THE BASIC BATTERY
HMM
YEAH SO WE WANT IT RUB RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED
SO RUBBER RUBBER KEYS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WE'RE GIVING THEM A WAY TO BURN OFF STEAM BASICALLY YEAH
NOT THAT WATCHING T. V. SHOULD BE THAT STRESSFUL
OH YEAH I GUESS T. V. CAN BE STRESSFUL YEAH IF YOU'RE WATCHING SPORTS
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
YEAH SOME OF WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TIES INTO WHAT CATHERINE WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT
OKAY SO I'M CONTINUING WITH THE USER INTERFACE UH TOPIC
AND SO BASICALLY I CONSULTED WITH OUR MANUFACTURING DIVISION
IT SOUNDED LIKE CATHERINE WAS ALSO SPEAKING WITH THEM
UH I ALSO TOOK UH REISSA'S MARKETING FINDINGS FROM THE LAST MEETING INTO CONSIDERATION UM
'CAUSE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S CRUCIAL AS FAR AS UH WHAT KEYS WE'RE GOING TO INC INCLU WHAT BUTTONS WE ARE GOING TO INCLUDE AND AND HOW THEY'RE LAID OUT
UH AND SO THE MANUFACTURING DIVISION UH SENT SOME SOME SAMPLES OF OF UH INTERFACE COMPONENTS THAT WE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN USING THAT HAVE BEEN USED IN OTHER PRODUCTS
UH LIKE THE COFFEE MACHINE
SO I ALREADY MENTIONED THE SPEECH RECOGNITION INTERFACE
I GUESS WE WE BASICALLY VETOED THAT IDEA
IT'S IT'S POINTLESS
UH IT'S JUST A SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE OUTPUT
IT WOULD JUST BE PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART OF OUR REMOTE WITHOUT ANY ACTUAL INTERESTING FUNCTIONALITY AS FAR AS OPERATING THE T. V.
UH SO YEAH
THEY THEY ALSO GIVE THE UH THEY THEY SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF USING A SPINNING WHEEL LIKE YOU USE ON THE SIDE OF AN M. P. THREE PLAYER LIKE IPOD
UM SO WE'VE ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT AND I THINK THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE WORSE FOR SOMETHING LIKE R. S. I. I MEAN YOU GOT THAT THUMB MOVEMENT THAT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY DOING
UM THE OTHER SUGGESTION AND I I HAVE A FEELING THAT
WE'RE INTERESTED IN IN SOMETHING MORE GENERAL BUT THEY SUGGESTED UH YOU KNOW GOING I A LITTLE BIT INTO A A NICHE
LIKE EITHER GEARING OUR REMOTE TOWARDS KIDS WHERE YOU COULD HAVE LOT OF COLOURS UM
THE KEYS MIGHT BE YOU KNOW FUNNY OR OR OR UH SOMETHING FOR THE ELDERLY
WHERE THE REMOTE'S VERY LARGE AND THE BUTTONS ARE VERY LARGE AND THERE'S ONLY A FEW BUTTONS
BUT YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN DISCUSS THIS BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE FROM OUR LAST MEETING WE REALLY WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS GENERAL BUT DONE WELL
UH UM
SO THE KEY LAYOUT AND DESIGN ARE REALLY CRUCIAL
YOU DON'T WANT UH YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO QUICKLY ACCESS THE BUTTONS THAT THEY USE A LOT WITHOUT UH ALWAYS PRESSING THE WRONG ONE UM
AND I DIDN'T MENTION THAT WE NEED A POWER BUTTON IN OUR LAST I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE HERE OF UH GOOD LAYOUT AND BAD LAYOUT
UH
FROM OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT
SO THIS WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF BAD LAYOUT
WHERE YOU HAVE VOLUME UP AND VOLUME DOWN BUT THEY HAVE A V. ON BOTH OF THEM SO UH
IT'S SORT OF CONFUSING FOR THE USER
UH THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF THE GIANT REMOTE THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE
AND FOR SOMETHING FOR KIDS
YEAH
UM
AND SO
YEAH I TH I THINK MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES OF WE'VE ALL KIND OF TALKED ABOUT AND SEEMED TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE UM
UH SO I WAS AGAINST THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND AGAINST GOING UH TOWARDS ANYTHING IN IN A NICHE SENSE
I THINK IT SHOULD BE MORE GENERAL
I DIDN'T I DIDN'T THINK THE SPINNING WHEEL OR THE UH L. C. DISPLAY WERE WERE CRUCIAL FOR US
AND YEAH THAT'S IT FOR ME
SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY SORT OF DISPLAY I THINK UH
SO YEAH IT'S JUST GONNA BE JUST GONNA BE PUSH BUTTONS
UM
I THINK WE SHALL HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF BUTTONS IDEALLY I MEAN A A POWER
CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN AND A NUMERICAL KEYPAD
UH
AND SOME SORT OF IT WILL EITHER HAVE A A LOCK BUTTON LIKE WE MENTIONED OR OR A COVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I GUESS IT'S TO THE POINT WHERE WE NEED TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT
WELL NOW THAT WE'VE DECIDED ON OUR
UM IT SEEMS LIKE WE WOULDN'T WANNA MAKE IT TOO BUSY AND TOO SORT OF GAUDY BUT UM
YEAH I WOULD SAY MAYB MAYBE A COUPLE OF COLOURS LIKE UH LIKE A BLACK WITH WITH YELLOW AND SOMEWHERE
LIKE MAYBE THE R. R. CAN BE YELLOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I I GUESS THE FACT UH ALSO THAT WE ARE HAVING A RUBBER CASE UH WOULD PREVENT US FROM HAVING THE COVER FUNCTION THAT WE THOUGHT OF BEFORE
I MEAN 'CAUSE UH S SO IF WE WANNA HAVE A LOCK OF SOME SORT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A BUTTON
BUT I THINK THAT SHOULD BE I MEAN UM I CAN SPEAK WITH THE BUTTON DEPARTMENT
BUT UH I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO HAVE A BUTTON THAT JUST PREVENTS PREVENTS THE OTHER UH THE OTHER BUTTONS FROM OPERATING
SO THAT SHOULD BE SIMPLE
MM
YEAH
WELL IT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE MAYBE CUTTING EDGE IN SOME SENSE I MEAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S LITTLE MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THAN WHAT'S ON THE MARKET
YEAH
YEAH
ACTUALLY I MEAN THESE FIRST TWO POINTS WE'VE ALREADY SORT OF GONE AWAY FROM
'CAUSE OUR RUBBER ONE IS NOT FANCY I MEAN IT'S DIFFERENT BUT I WOULDN'T SAY LIKE A RUBBER REMOTE IS FANCY
IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT THEN WE MAYBE WE'RE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
AND IT'S IT'S NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE EITHER
MM
SO IS IS THE ADVANTAGE OF BLUETOOTH THAT YOU CAN JUST LIKE SYNCHRONISE IT WITH OTHER
ELECTRONICS
YEAH THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT IT ALLOWS YOU TO DO RIGHT
YEAH THE THAT WOULDN'T BE THE REMOTE SO MUCH I MEAN
MM
YES SO CAN
YEAH WE CAN MAKE THE SQUEEZING OF THE RUBBER BE THE BE THE GENERATING LIKE THE ENERGY GENERATOR
WE'RE ALL ABOUT THAT
OKAY SO WE COULD HAVE KEYS THAT ARE LIKE A B LIKE A BROCCOLI KEY AND A UH AND AN AVOCADO KEY ON THEM
YEAH THAT'S GREAT FOR US
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S GREAT
YEAH I DON'T KNOW HOW WE INCORPORATE
WE DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW EVERY TREND I GUESS
UH-HUH
THE POWER BUTTON COULD BE LIKE A BIG APPLE OR SOMETHING
THEY DON THEY DON'T OWN ALL IMAGES OF APPLES
OKAY WE'LL MAKE IT A UH POMEGRANATE A BIG POMEGRANATE
YEAH
YEAH
MM
SURE
THE ONE THING I'M WONDERING ABOUT
I HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING LIKE TOO MUCH DOWN A GIMMICKY ROAD OF OF HAVING I MEAN IF SOMEBODY GO GOES INTO THE STORE THEY'RE GONNA SEE LIKE THREE OR FOUR NORMAL REMOTES
AND THEN A BIG SPONGY PINK T TOMATO UH REMOTE
I MEAN WHAT ARE NINETY PER CENT OF PEOPLE GONNA TAKE
MM
YEAH I MEAN THAT THAT SEEMS TO WORK WELL WITH FOR PRODUCTS LIKE IPOD WHERE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF COLOURS
THAT PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE CUSTOMISING IT WHEN THEY BUY IT EVEN YOU KNOW JUST JUST BY THE FACT OF CHOOSING
RIGHT
YEAH
OKAY
OH RIGHT
YEAH
THAT SOUNDS GOOD
MM
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
MM I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW
OKAY
OKAY I'LL STAY IN HERE
DOES THE PAY RAISE IMMEDIATELY COME INTO EFFECT ON OUR NEXT PAY CHECK OR IS THAT
SO WE'RE BUYING FUT I MEAN WE'RE GETTING FUTURES IN THE COMPANY
SO WE REALLY HAVE A INCENTIVE TO MAKE THIS REMOTE WORK
I'D LIKE TO SHARE IN THE COFFEE MACHINE PROFITS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY DOING WELL
YEAH
THIS COMPANY HAS ITS ITS FINGERS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT POTS
YEAH WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT IN THE MONEY MAKING DEPARTMENT
WELL I I DID NOTICE LOOKING AT I MEAN
THEY TOLD YOU THAT THEY WANTED WHATEV OUR PRODUCT TO REPRESENT THE THE R. R. BRAND AND AND TO BE IMMEDIATELY NOTICEABLE
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK LIKE AT THE COFFEE MAKER AT THE AT THE CORPORATE WEB PAGE IT'S NOT OBVIOUS
R. R.
WELL IT IS TO US BECAUSE WE WE WORKED WORKED HERE FOR YEARS AND WE USE THAT COFFEE MACHINE
BUT IT'S DOESN'T HAVE THE COLOUR SCHEME OF OF THE OF THE COMPANY ANYWHERE ON IT OBVIOUSLY IT'S JUST SIL SILVER AND BLACK
NO
MM
OKAY
RIGHT WELL I GUESS THAT'S US
OKAY
RIGHT
OH RIGHT OKAY
I COVER MYSELF UP
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED ONE OF THESE I REALLY HAVE
WHERE DO YOU BUY 'EM FROM
THEY'RE
YEAH
OH MY GOSH
MM-HMM
BATTERIES
IT'S HERE
AH
MM
MM
MM
YEAH
MM
I THINK RUBBER'S
BUT AFTER MY AFTER MY FASHION THING I THINK YOU'LL REALISE THAT RUBBER IS MORE
PEOPLE
WHAT ABOUT THE JUST DEVELOPED UH SAMPLE SENSOR
G THERE THE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER THING
MM I DUNNO
BE COOL
CHANNEL TWO
OH IT JUST GIVES AN ANSWER
OH THEN THEN
I THOUGHT I THOUGHT IT WAS WHEN THEY SAID
I THOUGHT WHEN THEY SAID VOICE RECOGNITION THEY MEANT UM LIKE CHANNEL FIVE AND IT WILL CHANGE
LIKE YOU TALK TO IT
CAN I HAVE CHANNEL FIVE
OH THEN FORGET ABOUT IT
OH RIGHT OKAY
MM
MM
YEAH
SO IT WILL LOOK LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
YEAH
WELL THE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS
DON'T YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR
MM
MM
YEAH THE RUBBER'S GOOD
YEAH SO THEY CAN SIT THERE AND GO LIKE
MM
MM
THAT DOES GET ANNOYING
UH-HUH
WELL
MAYBE WE CAN
RIGHT
WELL I'M JUST BASICALLY LETTING YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKETS
AND WHAT THE FASHIONS ARE FOR NEXT YEAR
UM
SO YES SO FROM LOOKING AT THIS YEAR'S TRENDS AND FASHIONS AND ALSO RECENT INVESTIGATION THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET
WE HAVE FOUND THAT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET THESE ARE LIKE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS LIKE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO WHICH WE'VE ALREADY PROBABLY DISCUSSED
UM THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS LOOK AND FEEL
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO LOOK AND FEEL FANCIER THAN THE ONES THAT ALREADY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE
SO IT HAS TO BE
YEP
EXACTLY
UM SECOND UH IT SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE INNOVATIVE
SO
TECHNOLOGICALLY IT SHOULD BE LIKE UM WORK BASICALLY I GUESS
IT SHOULD WORK
SHOULD
THAT'S NEW
YEAH
YEAH
MM
SO NO LOOSE
THAT'S WHY I WAS THINKING BLUETOOTH 'CAUSE IF YOU LIKE PUT UP BLUETOOTH AND IT'S LIKE A BLUETOOTH REMOTE CONTROL
EVERYBODY'S GONNA LIKE OH 'CAUSE BLUETOOTH IS THE IN THING NOWADAYS
LIKE IT REALLY IS LIKE PEOPLE AND UM WHEN IT COMES TO MARKETING LIKE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE GO FOR THEY DON'T REALLY CARE WHETHER YOU KNOW
AT THE END OF THE DAY WHETHER IT WORKS PROPERLY OR NOT
WELL THEY DO BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S NOT
YEAH BUT IT LOOKS GOOD
IF IT LOOKS GOOD AND IT'S IT CAN JUST BE THERE FOR DECORATION
BUT LIKE
YOU COULD ALWAYS INSERT YEAH
YEAH BUT I MEAN PEOPLE LIKE
WELL IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT IF YOU LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE
YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT NEW YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT STATE OF THE ART
WELL IT DOESN'T
LIKE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW BLUETOOTH THAT WAS JUST AN IDEA
BUT LIKE IT NEEDS DO SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IS NEW
WHETHER IT'S A BATTERY IT COULD BE SOMETHING REALLY
REALLY MINOR YOU KNOW LIKE BUT I THINK WE ARE REALLY KEEPING TO WHAT IS ALREADY OUT THERE
AND PEOPLE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT PEOPLE'VE ALREADY GOT IT
IF WE WANT SOMETHING NEW WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE
AND UM JUST GO CREATIVE
AND THEN YOU CAN MARKET IT
NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE A BATTERY AGAIN
I THINK SAFETY S
YEAH
THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT UH IS IT'S EASY TO USE
AND I THINK WE'VE ALL UM WORKED THAT OUT
UM OKAY IN THE FASHION HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK
NEXT YEAR'S FASHION I VERY MUCH IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE THM ARE LIKE THE THEME FOR CLOTHS SHOES AND FURNITURE
SO NEXT YEAR PEOPLE WILL BE BUYING I FOUND THIS REALLY FUNNY YOU KNOW STRAWBERRY SHAPED CHAIRS
AND THINGS
YEAH
RUBBER THINGS
UM AND AS IT'S RUBBER THE FEEL WHICH IS IN THIS YEAR IS SPONGY
SO IT'S IT'S NOT QUITE SPONGY BUT SPONGY I WOULD SAY IS YEAH SO WE'RE IN
YEAH
AND SO PERSONAL WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING LIKE MOVE AWAY FROM THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS UH LIKE THE LOOK AND THE FEEL OF THE CURRENT ONES AND CHANGE THE LOOK AND FEEL
WHILE STILL KEEPING TO THE COMPANY'S IMAGE BASICALLY
SO YEAH
I HAD TO SAY
SO WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION LIKE
MM
MAYBE MAKE IT LIKE FRUITY COLOURS OR SOMETHING
SOME SORT
OR
MM
WELL
I THINK IF IT'S RUBBER
IT NEEDS TO BE
DIFFERENT
I THINK IT'S IT SHOULD BE I MEAN WHAT DO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH RUBBER
YOU KNOW LIKE
REALLY DIFFERENT COLOURS BASICALLY
OKAY SOR I SORRY I USED THE WRONG WORD WHAT DO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH THE MATE THE MATERIAL THAT MATERIAL
UM UM LIKE I'M JUST THINKING BRIGHT COLOURS
BRIGHT NATURAL COLOURS NOTHING
TOO
BRIGHT BUT TOO NOT YEAH
LIKE NO LIME GREEN OR BRIGHT YELLOW OR BRIGHT PINK
WANNA MAKE IT DIFFERENT COLOURS SO ANYBODY CAN CHOO LIKE LIKE
YEAH
AND ON THE BACK OF IT HAVE THE LOGO
WELL
I CAN SAY IN THIS COUNTRY YOU'LL GET YOU KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE WANTING SOMETHING REALLY FUNKY AND COOL
LIKE AND KIDS WILL BE WALKING IN WITH THEIR PARENTS SAYING MUMMY I WANNA BUY THAT ONE
AND UH PARENTS WILL SEE THE WILL SEE THE PRO AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S UM
LIKE KIDS WON'T BREAK IT IT'S NOT BREAKABLE IF YOU THROW IT AROUND
ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNGER KIDS YOU KNOW THEY CAN PICK IT UP AND AND
YEAH
THE ONLY THING IS IS THAT REALLY SMALL KIDS MIGHT CHEW ON IT BUT
YEAH
SO SO IT'S REA IT'S QUITE IT'S QUITE LIKE UM USER FRIENDLY AND ALSO FOR DIFFERENT FAMILIES
LIKE LIKE FAMILY USE AS WELL SO FOR LITTLE KIDS AND FOR OLD KI LIKE TEENAGERS WILL LIKE IT I THINK
ESPECIALLY MAYBE YOUNGER GIRLS IF IT'S IN PINK THEY'LL BE LIKE PINK REMOTE CONTROL FOR THEIR ROOM SOMETHING
YEAH
SO LIKE YOU WALK IN YOU'RE LIKE OH I LIKE THAT REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S SO BRIGHT AND THEN
AND THEN THE SHOP ASSISTANT COMES UP AND SAYS OH WHAT COLOUR WOULD YOU LIKE
AND THEN THEY GO LIKE OH I CAN CHOOSE THE COLOUR WOW
SO IT PUTS I THINK EVEN THE CUSTOMER INTO MORE CONTROL OVER WHAT THEY'RE BUYING INSTEAD OF YOU'VE GOT ALL COLOUR IT'S EITHER THAT OR NOTHING
SO THEY ALSO GET TO PICK
WELL PERSONALLY I LIKE WALKING INTO A SHOP AND CHOOSING A COLOUR
IT'S UM
YEAH
MM
D YOU'VE GOT THE
EVALUATION
MM
YEAH
S
THIS GIVES YOU ALL THE DETAILS
UM
YEAH
MM
MM
PLAY DOH'S EDIBLE
DID YOU KNOW THAT
IT'S DEFINITELY
YEAH
IT'S IT'S CHEW PROOF
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
EVERYBODY EVERYBODY READY
OKAY LET'S HAVE YOUR UM LET'S GET HAVE THE UH PRESENTATION
NICE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WHAT BUTTON
UM
OH MUTE
OKAY
THAT CERTAINLY DOES
MM
MM
YEAH
'S GREAT
I HAVE ONE THING ABOUT IT BUT IT'S A SMALL THING BUT IT'D MEAN WE'D HAVE TO MAKE A RIGHT HANDED ONE AND A LEFT HANDED ONE
BUT THAT'S I DON'T SEE WHY THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE
YEAH
THEY MAKE LEFT HANDED SCISSORS YOU KNOW
YES S
MM
SURE
SURE
YEAH
YEAH
BUT UM OTHER THAN THAT I MEAN UH AND THAT'S UM YOU KNOW
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I THINK I THINK IT'S GREAT YEAH GREAT IDEA
I THINK IT'S WELL IF THE R. R. MOTTO IS WE BRING FASHION TO TO ELECTRONICS I'D SAY THAT COULD BE QUITE FASHIONABLE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH VERY GOOD YEAH
IT'S COME UP WITH WHAT WE'VE YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT'S WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT DOING HASN'T IT ALL SEEMS TO BE THERE
WELL DONE
UM BEFORE WE MOVE ON
I NEED THAT CABLE
THANK YOU
YEAH
UM
ONE THING I DO NEED TO DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT IS THE COSTS
WELL YEAH
UM
YEAH
UH RIGHT
OKAY NOW I THINK WE'LL DO THIS I COULD DO YOU KNOW I CAN DO THIS O ON MY OWN OR I COULD DO IT WITH YOU
BUT IT'S JUST EASY ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH IT WITH YOU SO WE'RE GOING FOR THE KINETIC POWER
AND THE ELECTRONICS WE DECIDED ON IT BEING JUST A SIMPLE THE EASIEST
THING THAT'S INSIDE IT
OOH
SO THE CASE WE'VE GONE FOR THE DOUBLE CURVED
UM
AND IT'S MADE OUT OF RUBBER
THE INTERFACE IS PUSH BUTTONS
AND BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS WELL THEY'RE IN DIFF SPECIAL COLOURS AREN'T THEY
SO SPECIAL COLOURS
SPECIAL FORM YEAH THEY'RE A SPECIAL FORM THERE IN SHAPES AND STUFF
YEP
YEAH
UM
ARE THEY MADE OUT OF ANY SPECIAL MATERIAL
NO THEY'RE NOT
THEY'RE NOT MADE OUT OF WOOD OR TITANIUM OR RUBBER OR ANYTHING THEY'RE JUST SIMPLE
OKAY
RIGHT
SO LET'S SEE IF THAT COMES WITHIN BUDGET
AND IT DOES
THAT IS GONNA COST UH YEAH
THAT'S GONNA COST TEN TEN EURO SEVENTY CENTS A UNIT TO MAKE
AND OUR TARGET WAS IT HAD TO COME IN AT UNDER TWELVE FIFTY
SO
THIS IS ALL VERY VERY GOOD
THE BOSSES WILL BE VERY PLEASED
OKAY LET'S JUST SAVE THIS SO I CAN E MAIL IT TO YOU
UH
SAVE IT IN SAVE IT IN THE UH MY DOCUMENTS
SPLENDID
OKAY
SO UH THAT'S DONE WITH THIS WITH THIS UM DOODAH SO YOU'RE
GONNA DO WHAT YOU WERE GONNA DO
YOUR EVALUATION
F. EIGHT
I LOVE THE SMELL OF THAT PLAY DOH
I COU
I WOULD GIVE IT A SEVEN
OH SORRY ONE D YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGICAL THING THAT'S ANOTHER THING I THAT'S ANOTHER MARKETING THING
SO ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF IT IT
EASY TO USE
I'D SAY IT'S I WOULDN'T NOT IF YOU'RE LEFT HANDED IT'S NOT
I WOULD GIVE IT A I WOULD GIVE IT A TWO
'CAUSE I I IT I IT I IT IS MORE GEARED FOR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE THAN LEFT HANDED PEOPLE BUT
YEAH
GIVE IT A T GIVE IT A TWO
COST
IT'S COME IN UNDER BUDGET
SO THAT'S A DEFINITE ONE
AMOUNT OF BUTTONS
CONTAINS ONLY THE NECESSARY BUTTONS
YEAH
SO IT'S ANTI R. S. I.
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA GET LOST EASILY
TWO
I MEAN IT
NO I MEAN
I MEAN YOU COULD STILL FLUSH IT DOWN THE TOILET THEORETICALLY BUT
OKAY
ALRIGHT IT'S ALL ALL SYSTEMS GO
WE CAN'T FAIL
WELL DONE REISSA
OKAY I I THINK UM I JUST WANNA PUT IN AS PROJECT MANAGER THE YOU KNOW
LITTLE BIT OF PRAISE FOR EVERYBODY HERE FOR HOW THEY'VE WORKED ON IT YOU KNOW BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A TEAM
YOU KNOW YOU'VE W EVERYONE'S COME UP WITH THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL IDEAS IN THEIR OWN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS UM AND THEN COME TOGETHER AND WORKED IN
YOU KNOW INTEGRALLY YOU KNOW AT THE RIGHT TIMES PSP YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY YOU TWO
THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW GONE VERY VERY WELL AND AND AND BE YOU KNOW HAS BEEN GOOD COMMUNICATION GOING ON
DID YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE THE CORPORATE SQUASH COURT AND BASH A FEW BALLS ABOUT
FANTASTIC
I THINK SO I I YOU KNOW AND I THINK WE'VE CO WE HAVE COME WE'VE COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW
SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE WE HAVEN'T WE'RE NOT JUST REHASHING AN OLD DESIGN
YEAH
YOU KNOW MAYBE THIS ISN'T A SIMULATION MAYBE THIS IS ACTUALLY SO IT'S LIKE SONY OR SOMEONE LIKE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST YEAH THEY GET
YEAH
YEAH TWO YEARS' TIME THIS WILL BE ON THE MARKET
EX EXACTLY THAT PRODUCT UM THUM WE'LL GO YEAH WE DESIGNED THAT AND NO ONE WILL BELIEVE US
BUT UM
NO I THINK WHEN THIS MEETING'S FINISHED LIKE OFFICIALLY THERE B WE'LL GET A UH QUESTIONNAIRE TO FILL IN
OR SIX UH
I HAVEN'T GOT MESSAGE
IT GETS HANDED OVER TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT
WHAT OUR WHAT OUR PROJECT WAS WAS TO COME UP WITH THE PRODUCT BASICALLY
THE FOR THE AND JUST BASICALLY IS IT IT COME CAN IS IT WITHIN BUDGET
WHEN IT C WHEN IT COMES TO ALL THE OTHER THINGS OF HOW TO SELL IT AND YOU KNOW
THE B THE PROFITS AND ALL THAT THAT'S OTHER DEPARTMENTS IT'S ANOTHER TEAM THAT ACTUALLY WORK OUT THE MAI THE OH YEAH
THE ALL THE GUYS IN THE PROFIT SHARING YEAH
UM
YEAH THAT'S IT
YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE MADE I WE'VE MADE WE'VE DESIGNED THE PRODUCT WE'VE MA WE'VE GOT THE PROTOTYPE
IT'S WITHIN BUDGET IT'S DOES EVERYTHING THAT WE WANTED IT TO DO
IT'S NEW IT'S IT'S UM
SOMETHING THAT UH THAT ISN'T OUT THERE ALREADY
YEAH
WELL THIS IS VERY MARKETABLE IN THAT IT IS IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF NEW AND LOOKS A BIT QUIRKY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT THAT
IT'S THAT IT'S UM HANG ON I WROTE IT DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE
OH NO I THI I PUT IT IN ONE OF MY E MAILS THAT I SENT OFF
UM THAT YOU KNOW IT'S MARKETABLE IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S WHILST ALL THESE OTHER REMOTES UH ACTUALLY DO GIVE YOU REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
OUR ONE DOES THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE YOU KNOW SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NEW
WHICH IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA THEY ASKED US TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING WITH SOMETHING NEW
YEAH AND IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH THE T. V. YOU CAN F THROW IT ABOUT YOU KNOW
IT'S FINE IT'S KID PROOF
WELL YOU CAN BREAK THE ORNAMENTS BUT YOU WON'T BREAK THAT
YEAH
SO ALL IN ALL I THINK WE'VE DONE VERY WELL
WELL DONE EVERYBODY
UM
DRINKS ARE ON THE COMPANY
IN THE CORPORATE BAR THAT'S NEXT TO THE CORPORATE SWIMMING POOL ON THE TOP FLOOR THAT WE'RE THAT'VE ALL JUST GAINED ACCESS TO
YEAH
THAT'S IT
WELL AS FAR AS I T AS FAR AS I KNOW
UM
NO
ANYONE WANNA PLAY I SPY
YEAH I GUESS
I MEAN WE'RE GONNA GET ASKED TO FILL OUT ANOTHER QUESTIONNAIRE
UM
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE SAME AS ONE WE'VE DONE BEFORE
BUT I'M NOT THE AUTHORITY TO SAY THAT IT IS
UM HOW DOES EVERYONE FEEL ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN USED IN THIS
THE SORT OF USING OF THE THE PENS AND WRITING ON THESE SPECIAL PADS AND ALL THAT
YEAH
I THI YOU KNOW I'D I'D N YEAH AS WE SAID EARLIER I'VE NOT NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE
SOMETHING THAT T THE WHITEBOARD
THINGY THAT'S GREAT
UM BUT A P A PEN WITH A CAMERA ON IT I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A NEW THING
I MEAN IT'S I OR IN SUCH A NEW IDEA
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF IT WAS SORT OF HAND WRITING RECOGNITION STUFF
BUT AS IT'S NOT IT'S LITERALLY THAT'LL COME UP ON A COMPUTER SCREEN AS A PICTURE FILE RATHER THAN ACTUAL TEXT
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I USED TO EAT IT
YEP
WE'VE GOT A COOL PROTOTYPE
DOUBLE CURVED
WHICH IS ANT ANTI R. S. I.
OH RIGHT YEAH
YEAH
I KNOW I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT HANDED AND RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE IN THE FAMILY AND THEY ALL USE THE COMPUTER FOR THE WHOLE THE SAME COMPUTER THE FES FAMILY AND THEY HAVE A MOUSE
AND EVERYBODY IS USING RIGHT HANDED MOUSE
IMAGINE D ARE YOU RIGHT HANDED
IMAGINE YOU'RE DOING IT WITH YOUR LEFT HAND I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO
BUT WE CAN HAVE BOTH UH
YEAH
I THINK IT DOES
YEAH
THERE YOU GO
PLAY DOH IS VERY CHEAP
CHEW PROOF
OH HO HO
YEP
RUBBER
YEAH
MM-HMM
A ONE
WELL THE KINETIC THING YEAH
WELL SO THE UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
TRUE
TWO
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YES S YEAH
IT'S YELLOW
TWO
T
MM
MM
WE'VE WE'VE DONE WELL
WELL
YOU KNOW
IT IS
Y
OH REALLY
MM YEP
COOL
GLAD TO HEAR THAT
YEAH
YEAH
I'VE I'VE DEFINITELY EATEN IT BEFORE
I DIDN'T KNOW WAS EDIBLE
ACTUALLY THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I REMEMBER LIKE
PEOPL I DUNNO IF MY MOM EVER DID IT BUT I REMEMBER OTHER PEOPLE'S MOMS MAKING LIKE HOME MADE PLAY DOH WHERE YOU JUST LIKE MAKE THE COLOURING AND MAKE SOME SORT OF SORT OF DOUGH
MM-HMM
YEAH
WE'VE GOT SOME
YEAH IT'S PRETTY EXCITING
SO
EVERYTHING UH THAT WE WANTED WE WANTED IT TO BE ERGONOMIC AND TO BE MADE OUT OF RUBBER VERY SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE YEAH
DOUBLE CURVED UM BUT ALSO SOMETHING THAT WAS GONNA JUMP OUT AT PEOPLE
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT UH SEPARATE IT FROM THE OTHER REMOTES OUT ON THE MARKET
SO UH I THINK IF YOU PUT THIS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND YOU'LL SEE WHAT A NICE THING WE HAVE GOING HERE
SO BASICALLY
IF YOU HOLD IT LIKE THAT THE ONE ON YOUR THUMB YEAH THE THUMB BUTTON IS THE POWER BUTTON
YOUR INDEX FINGER IS CHANNEL UP MIDDLE FINGER IS CHANNEL DOWN RING FINGER IS VOLUME UP YOUR PINKIE IS VOLUME DOWN
THAT'S THE LOCK BUTTON HAS A L. L. ON IT AND THEN THE M. IS A MUTE BUTTON
AND THEN IT ALSO HAS DIGIT
FOR MUTING THE UH
UM AND THEN THEN YOU CAN ALSO THERE'S A NUMERIC KEYPAD ON THE TOP SO YOU CAN KEY DIRECTLY TO THE TO THE CHANNEL IF YOU WANT
SO IT'S REALLY BASIC FUNCTIONALITIES AS FAR AS WHAT KEYS ARE AVAILABLE BUT WE THINK IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE AND VERY INNOVATIVE AND IT LOOKS DIFFERENT
SO ALL THE I MEAN THE IMPORTANT KEYS ARE RIGHT AT YOUR F F YOU KNOW RIGHT AT UH AT A CONVENIENT PLACE FOR YOU TO TO ACCESS THEM
SO YOU DON'T YOU
YEAH
IT SHOULD BE
AND IT'S ALSO CONFORMABLE TO THE SIZE OF YOUR HAND
I MEAN IF THAT'S TOO BIG IT'S A RUBBER REMOTE SO YOU CAN YOU KNOW
CHANGE THAT
SO D DOES THAT UH WHAT MESH WITH WHAT YOU GUYS WERE HOPING AND FOR AND EXPECTING OR DOES IT
AH THAT'S GOOD THINKING YEAH
YEAH IF WE BUILD ROCKET SHIPS WHY CAN'T WE BUILD LEFT HANDED AND RIGHT HANDED UH REMOTES
YEAH I DIDN'T I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I'D YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
DO YOU THINK IT SAYS R. R.
FASHION TO ELECTRONICS
YEAH
YEAH
AND IT'S GOT THE B THE BLACK AND YELLOW AND BLUE
PLUS RED WHICH IS SORT OF A A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE UH UH
SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR END OF THINGS WHA UH
THAT'S
YEAH
THE COSTS WAS THAT WHAT YOU SAID
BUT IT'S EDIBLE
THAT WAS THE MAIN CRITERIA FROM THE LAST MEETING IT HAD TO BE CHEW PROOF
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN THESE THESE ONES ON THE SIDE ARE CURVED KIND OF SO
THE BUTTONS ARE RUBBER
THAT'S COOL
YEAH
YEAH
AND WE'RE ACTUA ACTUALLY MAKING A BETTER PROFIT THAN WE EXPECTED
YEAH HAVE SOME HAVE SOME
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
OH SORRY ONE
YEAH
THAT WAS OUR MAIN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION W EVERY EVERYTHING ELSE WAS FAIRLY SIMPLE BUT THE FACT THAT WE USED THE KINETIC ENERGY WAS NEW
IT'S ERGONOMIC BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S THAT'S A DESIGN THAT'S A DES THAT'S A DESIGN THING YEAH
IT'S ABOUT IN THE MID IN THE MIDDLE SOMEWHERE MAYBE YEAH I DUNNO
MAYBE THREE YEAH
YEAH
MM
OKAY
IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE ONE LEFT HANDED AND ONE RIGHT HANDED THEN I WOULD GIVE IT A ONE BUT OTHERWISE OTHERWISE A TWO
YEAH
THAT WAS GREAT
YEAH
IT IS VERY BRIGHT YEAH
IT'S NOT THE KINDA THING THAT'S GONNA SLIP LIKE BETWEEN A COUCH CUSHION OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW
MAYBE IT WILL
UH
YOU THINK IT COULD LOST
MM
OKAY
YEAH ANYTHING I MEAN
OKAY
IT'S BIGGER THAN THE AVERAGE MOBILE I GUESS
BUT YEAH IT CAN GET LOST
YEAH
OKAY YEAH TWO IS FINE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH DURING OUR DESIGN I MEAN THERE WAS SOME S SOME HEATED HEATED DISCUSSION BUT WE WE KEPT WE TRIED TO KEEP IT COOL AND AND
JUST JUST
WE JUST HAD TO WE JUST HAD TO SQUEEZE OUR PRODUCT A LITTLE BIT AND
NOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN A A GREAT TEAM
THINK WE'RE THE WE'RE THE ENVY OF ALL THE OF ALL THE OTHER R. R. TEAMS
YEAH I THINK THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO FIND IDEAS FOR A IDEAL REMOTE
SO AT THIS STAGE I MEAN IS THIS THE LAST MEETING OF THE PROJECT
WE DON'T UH HAVE ANOTHER ONE AFTER IT'S GONE GONE TO MARKE MARKET OR SOMETHING
SO THERE'S NO WAY TO LIKE PREDICT WHAT OUR 'CAUSE WE HAD A WE ORIGINALLY HAD A
AS FAR AS OUR FINANCIAL UH UM GOALS WE HAD A SPECIFIC NUMBER FOR PROFITS THAT WE WANTED
IT WAS FIFTY MIL FIFTY MILLION
I DON'T REMEMBER
BUT THERE'S NOT A WAY TO COMPUTE THAT I MEAN SINCE WE SAVED ON THE ON THE PRODUCTION COST
DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE MAKING ON PROFIT
UH
HMM
BUT WE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST PROF PROFIT SHARING
I THINK ACTUALLY AND ONE ADVANTAGE OF OF THIS IS THAT AFTER THE UH YOU KNOW
AFTER THIS FAD OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES PASSES THIS WILL STILL BE C A COOL REMOTE YOU KNOW
WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW TYING TYING OUR CART TO THAT ONE HORSE
MM
MM
MM
IT MAKE WATCHING T. V. HEALTHY
UH
RIGHT YOU TOO
MM
THAT'S IT
I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAT WE WRAP IT UP THAN HAVE FIVE MINUTES OF
SILENCE
SHOULD WE CALL THE DAY THEN
UH RIGHT
MM-HMM
YOUR MOMENT TO SHINE
RIGHT I THINK THEY DO WANT TO DO HAND WRITING RECOGNITION ON THAT IT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP
I GUESS WE SHOULD END THIS SINCE WE'RE OFF OFF TOPIC
SO
SHALL WE
RIGHT
IT'S PLAY DOH
BECAUSE KIDS YEAH
BUT UM IT'S IT'S MADE EDIBLE 'CAUSE YEAH
IT'S MADE EDIBLE 'CAUSE KIDS EAT IT AND IF IT'S WASN'T EDIBLE THEN
WELL NORMAL BABIES
OH YEAH IT IS YEAH
OH YEAH
THAT IS COOL
WHAT'S THE BIG BLUE THING
OH COOL
AND MUTE
OH IT'S SO CUTE
YEAH BUT THEN
BUT THEN YOU CAN LEARN TO USE YOUR RIGHT H LIKE I WAS JUST THINKING IF THERE'S LEFT HANDERS AND RIGHT HANDERS IN THE FAMILY WHAT THEY HAVE TWO REMOTES
YEAH I'M SURE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO
I MEAN IT'S ONLY PRESSING BUTTONS YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING YOU KNOW EXTRAORDINARY
I THINK EVERYBODY CAN PRESS A BUTTON WITH THEIR LEFT AND RIGHT HAND SO
YEAH IT'S NOT
YEAH
HAVE THEM IN STOCK
MAKE 'EM MORE APPEALING AS WELL
AND ALL THE PLAYING AROUND IS UH
YEAH I'M JUST DO YOU WANNA PLUG IN
OKAY
MM
PLAY DOH WON'T LAST VERY LONG EVERYBODY'LL GO LIKE OOPS IT'S GONE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL THEY'LL BUY MORE OF THEM IF YOU EAT THEM
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S BETTER FOR
AND SPECIAL MATERIAL
WELL THEY'RE RUBBER AREN'T THEY
WE'RE UNDER BUDGET
IT'S ALREADY SAVED I THINK
THANK YOU
MM
OH YEAH
THIS IS WHERE WE ALL GET TO I GET TO WRITE ON THE OOPS ON THE BOARD
RIGHT
OH
'S FUNCTION
OKAY
MM
OKAY
SO EVALUATION
WE'RE GONNA DO IT ALL TOGETHER SO WE EVALUATE EACH CRITERIA
I'VE GOT THE CRITERIAS
AND WE HAVE TO DO IT ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN ONE BEING TRUE
SO IT'S IT'S MORE LIKE IT'S FITS THE CRITERIA AND SEVEN BEING AS IN IT DOESN'T FIT THE CRITERIA
AND THE CRITERIAS ARE AND I'LL DRAW THIS UP ON THE BOARD SO WE HAVE A BOX
AND THIS IS FALSE THIS IS JUST LIKE
TO KEEP YOU INFORMED
SO SEVEN'S HERE AND ONE'S HERE AND THEN YOU'VE GOT IN THE MIDDLE
SO THE FIRST CRITERIA
DO YOU ALL GET WHAT WE'RE DOING
OKAY COOL
OKAY FIRST CRITERIA LOOK AND FEEL
SO THE DOES REMOTE LOOK AND FEEL FASHIONABLE TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
AS IT IS IT COLOUR WISE AND IS IT SPONGY
SO WHAT MARK SHOULD WE GIVE FOR THAT
AS IN IT'S NOT
A ONE A ONE
SO I'LL JUST WRITE CRITERIA CRITERIA ONE WE GET ONE
SECOND CRITERIA NEW TECHNOLOGY
HAVE WE IMPLEMENTED NEW TECHNOLOGY
AS IN THE NEW HIGH TECH
SO IT'S
SO WE'LL GIVE IT A
YEAH
I'D SAY IT'S ABOUT A A TWOISH
TWO
THREE
THREE
SO CRITERIA THREE IS IS IT EASY TO USE
I THINK IT'S A ONE I THINK
TWO SO IT'S
BUT IF WE MAKE A RIGHT HANDED AND A LEFT HANDED THEN
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
'KAY CRITERIA FOUR IS COSTS
'S GREAT
YEAH
LIKE THE AMOUNT OF BUTTONS 'CAUSE PEOPLE LIKE A LOT LE LIKE
SO IT'S A ONE
UM CRITERIA SIX
R. S. I. IS IT GOOD AGAINST
YES
VERY GOOD
IT'S ONE
AND CRITERIA SEVEN WHICH IS THE LAST ONE DOES IT GET LOST
IS IT EASY TO GET LOST
NO
BUT IT IS SMALLISH
MM
I THINK I IT WOULD COULD BE COULD GET LOST
MM
YEAH
I MEAN IT'S NOT FULLY IT'S NOT FULLY LIKE YOU CAN'T SAY I MEAN IT'S NOT A ONE DEFINITELY
YEAH
THE MOBILES GET LOST ALL THE TIME
BUT THEN YOU RING 'EM AND YOU FIND THEM
SO
YEAH
SO THAT'S THAT
SO THAT'S THE EVALUATION SO I'D SAY
YAY
IT'S LIKE LIKE A NUMBER ONE
UM
NUMBER ONE PRODUCT
ALL DONE THANKS
WE FITTED ALL THE CRITERIAS
YEAH
YEAH SO
SO THAT'S THAT ONE
BEEN COOL
IN FOUR DIFF IN IN FOUR MEETINGS
FUNNY ALL DESIGNER MEETINGS COULD BE THIS QUICK
THEY'RE USING OUR IDEAS
YEAH
JUST START SUMMARISING NOW
YOU CAN REPLY TO THE SAME MESSAGE
SEE SUMMARY THERE
IF YOU JUST REPLY TO THAT ONE
WAS IT WAS IT FIFTY OR FIVE
DEPENDS HOW MUCH WE SELL
WE FINISHED AN HOUR EARLIER
MM
MM
DEFINITELY
YEAH
JUST DON'T SH DON'T THROW IT AT ANY OF THE ORNAMENTS AND BREAK THEM
NO
YAY
YEP
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE FIVE MINUTE LEFT THING YET
MM MM
IN PROJECT
I LOVE IT
I LOVE IT
I THINK IT'S COOL
BEING ALL WIRED UP AND A VIBRATING PEN AND IT'S COOL
BEING WATCHED
UM
WOW
MM
LOGITECH
YEAH
MEETING ADJOURNED
OKAY
GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY
UM I'M GLAD YOU COULD ALL COME
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO START THIS TEAM
UM I'M JUST GONNA HAVE A LITTLE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION FOR US FOR OUR KICK OFF MEETING
MY NAME IS ROSE LINDGREN
I I'LL BE THE PROJECT MANAGER
UM OUR AGENDA TODAY IS WE ARE GONNA DO A LITTLE OPENING AND THEN I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT
THEN WE'LL MOVE INTO ACQUAINTANCE SUCH AS GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT INCLUDING A TOOL TRAINING EXERCISE
AND THEN WE'LL MOVE INTO THE PROJECT PLAN DO A LITTLE DISCUSSION AND CLOSE SINCE WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES
FIRST OF ALL OUR PROJECT AIM
UM WE ARE CREATING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WHICH WE HAVE THREE GOALS ABOUT IT NEEDS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE ALL THREE OF THOSE
UM SO WE'RE GONNA DIVIDE US UP INTO THREE COMPA THREE PARTS
FIRST THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN WHICH WILL BE UH FIRST WE'LL DO INDIVIDUAL WORK COME INTO A MEETING THE CONCEPTIONAL DESIGN
INDIVIDUAL WORK AND A MEETING AND THEN THE DETAILED DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK AND A MEETING
SO THAT WE'LL EACH BE DOING OUR OWN IDEAS AND THEN COMING TOGETHER AND UM COLLABORATING
OKAY WE'RE GONNA GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT
SO UM WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS START OFF WITH UM LET'S START OFF WITH AMINA
UM ALIMA SORRY ALIMA
UM WE'RE GONNA DO A LITTLE TOOL TRAINING SO WE ARE GONNA WORK WITH THAT WHITEBOARD BEHIND YOU
UM INTRODUCE YOURSELF UM SAY ONE THING ABOUT YOURSELF AND THEN DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND TELL US ABOUT IT
PROBABLY BOTH
HOW DO YOU SPELL YOUR NAME
THANKS
SO WHAT ARE YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS
MM
EXCELLENT
SHALL WE JUST GO AROUND THE TABLE
MM
MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE THEM ALL UP THERE AT SAME TIME
EM
MM 'KAY
MM 'KAY
I'M ROSE AND I'M PROJECT MANAGER FROM CALIFORNIA
UM
HMM
S
UM IT'S ACTUALLY A COYOTE
LET'S SEE
LET'S SEE LET'S GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A SNOUT I DON'T KNOW SOME TEETH
YEAH
OH DEAR
YES
I LIVE UM I LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM AN OPEN SPACE IN CALIFORNIA
WE HAVE COYOTES HOWL ALL THE TIME
SO I REALLY ENJOY THEIR THEIR SINGING YOU THEY'RE REALLY BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS
MM
OKAY UM MOVING ON TO
SLIGHTLY MORE SERIOUS STUFF
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT PROJECT FINANCES
UM WE HAVE A COUPLE WE'D LIKE TO SELL IT FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE EURO WITH THE PROFIT AIM OF UM FIFTEEN MILLION EURO UM FROM OUR SALES AND BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH THIS IS FOR TELEVISION IT'S A WE HAVE A MARKET RANGE OF INTERNET
LIKE IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET RANGE WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SPECIFICS
UM IN ORDER TO MAKE A PROFIT OF THIS MAGNITUDE WE NEED TO UM BE ABLE TO PRODUCE EACH ONE AT A MAXIMUM OF TWELVE FIFTY EURO
SO WE'RE SELLING IT FOR TWICE WHAT WE'D LIKE TO PRODUCE IT FOR
OKAY UM JUST TO GENERATE A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROJECT UM I COULD I'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES USING RO REMOTE CONTROLS
UM YOUR FIRST IDEAS ABOUT UM CREATING A NEW R REMOTE CONTROL
WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST UM LIKE YOU WHAT ARE THE FEATURES THAT YOU REALLY LIKE WHAT ARE THE FEATURES THAT YOU DON'T LIKE ETCETERA SO
HMM
MM
MM-HMM
UM I WOULD IMAGINE ALL OF THEM
BUT WE COULD BUT IT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD USE LIKE A LITHIUM BATTERY UM THAT WOULD LAST A LOT LONGER THAN LIKE DOUBLE A. S
UM LIKE THO THOSE ARE THE BATTERIES THAT ARE USED IN A LOT OF UM M. P. THREE PLAYERS NOW AND THAT KIND OF THING
UM
UM
OKAY IT SEEMS WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT OVER UM TO UH COMBINING ALL THE REMOTES CONT TOGETHER VERSUS HAVING F FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTES
SO UM LIKE YOU SAID YOU DON'T LIKE HAVING ALL THE BUTTONS ON ONE ON ONE REMOTE AND YET YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE FIVE REMOTES
SO HOW DO WE WORK WITH THAT
MM-HMM
MM
MM
OKAY SO MAYBE HAVE LIKE ONE REMOTE THAT HAS THE MAIN FUNCTIONS ON OFF
CHANNEL CHANGING VOLUME AND ANOTHER ROTE REMOTE WITH ALL THE SPECIAL THINGS
BECAUSE THAT IS ONE THING THAT UM REMOTES TEND TO HAVE BUTTONS THAT THE T. V. S NO LONGER HAVE AS WELL
SO LIKE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM SOMEWHERE 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA M NEED THOSE SPECIAL FUNCTIONS OCCASIONALLY
UM BUT NOT NECESSARILY ON THE M THE NORMAL REMOTE
GOOD QUESTION
I DON'T KNOW THAT YET
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION
UM
I'LL LOOK INTO THAT
IF I CAN
MM
MM
OKAY
'KAY SOUNDS LIKE WE'VE HAD A GOOD LITTLE DISCUSSION FOR OUR FIRST IDEAS
MIND IF WE MOVE ON
PS MM OKAY
UM NOW OUR NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES
I BELIEVE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ONLY WORKING ON THIS THIS ONE FOR ABOUT TWENTY SO WE CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSING MORE NEW IDEAS IF YOU'D LIKE UM
BUT THIS IS JUST A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT WE'LL BE DOING INDIVIDUALLY
UM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN ALIMA WILL BE DOING UM THE WORKING DESIGN
UM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER THAT'S FOR
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS I GUESS LIKE KEEPING IN MIND THE BUTTONS THING THE SIZE OF THE BUTTONS
UM USER REQUIREMENTS UM SO YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT DIFFERENT TRENDS UH ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED
UM I GUESS KIND OF THE SAME UH DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WE'LL GET FROM THE ACTUAL CONSUM S CONSUMERS
MM 'KAY UM
AND YOU WILL GET SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS SENT BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
I REALISED IN THIS PAST ONE WE WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH WE JUST WANTED TO GET A LITTLE BRAIN STORMING DONE
UM SO VERY EXITED TO SEE ALL YOUR ANIMALS AND HOW WHAT WONDERFUL UM ARTISTS WE ALL ARE UM
ANY QUESTIONS
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN AGENDA YET UM I'LL PUT THAT TOGETHER
I'M SURE AS WE'LL EACH GET OUR OWN INSTRUCTION AND THEN UM BECAUSE WHAT WE GONNA DO IS FIRST OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TOGETHER
SO I'M SURE WE'LL ALL HAVE MORE CONCRETE THINGS TO CONTRIBUTE NEXT TIME
MM 'KAY UM I'LL TYPE UP MI MINUTES AND PROBABLY EMAIL THOSE OUT TO ALL OF YOU
UM JUST INCLUDING ALL THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
UM
YES I YES I THINK I CAN
MM-HMM
I'LL JUST ATTACH IT TO AN EMAIL
AND YOU'RE YOU'RE NUMBER TWO THREE FOUR
IS THAT CORRECT
OKAY
EXCELLENT
IT WAS LOVELY MEETING YOU ALL
JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP CHECKING THE COMPANY WEB SITE AND THE EMAILS
LET ME SEE IF I CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW
ALIMA
OKAY
UM I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF THESE I HAVE TO BRING WITH ME
RIGHT SO I'M SUPPOSED TO DRAW MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
I HAVE NO DRAWING SKILLS WHATSOEVER
BUT UH LET'S SEE INTRODUCE MYSELF
MY NAME IS ALIMA BUCCIANTINI
UM I'M FROM THE STATE OF MAINE IN THE US
I'M DOING NATIONALISM STUDIES
BLAH BLAH BLAH AND I HAVE NO ARTISTIC TALENTS
A. L. I. M. A.
OH AND I GUESS I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER ON THIS PROJECT
SO LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET UM HERE
I WILL DRAW A LITTLE TURTLE FOR YOU ALL
NOT NECESSARILY 'CAUSE IT'S MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT JUST THAT I THINK THEY'RE DRAWABLE
AND YOU HAVE THE PRETTY LITTLE SHELL GOING ON
SOME LITTLE EYES
HAPPY
THERE YOU GO
THAT'S A TURTLE
UM
I I LIKE THE WHOLE HAVING A SHELL THING
IT'S QUITE COOL CARRY YOUR HOME AROUND WHERE YOU GO UM QUITE DECORATIVE LITTLE ANIMALS THEY CAN SWIM
THEY CAN THEY'RE VERY ADAPTABLE THEY CARRY EVERYTHING THEY NEED WITH THEM UM AND THEY'RE EASY TO DRAW
NO YOU CAN ERASE THE TURTLE IT'S ALRIGHT
SNAKE
WELL SNAKE
IT'S W
OH A CAT
YEAH
RIGHT
THAT'S
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE
YEAH UM
I AGREE WITH HAVING TOO MANY REMOTES AROUND
MY DAD HAS A WHOLE DRAWER AT HOME OF REMOTES FOR VARIOUS THINGS AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK HALF OF THEM UM
WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME I GUESS IS THAT IT'S EASY TO USE AND THAT THERE'S NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS
THEY ARE NOT TOO SMALL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO N TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
AND ONE THING I PARTICULARLY LIKE IS IF YOU ARE NOT UM SORT OF MOVING IT AROUND TO GET IT TO WORK WITH THE INFRA RED
UM I THINK THERE IS A WAY AROUND THAT
BUT I KNOW IN MY RESIDENCE RIGHT NOW THE THE TELEVISION YOU SORT OF HAVE TO WALK ALL AROUND THE ROOM TO GET IT TO TURN ON
SO I IT'S JUST SIMPLER JUST TO JUST TURN AROUND THE T. V. ITSELF
AND I THINK THAT'S IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL IT SHOULD ACTUALLY WORK FOR WHAT IT'S DOING
SO
I KNOW
YEAH SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T
MM
YEAH
COULD WE GET SOMETHING THAT
JUST HAS
NO DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE BUTTONS THAT YOU NEED TO PROGRAM THE VIDEO RECORDER OR PROGRAM S OTHER THINGS THAT I'M NOT VERY COHERENT ABOUT
BUT THAT JUST HAS YOUR MAJOR BUTTONS FOR THAT WORK FOR EVERYTHING YOU KNOW VOLUME CONTROL ON OFF
CHANNEL CHANGING
YEAH
N THAT WAY
YEAH
YEAH AND IF UM IF YOU'D SAVE THE MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS MAYBE FOR SEPARATE REMOTES THAT YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO USE EVERY DAY
UM
YEAH
MM
RIGHT
MM
MM YEAH
YES
I GUESS WE HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR
IF IT'S JUST A TELEVISION THEN THAT IT'S A BIT SIMPLER 'CAUSE THERE'S LESS BUTTONS THAT WOULD EVEN NEED TO BE ON IT
LARGE
IF YOU HAVE OLDER PEOPLE OR PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT AREN'T VERY CO ORDINATED HAND EYE
IT'S REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT THAT YOU ARE NOT PRESSING A SMALL LIKE TEENY MOBILES PHONE SIZE BUTTONS IF WE CAN HELP IT
HMM
YEAH
'KAY
I'M SURE WE'LL BE BUSY
I'M TWO
ALRIGHT
'KAY
UH OKAY
WELL MY NAME IS IAIN UH
AND I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER FOR THE PROJECT
UM
AND
I'LL TRY AND DRAW MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
I'LL I SHOULD LEAVE THAT ONE ON THERE SHOULDN'T I BEFORE I CALLOUSLY RUB IT OFF
UM I'M NOT GONNA DRAW IT QUITE TO SCALE UM
IS THAT AT LEAST IDENTIFIABLE
IT'S A WHALE YES
THANKS
UM AND YEAH THE REASON I LIKE WHALES IS 'CAUSE UH THEY'RE WELL FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE QUITE INTELLIGENT UM AND ALSO THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF MYSTERIOUS
LIKE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM OR OR UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK HOW THEY FORM GROUPS
AND I JUST FIND THEM INTERESTING ANIMALS
COOL
I'VE USED I'VE USED REMOTE CONTROLS FOR THINGS LIKE T. V. AND THE C. D. PLAYER AND VIDEO RECORDER AND
I I GUESS THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY NEAT NEAT LITTLE TOOLS UH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET UP AND WALK ACROSS THE ROOM TO CHANGE A CHANNEL
SO ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SOMEONE REALLY LAZY LIKE ME THEY THEY'RE PRETTY NICE
UM
I FIND THEM THEY CAN BE A BIT ANNOYING ESPECIALLY
LIKE YOU KNOW IF I'M WATCHING T. V. I HAVE HAVE TO HAVE THREE SEPARATE REMOTE CONTROLS OF IN FRONT OF ME
YOU KNOW ONE FOR THE T. V. ONE FOR THE DIGITAL BOX ONE FOR M THE VIDEO RECORDER AS WELL
UM
AND ALSO THEY TEND TO THEY TEND TO BE A BIT CONFUSING
THEY'VE GOT TOO MANY BUTTONS ON THEM UH TOO TOO SORT OF TOO SORT OF COMPLICATED WHEN ALL I REALLY WANNA DO IS SWITCH ON AND OFF
CHANGE THE CHANNEL CHANGE THE VOLUME
YEAH
MM
YEAH
CAN I ASK ARE WE DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL FOR A TELEVISION ONLY UM AND IF IF THIS DEVICE IS JUST TO BE USED FOR THE TELEVISION
WOULD WE EVEN TECHNICALLY BE POSSIBLE TO INCLUDE VIDEO RECORDER FUNCTIONS ON IT
UM OR SHOULD WE JUST STICK TO JUST STICK TO HAVING TELEVISION TELEVISION RELATED BUTTONS ON IT
SO WE SHOULD MAYBE WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT I T IT'S JUST A TELEVISION THAT WE'RE WANTING TO CONTROL
WELL
I MEAN I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE PLAYING AND RECORD AND STOP BUTTONS ON IT FOR THE VIDEO RECORDER AS WELL I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WORKS TECHNOLOGICALLY OR NOT
YEAH
YEAH
'KAY
WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DISCUSSING AT THE NEXT MEETING
DO WE KNOW THAT
RIGHT
YEP
YEP
OKAY
CAN YOU E MAIL YOUR SLIDES AS WELL
IS THAT POSSIBLE
COOL
'KAY
HMM
YES
WELL
OH MY GOD IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO
TAKE MY CONTRAPTIONS WITH ME
ALRIGHT I'M JESSY
I'M FROM AROUND D. C. ISH SORT OF IN THE U. S.
AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE DEEP SEA SORT OF THEME GOING ON ANIMAL
DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DRAW THIS
JUST WHERE CAN I
MM
MM
MAYBE IF I DO THE WATER BUT HOW
SORT OF GIVE AN IDEA
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW ONE WOULD EXPLAIN THIS
MM MAYBE WITH SOME WHISKERS
BRIEFLY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SEAL
YOU CAN IMAGINE IT IN THE WATER
I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE PLAYFUL AND SILLY SORT OF HAVE A GOOD TIME
NOT GONNA TRY AND PRETEND LIKE I CAN GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT
IT'S DEFINITELY SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER ONCE YOU ARE DOING IT
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE
UM I HATE WHEN THERE'S LIKE FOUR DIFFERENT BUTTONS AND YOU HAVE TO PRESS TO ACTUALLY TURN ON THE T. V. LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO ONE FOR THE POWER OF THE T. V. AND THEN LIKE ANOTHER ONE TO GET THE ACTUAL SCREEN ON AND SOMETHING ELSE TO GET IT ALL GOING
I DON'T KNOW
NOW THEY KEEP COMBINING ALL DIFFERENT REMOTES TOGETHER AND I DON'T KNOW IF I NECESSARILY LIKE THAT 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU END UP WITH MULTIMEDIA OVERLOAD
I JUST WANNA WATCH THE T. V. UM
ALWAYS GETS LOST
SOME SORT OF LIKE
DEVICE TO HELP YOU FIND IT
YEAH
WHAT ABOUT LIKE BATTERIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE ARE THERE SOME REMOTES THAT DON DON'T REQUIRE
LIKE BATTERIES OR DO ALL REMOTES REQUIRE BATTERIES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND MAYBE THAT SPATIALLY DIVIDES IT SO IT'S LIKE IF YOU'RE LOOKI IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THE T. V. ON THAT'S YOU KNOW
LIKE THE TOP THING ON THE REMOTE I DUNNO IF D BE VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
BUT IF IT'S LIKE ALL THE T. V. STUFF WAS HERE THEN ALL THE V. C. R. STUFF WAS HERE
ALL THE WHATEVER ELSE WE HAVE PROGRAMMED INTO IT IT'S ALL JUST IN ITS SEPARATE PLACE AND NOT LIKE ALL THE ON BUTTONS TOGETHER
'CAUSE THEN YOU LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TURNING ON
MM-HMM
MM-HMM HMM
I THINK IT'S JUST T. V. I MEAN IF IT IF WE'RE TAKING IT JUST NEW PRODUCT A NEW TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S NOT LIKE DOESN'T SAY
YOU KNOW THINGS MIGHT BE MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT
IT'S AN IDEA WITH THE BUTTONS BEING REALLY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I'M FOUR
GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN
LET'S SEE IF THAT COMES UP
THIS IS OUR FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING
UM
JUST A SEC WHILE MY POWERPOINT COMES UP
ET VOILA
OKAY
MM UM WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
LET'S START
OKAY OUR AGENDA TODAY UM JUST CHECK THE TIME IT'S TWELVE THIRTEEN
UM
I'M GONNA DO AN OPENING TALK ABOUT UM DID YOU ALL GET THE MINUTES
I E MAILED THEM TO YOU
I'M ALSO PUTTING 'EM THEM IN THE SHARED FOLDER
SO UM THEN I WE'LL TALK ABOUT OUR GENERAL OBJECTIVES AND HAVE YOUR THREE PRESENTATIONS
UM I'LL TALK ABOUT THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS I'VE JUST RECEIVED AND THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
FINALLY WE'LL JUST CLOSE
WE'RE STARTING THIS MEETING AT APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THIRTEEN AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES
SO
FIRST OF ALL THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OBJECTIVES
UH WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED
THE FUNCTIONS DESIGN WHAT EFFECTS THE APPARATUS SHOULD HAVE AND THE WORKING DESIGN HOW THE APPARATUS ACTUALLY WORKS TO FULFIL ITS FUNCTION
OKAY THREE PRESENTATIONS UM YOU CAN GO IN ANY ORDER YOU CHOOSE UM
SURE PLEASE DO
YES I DO
YEAH
FUNCTION F. EIGHT YEAH
THE BLUE ONE F. N.
IS IT PLUGGED IN ALL THE WAY AND YOU SCREWED IT IN AND
MM 'KAY
IT'S TAKING IT A LITTLE BIT
'KAY THERE YOU GO
PRESS THE LITTLE PRESENTATION
IT'S THE UM IT LOOKS LIKE A Y. KIND OF OVER THERE ABOVE DRAW
THERE THAT ONE THERE YOU GO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT WAS THAT WAS GREAT
UM 'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION UM ON EFFECTS
WAS THAT YOU
GREAT
PUSH
USER INTERFACE RIGHT
INTERFACE
MM 'KAY THANK YOU
OKAY
HMM
HMM
MM 'KAY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT WAS VERY USEFUL
IT'S FUNNY TO SEE THE DRASTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO REMOTES
UM
AND NEITHER OF THEM WERE VERY PRETTY YOU KNOW
MM
MM
YOU THERE IT IS
LOVELY
HMM
UM THE IT'S RIGHT ABOVE DRAW
THERE ARE THREE THINGY IF IT'S WAY AT THE BOTTOM
UNDER THREE ICONS AND IT'S THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A DESK
YEAH THAT ONE
THERE ARE Y. S
YOU JUST PRESS YEAH JUST CLICK
THAT'LL BE FINE
UM YEAH USE THAT THING YOU CAN GO BACK PREVIOUS
PARDON
OH WELL
OKAY
YE
DOUBLE CLICK ON IT
WITH THE RIGHT WITH THE LEFT HAND ONE
THERE WE ARE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
EXCELLENT
SO UM
YES ABSOLUTELY
AH I CAN NEVER TELL WHICH WAY TO TURN THESE THINGS
LEFTY LOOSEY RIGHTY TIGHTY RIGHT
LEFTY LOOSEY RIGHTY TIGHTY
OH YES
MM 'KAY
UM I HAVE NOTHING ON MY SCREEN
JUST A SEC
HERE WE ARE
OKAY YEAH IT'S FINE
OKAY REQUIREMENTS
WE HAVE A COUPLE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT I WAS JUST E MAILED RIGHT BEFORE THE MEETING AND THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN IN UM IN MIND AS WE'RE CREATING THIS
WE DIDN'T BRING IT UP YET OR AT ALL IN THE MEETINGS SO FAR
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA WORK WITH TELETEXT BECAUSE UM WELL IT THAT'S BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE INTERNET
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA WORRY ABOUT UM WE'RE NOT GONNA WORRY ABOUT THAT
UM
IT NO
W D COULD WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN IT
HOW
OKAY
INTERESTING
OKAY UM WELL WE'RE NOT GONNA THE MANAGEMENT HAS DECIDED WE'RE NOT GONNA WORK WITH THAT
UM
OKAY UM AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA W LIKE YOUR QUESTION EARLIER UM WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO BE T FOR TELEVISION VIDEO OR ETCETERA
JUST FOR TELEVISION
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON
UM OTHERWISE BECOMES TO COMPLEX WE WANNA GET THIS OUT UM VERY QUICKLY
WE ONLY HAVE A A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
UM AND FINALLY THERE'S MORE MARKETING I THINK UM OUR CORPORATE IMAGE HAS TO BE RECOGNISABLE
SO WHILE WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY WE NEED TO USE OUR COLOUR AND OUR SLOGAN I IN THE NEW DESIGN
LOOKS LIKE YEAH KIND OF A YELLOW AND BLACK AND WE HAVE THAT THE EMPHASIS ON THE R. S IN UM MM-HMM
BUT IT'S YEAH WE PUT THE UM
FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
SO WE GOTTA KEEP THAT IN THAT IN MIND
YEP
YEP
YEAH OR HA MAYBE SOME BUTTONS COULD BE YELLOW
LIKE WE CAN WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE BIT
UM
OKAY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT OUR FUNCTIONS AND OUR TARGET GROUP
WE NEED TO DECIDE WHO OUR TARGET GROUP IS
YOU UM IN YOUR ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT MARKET UM OF THE MARKETING YOU IDENTIFIED THAT DIFFERENT GROUPS WANTED DIFFERENT THINGS OR HAD CERTAIN PREFERENCES
FOR EXAMPLE THAT UM THAT OLDER PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR UM VOICE RECOGNITION BUT YOUNGER PEOPLE DID
UM AND SO WHO ARE WE AIMING THIS AT
MM-HMM
IT'S GONNA BE TWENTY FIVE EURO REMEMBER SO UM IT HAS TO BE AVAI MARKETABLE TO UM WHOMEVER IT IS
WELL AT LEAST RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS UM DECIDING ON JUST THE REMOTE ITSELF SO IT WILL PROBABLY BE SOLD SEPARATELY TWENTY FIVE EURO BY ITSELF
NOW THOSE ARE THAT'S ALL SPECIFIC FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
ARE WE GONNA USE THAT AS ONE OF OUR FUNCTIONS
MM-HMM
MM
TO PRODUCE IT YES
MM
THAT'S A GOOD THING TO KEEP IN MIND
UPGRADE
WELL WE CAN LOOK FOR WE CAN LOOK AT UPGRADE OR WE CAN LOOK AT UM USER FRIENDLY
SIMPLIFICATION SO
UH-HUH MM
AND WE ALSO NEED TO TALK ABOUT IF WE'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE THE VERY SIMPLE ONES OR ALSO HAVE THE OTHER ONES JUST SEPARATE SOMEHOW OR
KIND OF PULL OUT OF THE SIDE
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T IMPEDE UM THE CHIP TRANSMITTING INFORMATION BUT UM THAT'S GONNA BE MOSTLY TECHNOLOGICAL THING
UM
OKAY UM SO WHAT ARE WE EMPHASISING
I WHAT IN THIS PROJECT
SIMPLICITY AND FASHION
OKAY THOSE ARE VERY GOOD GOALS I THINK UM THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IN WITH EVERYTHING WE DO
SIMPLICITY AND FASHION AND YEAH OR USABILITY SPECI HOWEVER YOU WANNA SAY THAT
WHICH INCLUDES UM AN EMPHASIS ON MAKING THE INFRA RED VERY FUNCTIONAL SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AROUND A LOT
UM
I THINK IT'S A LOT TO DO WITH BATTERY BUT THAT'S JUST MY
MM-HMM
SO OUR TARGET GROUP WE'RE SAYING FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE
S VOICE RECOGNITION WHICH I KIND OF I KIND OF FEEL LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT NECESSARY IN A REMOTE CONTROL
LIKE IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR A T. V. BUT NOT FOR THE REMOTE C YOU KNOW
SEEMS A LITTLE BIT
MM-HMM
YEAH AND IT MIGHT BE TOO EXPENSIVE
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
UNDER SIXTY FIVE OKAY THAT'S A GOOD START
UM
I'D SAY WE'RE UH CAN WE NARROW IT DOWN TO MAYBE UM
TEENAGERS AND FAMILIES
'CAUSE THAT WOULD GO UP TO LIKE FIFTY
OKAY SINGLE
IT'S IT'S HARD TO NARROW IT DOWN
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO MAYBE IT'S MORE USEFUL TO D D TO DEFINE OBJECTIVES LIKE FASHION AND SIMPLICITY THAN TO FIND SPECIFIC TARGET GROUP AS FAR AS AGE IS BECAUSE
YEAH THINGS SO DIFFERENT WILL APPEAL TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT
OKAY
UM OH THERE'RE A COUPLE FUNCTIONS DO WE WANT SOMETHING SO THAT DO WE WANT SOME KIND OF THING TO FIND IT IF IT'S LOST
LIKE A BUTTON ON A T. V. YOU CAN PRESS AND IT'LL RING OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW LIKE OR BEEP
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR MINUTES LEFT TO DEFINE OUR FUNCTIONS
SO LET'S DO THAT QUICKLY
UM SO WE WANT SOMETHING TO KEEP IT FROM GETTING LOST
AND WE WANT
UM
WE WANT LARGE BUTTONS FOR THE ESSENTIAL THINGS
LARGE ACCESSIBLE BUTTONS FOR THE ESSENTIALS
WE WANT A POSSIBILITY TO UM TO GET UM
A POSSIBILITY TO GET THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS
MM-HMM
UM YEAH HIDDEN WAY
AND WE ALSO WANT IT TO BE FASHIONABLE WHICH I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S A FUNCTION SO MUCH AS A UM YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY DO IT
ANY OTHER ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS THAT WE NEED
BATTERY
DO WE NEED A LONG LIFE BATTERY
BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL
YEAH I WOULD IMAGINE
JUST 'CAUSE IT IS AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE THE
CHARGING
MM-HMM
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT UM SPACE IN LIVING ROOMS TOO LIKE 'CAUSE THEY'RE I MEAN WOULD YOU PUT IT ON TOP OF THE T. V.
I DON'T KNOW JUST THINK OKAY THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD IDEA WE'LL KEEP IT
THINK IT'S
AND MAYBE FUN
OKAY
UM 'KAY WE'RE GONNA CONCLUDE NOW HAS EVERYONE SAID THEIR FUNCTIONS AND 'KAY
UM AFTER THE MEETING WE'RE GONNA EACH COMPLETE A SKS UM A QUESTIONNAIRE AND A SUMMARIES SUMMARY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SUMMARISATION
UM AND THEN WE'LL HAVE OUR LUNCH BREAK
AFTER THAT WE HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF INDIVIDUAL WORK
UM I'LL MAKE SURE TO PUT UP UM THE MINUTES AND THE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND INCLUDING THESE POWERPOINT SLIDES
IF EVERYONE COULD DO THAT AS WELL THAT'D BE GREAT
UM YOU EACH HAVE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS I. UM I. D. INDUSTRIAL DESIGN YOU'VE YOUR COMPONENTS CONCEPT USER INTERFACE THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT MARKET TREND WA WATCHING
AND AS AS PER LAST TIME YOU'LL GET SPECIFIC INCRAT INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH E MAILED TO YOU
AND HOPEFULLY I HOPE NEXT TIME YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS MORE OF THE WEB SITE THAT THEY THEY SEEM TO TELL YOU THAT YOU COULD
IT'S KINDA FRUSTRATING BUT UM
BE SURE TO NOTE ANY FRUSTRATIONS OR ANY UM ISSUES THAT COME UP IN YOUR UM IN YOUR UM SUMMARY
MM 'KAY
GREAT SEEING Y'ALL
LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE UM LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A SECOND ONE KIND OF OF MINE THAT'S THAT I DIDN'T DO
IT'S FROM LIKE AN EARLIER PROJECT I THINK SO UM
UNDER THE SHARED FOLDER I DON'T KNOW IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE UNDER YOURS AS WELL
PROJECTS
OKAY
YOU DON'T HAVE MINE
S
MM
OKAY
WELL I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT IN THE MEANTIME
OKAY
RIGHT
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DISCONNECT ROSE
YEAH
I I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO PUSH IT IN REALLY HARD
OH GOT IT
MM NEITHER HAVE I
ALRIGHT
HMM
'KAY
HMM
HMM
MM 'KAY
OKAY GREAT
HMM
YEAH
I THINK THAT COULD BE OUR SELLING POINT
RIGHT
HMM
RIGHT I REALLY CAN'T SEE WHAT I'M DOING SO DOES ANYONE HAVE A
AH HA LOOK AT THAT SHOWING UP ALREADY
YEAH
ALRIGHT UM
NO HOW DO I PLAY AGAIN
AH
OKAY
SO THIS IS OUR WORKING DESIGN PRESENTATION
UM I HAD A BIT OF SOME ISSUES WITH THIS BECAUSE I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND EVERYTHING I NEEDED BUT I GUESS THAT'S WE'RE STILL IN EARLY STAGES
UM SO YEAH THIS IS THIS
THOUGH TH THE THING ABOUT WORKING DESIGN IS THE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS A WORKING DESIGN IS FIGURE OUT HOW THE APARATA APPARATUS CAN FULFIL ITS FUNCTION
UM ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT KEPT COMING UP FOR ME IS THAT A COFFEE GRINDER
IT WORKS BECAUSE IT CONVERTS ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO GRINDING THE BEANS AND THEN YOU PUT THE BEAN THROUGH A FILTER AND THAT FILTERS OUT
AND THEN YOU GET COFFEE AT THE END THAT'S NICE AND HOT BECAUSE OF THE COMBINATION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY AND THEN THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BROUGHT IN TO MAKE IT WORK
DON'T KNOW IF I'M EXPLAINING THAT VERY WELL BUT HOW DO I GET TO THE NEXT S AH
SO H THE METHOD AS UM WORKING DESIGNERS FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE IT FULFIL THIS PRACTICAL FUNCTION
WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND HOW DO WE CONVERT ALL THE ELEMENTS TO MAKE THAT DONE
SO WHA THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE POINTS
AT WHICH YOU NEED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN
SO YOU MAKE A SCHEMATIC OF THE WAY THAT THE THE ENERGY IS CONVERTED
TSH TOWARDS THIS PRACTICAL FUNCTION
AND THEN I THINK THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS GONNA BE WORK ON EACH TASK SEPARATELY
SO UM
UH
UH
SO THE FINDINGS THAT I GOT UH VERY JUST VERY BRIEFLY IS THAT YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF THE WAY THAT THE INFORMATION IS PROJECTED TO THE RECEIVER AND IN MY OPINION INFRA RED IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT 'CAUSE YOU DON'T NEED A SIGHT LINE
SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'RE GONNA WORK ON
UM THE USER INTERFACE IS CRITICAL HERE
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN A REMOTE CONTROL HAPPEN THROUGH THE CHIP THAT CONTROLS THAT CONVERTS THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY INTO DATA
WHICH THEN GOES THROUGH THE INFRA RED SO THE THE CHIP THAT UH I THINK IAN IS DESIGNING IS GONNA BE CRUCIAL
AND REALLY IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THE TO THE USER BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONE THAT'S CONTROLLING MOST OF THE WORKING DESIGN
SO THE COMPONENTS THAT WE FIND HERE ARE THE ENERGY SOURCE YOU KNOW THE BATTERY OR WHATEVER THAT'S GONNA M MAKE IT WORK THEN THE CHIP
WHICH CONVERTS THE DATA THE USER THAT'S CONTROLLING THE CHIP AND THE INFRA RED BULB THAT'S GONNA LET US MOVE THE DATA TO THE RECEIVER
SO YOU HAVE FOUR MAIN COMPONENTS AND THEY ARE DESIGNED SORT OF LIKE THIS
YOU HAVE YOUR ENERGY SOURCE RIGHT THERE WHICH THEN UM BRINGS
UH ENERGY OR INFORMATION TO THE CHIP WHICH IS ALSO CONTROLLED BY THE USERS
YOU HAVE ENERGY GOING TO THE USER WHO'S CONTROLLING THE CHIP OOH 'S NOT WHAT I WANTED TO DO UH UH
PREVIOUS
SORRY ABOUT THAT GUYS
OH
NO NO NO NO NO
OKAY LET'S JUST GET BACK TO MY SCHEMATIC HERE
W YEAH YEAH
I THINK IT'S FROZEN
HERE
DON'T SHOW ME THAT TIP AGAIN
THERE WE ARE
SORRY ABOUT THIS GUYS
I'M KIND OF PATHETIC WITH THINGS LIKE THIS
UM ALRIGHT
SO YOU HAVE YOUR ENERGY SOURCE YOUR USER INTERFACE WHO'S CONTROLLING THE CHIP THE CHIP ALSO USES THE ENERGY
AND THE CHIP THROUGH THE USE OF THE USER INTERFACE IS GONNA CONTROL THE SWITCH WHICH WILL WORK YOUR INFRA RED BULB
WHICH WILL THEN BRING THE DATA TO THE RECEIVER
SO HOPEFULLY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR EVERYONE IN MY KIND OF GARBLED WAY
THIS IS THE THE PARTS OF THE WORKING DESIGN THAT NEED TO BE FIGURED OUT
AND PERSONAL PREFERENCES BESIDES THE FACT THAT I CAN'T SPELL WE NEED A LONG LASTING ENERGY SOURCE PEOPLE DON'T WANNA BE CHANGING IT A LOT
WE NEED A CHIP THAT WORKS WELL WITH THE USER INTERFACE THAT ISN'T TOO COMPLICATED
WE NEED A STRAIGHTFORWARD INTERFACE LIKE IAN WAS SAYING SIMPLE NOT OVERWHELMING IT WITH INFORMATION AND WE NEED A RELIABLE AND CLEAR INFRA RED SIGNAL
SO THAT YOU'RE NOT WAVING YOUR REMOTE AROUND AND HAVING TO GET FRUSTRATED AND GO DO IT BY HANDS
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR THE WORKING DESIGN
ROSE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S GONNA STICK IN YOUR HEAD
MM
OOH NO SIGNAL
OKAY
UH IT'S A BRITISH THING
NO
S
LOTTERY NUMBERS AND SPORT SCORES
BUT IF YOU EVER SEE THE T. V. SAYING LIKE GO TO PAGE ONE SIXTY ON CEEFAX NOW THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY WE DON'T HAVE IT BUT
'KAY
MM
OKAY SO WE WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD
AND IS YELLOW
OKAY
WELL IF WE'RE GONNA SAY THAT FUNCTION UM FASHION WE PUT THE FASHION IN IN ELECTRONICS THEN YOU AUTOMATICALLY
I THINK A SORT OF YOUNGER GROUP THAT THAT'S WHO'S GONNA BE ATTRACTED TO THIS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY UH A POPULATION W QUITE A LITTLE BIT OF DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR USE ON TECHNOLOGY ANYWAY
SO THAT MIGHT BE A FAIRLY GOOD TARGET GROUP FOR US
MM
TO PRODUCE IT YEAH
HMM
BUT RIGHT
WELL BUT WHY ARE WE WHY ARE WE AIMING FOR A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT
EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS EASE OF USE AND SIMPLE AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN MORE TECHNOLOGY IN FACT IT COULD USE IT COULD MEAN NOT
IF THEY MIGHT BE OVERWHELMED WITH WITH REMOTES THAT HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS AND TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY
YEAH SIMPLIFICATION
THEY COULD HAVE A CRAP REMOTE THAT CAME WITH THEIR T. V. THAT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO USE OR MAYBE IT BROKE OR MAYBE THEY'RE JUST MISSING IT
HMM
OOH
OOH
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM
GOOD POINT
YEAH
YEAH MM
THE BATTERY AND THAT I THINK THAT THE CHIP TAKES THE DATA AND PRESENTS IT WELL WITHOUT SORT OF SCATTERING
YEAH
I THINK SO
THE QUALITY UH QUALITY OF ALL THE COMPONENTS REALLY I MEAN WE CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING SHODDY WORK 'CAUSE IT'S
GONNA BE VISIBLE DOWN THE LINE
MM MM
YEAH
OOH
YEAH
I
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT I TH I THINK REGARDLESS WE'RE WE'RE AIMING FOR THE UNDER SIXTY FIVE OR SOMETHING
OR LIKE SINGLE PROFESSIONALS OR SOMETHING
YEAH
IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT RIGHT NOW
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD POINT
YEAH
MM
YEAH T PROBABLY
MM
MM
YEAH THAT'LL PROBABLY BE GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
ALRIGHT
BATTERY BATTERY USE
YEAH BUT I THINK THAT GOES IN WITH SIMPLICITY AND EASE OF USE REALLY
YEAH
YEAH
MM
IT I THINK IT DOES
I DON'T I DON'T THINK OF A WAY YOU CAN OPERATE A CHIP AND CONVERT THAT MUCH DATA WITHOUT WITHOUT ONE
BUT YOU COULD MAYBE HAVE IT IN A LITTLE CHARGING STATION LIKE A MOBILE PHONE OR LIKE A LITTLE CRADLE FOR YOUR IPOD
YOU COULD WE COULD MAYBE DO THAT INSTEAD
SO YOU DON'T HA YOU GOT LIKE A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY
I DUNNO THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO LESS PEOPLE LOSING IT TOO IF IT IT STAYS IN ONE PLACE
MM
YEAH
THAT'S JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
YEAH WHO KNOWS
OKAY
SOUNDS GOOD
YES I JUST DID THAT
HOPEFULLY IT IS THERE FOR PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
TECHNICAL
SO IN THERE WE HAVE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS PRESENTATION WORKING DESIGN PRESENTATION AND THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I HAVE IN
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I HAVE AS WELL R ROSE SO
YEAH
OKAY
YEP
WELL THERE'S A WEE A WEE PLUG JUST JUST THAT ONE THERE
AH THAT'S IT YEP
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PRESS FUNCTION F. EIGHT I THINK IT IS ON YOUR LAPTOP
THAT'S IT
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
SO IF YOU
CHEERS
HERE WE GO
RIGHT SO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE TECHNICAL TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL UM
WE NEED TO START BY CONSIDERING WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL ACTUALLY IS
IT'S A DEVICE THAT ALLOWS US TO PRODUCE CERTAIN EFFECTS ON OUR TELEVISION SO I IT'S BASICALLY A COMMUNICATION DEVICE
WE WE TELL THE REMOTE CONTROL WHAT WE WANT TO DO IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE TELEVISION SAYING CHANGE THE CHANNEL
CHANGE THE VOLUME UH YEAH ADJUST THESE SETTINGS ADJUST THE BRIGHTNESS
UM HOW DO WE ACTUALLY GO ABOUT DESIGNING A NEW TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
FIRST THING TO DO IS TO COME UP WITH THE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT OUR FINAL PRODUCT IS GONNA BE LIKE SO WE NEED A A CLEAR IDEA OF EXACTLY WHAT THIS PRODUCT DOES
UH HOW IT WORKS AND WHAT THE END USER IS GONNA WANT FROM THIS PRODUCT
UM
OH A WAY I'D SUGGEST THAT WE COULD GO ABOUT THIS IS BY DESIGNING UH SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROTOTYPES OF USER INTERFACES FOR THIS PRODUCT
UM AND THEN UH TRYING TO GET SOME FEEDBACK UH ABOUT
H HOW WELL THESE PARTICULAR PROTOTYPES WORK UH SORTA FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF 'EM
UM USING A REMOTE CONTROL IS IS QUITE A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE
UM
AND DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PEOPLE SORT OF PREFER DIFFERENT THINGS
UM WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE A A FAIRLY STANDARD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT
WHEN A USERS USING A REMOTE CONTROL HE OR SHE EXPECTS THE BUTTONS TO BE IN CERTAIN PLACES
SO IN SOME SENSE WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO AIM FOR A DEVICE WHICH IS FAIRLY CONVENTIONAL IN DESIGN UH SO THAT WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY SHOCKING PEOPLE
BUT I THINK WITHIN THAT THERE IS ALSO ROOM FOR US TO INTRODUCE NOVEL IDEAS UH AND TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
SOMETHING THAT STANDS OUT
UM ALSO IN IN DESIGNING THE USER INTERFACE WE NEED TO CONSIDER PRACTICALITIES
UH THE FIRST OF THESE IS IS TECHNOLOGICAL YE UH WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF TECHNOLOGY AS IT IS
THE SECOND IS IS ECONOMIC UH WE NEED TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN FEATURES AND PRICE
SO AS YOU MENTIONED THINGS LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD WOULD ADD TO THE PRICE UH BUT IT WOULD ALSO IM IMPROVE THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT
SO I HAD A LOOK ON THE ON THE WEB UH TO SEE IF I COULD FIND A FEW EXAMPLES OF EXISTING TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROLS
IN ANALYSING THESE WE CAN CONSIDER WHAT WHAT THINGS WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THEM
UH WHAT THINGS DO THEY GET RIGHT WHAT'S BAD ABOUT THEM WHAT'S WRONG WITH 'EM
UM HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ON THE DESIGNS THAT THAT THAT I FOUND AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE OUR PRODUCT STAND OUT FROM FROM THE LARGE MAJORITY OF REMOTE CONTROLS
HERE'S TWO EXAMPLES UH PROBABLY AT THE EXTREME ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM
UM ON THE LEFT HERE WE'VE GOT UH AN ENGINEERING BASED DESIGN FOR A REMOTE CONTROL SO IT'S ONE THAT'S GOT LOTS OF BUTTONS
IT'S IT'S FULLY FEATURED EVERYTHING YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY WANT TO DO IS THERE YOU KNOW IT'S GOT FORWARD
BACKWARDS UP DOWN CHANNEL NUMBERS VOLUME UH FREEZE FRAME
YEAH IT'S IT'S FULLY FEATURED AND IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE TO GET TO LEARN TO USE IT
BUT ONCE YOU'VE LEARNED IT YOU CAN YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH YOUR T. V.
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS A LOT MORE BASIC
IT'S JUST GOT THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE T. V. CHANGING THE CHANNEL PLAY STOP VOLUME
IT WOULD BE A LOT QUICKER TO LEARN TO USE IT BUT AGAIN TH IT'S IT'S SWINGS AND ROUNDABOUTS
THERE ARE DISADVANTAGES YOU CAN'T USE IT SAY TO TO FREEZE THE TELEVISION PICTURE
UH THERE'S A LOT OF FEATURES THAT ARE MISSING FROM THAT REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE'VE GOT TO TO FIND OUR FIND A WAY OF STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO
UM AS I SAID BEFORE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE SUBJECTIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WANT WANT DIFFERENT THINGS
UM PERSONALLY WA WHAT I WANT FROM A REMOTE CONTROL IS A DEVICE THAT'S SIMPLE
IT IT'S EASY TO USE UH IT'S GOT BIG BUTTONS FOR DOING THE THINGS I DO MOST OFTEN CHANGING THE VOLUME CHANGING THE CHANNEL
IT IT DOES EVERYTHING THAT I NEED IT TO UH AS I SAID BEFORE
I'M QUITE LAZY I DON'T WANNA WALK ACROSS THE ROOM JUST TO ADJUST MY TELEVISION
I ALSO WANT SOMETHING THAT THAT LOOKS COOL UM AND THAT THAT FEELS GOOD THAT'S ERGONOMICALLY DESIGNED
I THINK THERE'S THERE'S CERTAINLY A MARKET FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT LOOKS COOL
AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHY COMPANIES LIKE APPLE'VE 'VE 'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS
UH THAT WAS JUST ON THE D ON THE COMPANY WEB SITE YEAH
WHAT'S UP
LEFTY LOOSEY
UH
NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE THAT'S GOOD
I'LL THINK OF THAT EVERY TIME NOW
YOU DON'T HAVE IT IN THE STATES
OH I DIDN'T REALISE
UM YEAH IT'S LIKE A
I SUPPOSE IT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO A VERY VERY BASIC WEB BROWSER
UM YOU HAVE LIKE YOU HAVE UH NUMBERS ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UH Y AND YOU TYPE IN THE PAGE NUMBER YOU WANT
SO LIKE YOU TYPE A HUNDRED ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND THIS THIS KIND OF INDEX APPEARS ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN WITH JUST SOME SOME TEXT AND SOME VERY BLOCKY LOOKING GRAPHICS ON IT
AND YOU JUST TYPE NUMBERS TO GO TO DIFFERENT PAGES AND IT GIVES YOU INFORMATION
MOSTLY RATHER BORING STUFF LIKE WHAT'S ON T. V. NEXT AND SHARE PRICES AND THAT KIND OF THING
YEP NEWS HEADLINES
IT'S EARL IT'S PRETTY OLD TECHNOLOGY
IT'S LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
RIGHT
SO WHAT'S OUR CORPORATE IMAGE LIKE
IT'S IT'S KIND OF YELLOW COLOUR WITH UH WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
IT'S LIKE DOUBLE R.
YEAH
IS IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE SOLD SEPARATELY FROM THE TELEVISION OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT COMES W WITH A TELEVISION
'CAUSE THAT WOULD AFFECT THE WAY THAT WE MARKET IT
RIGHT
RIGHT OKAY
YEAH
UM
I I WOULD SAY NO BECAUSE IT'S GONNA ADD TOO MUCH TO THE PRICE
ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE MARKETING IT AS A SEPARATE PRODUCT PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE PAYING UH
WELL UH WE'VE GOT A PRICE LIMIT OF WAS IT TWELVE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS FOR TO PRODUCE IT
AND I WONDER IF WE CAN GET VOICE RECOGNITION INTO THAT TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE TOO MANY OTHER COMPROMISES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THE REMOTE THERE ARE REMOTE CONTROLS LIKE THAT YEAH
LIKE SOME T. V. S THEY HAVE A SORT OF UH A SLIDING SCREEN ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OF IT THAT HIDES ALL THE COMPLICATED BUTTONS
SO IF YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING COMPLICATED LIKE PROGRAMME YOUR TELEVISION OR RE TUNE IT
THEN YOU YOU OPEN UP THIS LITTLE HATCH OR OR SLIDE THE SCREEN DOWN AND THERE'S ALL THE ALL THE SPECIAL BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH
YEAH
SI SIMPLICITY AND FASHION
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S YEAH IT'S PRETTY IT'S PRETTY HIGH TECH
IT'S FOR LIKE THE ULTIMATELY LAZY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T EVEN BE BOTHERED TO PICK UP THE REMOTE
YEP
I THINK THE PRODUCT APPEALS ACROSS A QUITE A BROAD RANGE OF AGES
I MEAN WE WE SAID SIMPLICITY IS IS ONE OF THE FEATURES SO IT'S GOING TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE MAYBE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH TECHNOLOGY
YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO GET SCARED BY HAVING LOTS OF BUTTONS AND THAT MIGHT BE OLDER PEOPLE
BUT THEN WE'VE ALSO GOT FASHION WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY APPEALS TO YOUNGER PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH AIM FOR A AN INCOME GROUP
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
WHICH ARE KIND OF HIDDEN AWAY IN SOME WAY OR
WELL NOT HIDDEN BUT THEY'RE UH
THEY'RE NOT AS PROMINENT AS THE MAIN FEATURES
WE SHOULD MAYBE INVESTIGATE WHETHER IT NEEDS A BATTERY AT ALL
I SUSPECT THE REMOTE CONTROL DOES NEED A BATTERY BUT
I DUNNO IF YOU CAN
YEAH
YEAH WITHOUT THE ENERGY YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S POSSIBLE
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
MM SHALL WE GO IN THE ORDER THAT YOU JUST DID IT
I DUNNO
HOW DO I HOOK MY SCREEN UP
WHERE DOES IT GO
MM-HMM
HMM I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO MOVE THIS BUT
WHERE'S FUNCTION
NO SIGNAL
AH WAIT 'S SCREW IN
PUSH THE SCREW
MM ALRIGHT
I'VE NEVER ATTACHED TO ANYTHING
ALRIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO UM THE REPORT THAT WAS ONLINE OR IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO IS
BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS
NO
ALRIGHT
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT PEOPLE SPECIFIED WHEN THEY WERE ASKED
UM I GUESS REAL REACTION DID SOME MARKET RESEARCH
THEY HAD A HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THEIR USABILITY LAB AND THEY WATCHED THEM WATCH T. V. AND RECORDED THE FREQUENCY THAT THEY USED PARTICULAR BUTTONS AND THE RELEVANCE THAT THOSE BUTTONS HAD
WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THEY ANALYSED PEOPLE'S DESIRES AND NEEDS
FOCUSING ON THEIR DESIRES UM PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT THEY THOUGHT REMOTES WERE UGLY
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE A HUNDRED SUBJECTS NOTED THAT AND THAT THEY MORE IMPORTANTLY THOUGH
EIGHTY PER CENT SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR A FANCIER LOOKING REMOTE
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING BEYOND WHAT FANCY MEANS BUT THAT'S PARTICULARLY OF USE TO US I THINK
UM ALSO THEY DID SOME QUESTIONS ON VOICE RECOGNITION AND FOUND THAT THE DESIRE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION WAS INVERSELY RELATED TO AGE
SO YOUNGER PEOPLE WERE MORE INCLINED TO WANT SOMETHING WITH VOICE RECOGNITION
WHEREAS THE OLDER PEOPLE IN THE LIKE SIXTY AND ABOVE SEGMENT OR SO DID NOT REALLY THINK THAT THEY WOULD PAY MORE MONEY FOR VOICE RECOGNITIONS
UM PEOPLE ALSO HAD CERTAIN FRUSTRATIONS THAT I THINK THAT WE COULD TRY TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WITH
OUR DESIGN
THAT BEING PEOPLE K UM FRUSTRATED WITH LOSING THEIR REMOTES
I THINK OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE MENTIONED THAT THAT WAS THEIR BIGGEST FRUSTRATION
PEOPLE ARE ALSO FRUSTRATED WITH THE DIFFICULTY IT IS TO LEARN HOW TO USE A REMOTE AND I THINK THAT TIES BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE JUST THAT THERE'S TOO MANY BUTTONS
IT JUST NEEDS TO BE EASY TO USE
IT ALSO MENTIONED SOMETHING CALLED R. S. I. AND I WAS HOPING SOMEONE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INFORM ME AS TO WHAT R. S. I. IS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT
AH
THERE WE GO
WOW
PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THAT
SO I GUESS SORT OF THE CARPAL TUNNEL TYPE THING PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THAT UM THE REPETITIVE USE I GUESS CAUSED A STRAIN
UM LOOKING AT THE NEEDS PEOPLE SPECIFIED THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT PEOPLE'S REMOTES ARE NOT MATCHING THEIR OPERATING BEHAVIOUR
PEOPLE ARE ONLY USING TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTONS THAT THEY HAVE OFFERED TO THEM ON THEIR REMOTE
AND WHAT PEOPLE DO MOST OFTEN IS CHANGING THE CHANNEL AND CHANGING THE VOLUME
PEOPLE ALSO ZAP LIKE TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL ABOUT UM SIXTY FIVE PER CENT DURING AN HOUR OF USE
SO WE REALLY JUST NEED TO FOCUS IN ON THOSE VOLUMES AND CHANNEL CHANGERS RATHER THAN THINGS LIKE THE AUDIO SETTINGS
THE SCREEN SETTINGS AND THE CHANNEL SETTINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE USED MUCH MORE INFREQUENTLY AND PROBABLY JUST COMPLICATE WHAT'S GOING ON
SO I THINK THAT SOME THINGS THAT WE MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF AN L. C. D. SCREEN WAS BROUGHT UP ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY DETAILS ON
WHAT PEOPLE'S PREFERENCES ON THAT WERE SO I DUNNO KNOW IF THAT'S COMING TO ME LATER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT SOMETHING FOR US TO CONSIDER ALSO JUST THE PHENOMENON THAT LESS IS MORE WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE OR WHAT WE WANNA MAKE EASIEST TO USE
MAKE SURE THAT
YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE AN AUDIO SETTING ISN'T GIVEN AS MUCH IMPORTANCE AND VISIBILITY ON THE REMOTE AS SOMETHING LIKE CHANNEL CHANGING THAT'S USED A LOT MORE OFTEN
AND BASICALLY IN ORDER FOR US TO WIN OVER TO THE CONSUMER WE JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
THAT IT HAS A FANCY APPEAL AND THAT IT'S NOT UGLY AND THAT IT FEELS LIKE THE WAY THEY'RE GONNA USE IT
SO IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM ANY HAND INJURIES OR THINGS LIKE THAT
HMM
YEAH HAVE I UNSCREWED IT
HERE WE GO
MM-HMM
AND I THINK THAT'S IN THE SHARED IF I DID IT RIGHT IF ANYONE WANTS TO LOOK AT IT
NO
A FASHION FASHION REMOTE
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO WAIT DID IT LET YOU GO ON THE INTERNET OR WAS THAT JUST WHAT IT LET YOU SEE
OKAY
'CAUSE I WAS LIKE GOOGLING AND THEN I'M LIKE WAIT IT WON'T LET ME GOOGLE
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD ONE IT'LL STICK WITH YOU
WHAT'S TELETEXT
OH
OH SO
MM-HMM
OH
THAT EXPLAINS A LOT
THAT'S GOOD
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES I DO THINK WHO'S GONNA HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY THAT ALSO THAT ONE
THE ONLY BREAK DOWN THAT I WAS GIVEN IN TERMS OF AGE WAS THE VOICE ACTIVATION AND BASICALLY THERE'S A BIG JUMP
AFTER THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE IF IT HAS VOICE SO IT'S LIKE BASICALLY FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE THAT THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
I DUNNO I'M GONNA BE GIVEN ANY OTHER NUMBERS BROKEN DOWN IN TERMS OF AGE LATER
BUT IF THAT'S SORT OF THE ONLY QUALITY THAT WE HAVE THAT IS DIVIDED INTO AGE THEN WE WOULD WANNA STICK BETWEEN THE FIFTEEN AND THIRTY FIVE RANGE
BUT WHAT ELSE ARE WE GONNA PUT I MEAN NOT THAT I'M REALLY GUNG HO ABOUT IT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU CAN PUT IN A REMOTE TO MAKE IT TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THOUGH
SO LIKE OTHER THAN JUST MAKING IT LOOK GOOD
HOW IS IT I MEAN IT CAN LOOK REALLY GREAT AND STILL HAVE THE SAME UP N DOWN BUTTONS AND WHY'S ANYONE GONNA BUY A NEW REMOTE
MM-HMM
IF SOMEONE'S LOOKING TO BUY A NEW REMOTE DON'T THEY WANT LIKE AN UPGRADE
I DUNNO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
CAN YOU LIKE I MEAN THIS MAY BE TOO COMPLICATED BUT I WISH I HAD SOMETHING TO EXPLAIN IT LIKE IF IT WAS JUST A SIMPLE
EITHER THIS WAY OR THIS WAY THAT HAD LIKE THE MAIN BUTTONS AND THEN YOU COULD LIKE PULL SOMETHING OUT
KIND OF AND LIKE YOU GOT THE REST THE BUTTONS BUT THE REST OF THEM LIKE WENT IN
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING
MM-HMM
'CAUSE THEN 'S LIKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANNA EVER LOOK AT THEM
NEVER EVEN HAVE TO SEE THEM AND IF YOU LIKE GET THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL THAT COMES WITH IT AND YOU JUST DON'T EVEN READ IT THEN YOU'LL NEVER EVEN KNOW THAT THOSE THINGS CAN PULL OUT
AND YOU'RE A HAPPY PERSON AND EVERYONE ELSE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE LIKE TWO REMOTES ONE THAT HAS THE EASY ONES AND ONE THAT HAS
MORE COMPLICATED ONES BUT 'S ALL STILL IN ONE
YEAH
I THINK SIMPLICITY FASHION
MM-HMM
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO LIKE MAKE THE INFRA RED MORE FUNCTIONAL LIKE WHY WOULD IT NOT BE
I'M JUST WONDERING
OKAY
SO 'S JUST THE QUALITY OF THE CHIP
OKAY
WELL I DUNNO HOW USEFUL THAT NUMBER IS IF WE'RE NOT DOING
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T
AND IF THE WHOLE IDEA IS YOU'RE USING A REMOTE THEN WHY WOULD YOU HAVE VOICE
LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND THEN IT'S LIKE YOU WOULDN'T NEED A REMOTE YOU'D JUST TALK TO YOUR T. V.
MM YEAH
MAYBE I MEAN IF I GET M MORE NUMBERS I'LL E MAIL YOU BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING IN TERMS OF AGES
BUT THIS DOESN'T DIVIDE UP ANYTHING AND THERE WAS ONLY A HUNDRED SUBJECTS ALSO WHICH ISN'T I MEAN
REALLY ISN'T THAT REPRESENTATIVE
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A HUNDRED SUBJECTS THAT TH THEY THEN CAN SUBDIVIDE INTO AGE GROUPS THAT MEANS THERE'S VERY FEW IN EACH AGE GROUP SO
TWENTY TO LIKE FIFTY FIVE
I DUNNO
WELL MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE TO DEFI DEFINE THE TARGET GROUP BY THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF AGE MAYBE WE CAN DEFINE IT BY LIKE THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF
LIKE H T HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE TO SPEND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE
WELL OBVIOUSLY IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE WHO OWNS A TELEVISION AND LIKE HOW RECENTLY HAVE THEY BOUGHT THEIR TELEVISION LIKE THAT SORT OF THING
YEAH
H
I MEAN LIKE I SAID BEFORE
FIFTY PER CENT OF OF THE FRU F LIKE FRUSTRATION SOMEONE CAN HAVE THAT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE AND HALF THE PEOPLE SAID THAT HAPPENED AND WE ALL MENTIONED IT BEFORE WE KNEW ABOUT IT
AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING SOMETHING EASY THAT SORT OF GOES ALONG WITH IT SO IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE A RANDOM THING TO SORT OF ADD IN
IT WOULD BE RELEVANT TO LIKE THE OVERALL GOAL I THINK SO
HMM
ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE IT'S NOT LIKE AN EYE SORE THAT KIND OF THING
YEAH
SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE THE BATTERY
MM
IT'S GOOD
DID YOU UM WERE YOU ABLE TO LIKE PUT YOURS IN THE GROUP FOLDER
OKAY
YEP
WHERE IS THAT
YOURS IS
I ONLY HAVE THREE I JUST HAVE LIKE OUR THREE
YEAH
NO BUT THAT'S 'CAUSE I THINK YOURS IS IN THE E MAIL SEPARATE LIKE IT'S NOT ON THE SERVER
BUT IF I OPEN IT AND THEN SAVE IT PROBABLY WILL BE THERE
OH WAIT NEVER MIND YOU CAN'T SAVE IT TO THE
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
I G YEAH
TIME IS IT
OKAY
LOVELY TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN
UM IT'S OUR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING AND IT'S STARTING AT APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND SO WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES FOR THIS ONE AGAIN AND SO WE'LL GO JUST AFTER THREE O'CLOCK
UM OKAY OUR AGENDA WE'RE GONNA DO AN OPENING I'M GONNA REVIEW THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING
THEN WE'LL HAVE YOUR THREE PRESENTATIONS UM AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS AND FINALLY WE'LL CLOSE
SO OPENING
UM THESE ARE OUR MINUTES FROM R THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
WE DECIDED OUR TARGET GROUP IS THE FOCUS ON WHO CAN AFFORD IT
BECAUSE WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL APPEAL AND WE SAID IT'S FOR ALL AGE GROUPS DIFFERENT UM FUNCTIONS OF IT
OUR MAIN OBJECTIVES WERE SIMPLICITY AND FASHION
AND S UM IN SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS ARE SOMETHING TO KEEP THE REMOTE FROM GETTING LOST LARGE BUTTONS FOR THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS
A POSSIBILITY FOR EXTRA FUNCTIONS LIKE A SLIDING A SLIDING PIECE AND A LONG LIFE BATTERY OR A CHARGING STATION
OKAY NOW THREE PRESENTATIONS
I'D LIKE TO DO IT IN THIS ORDER FIRST DO THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF COMPONENTS
PROPERTIES AND MATERIALS UM AND THEN THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF USER INTERFACE AND FINALLY TREND WATCHING
MM
'KAY
FUNCTION F. EIGHT IT
THERE WE GO
MM
HMM
MM
YEAH I WONDER
MM-HMM
JUST AN INTERESTING MARKETING KIND OF ELEMENT
UH JUST A REAL QUICK QUESTION UM THE WEIGHT OF THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS HAVE YOU NO IDEA OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM 'KAY
THANK YOU PERFECT
UM IF YOU MADE NOTES YOURSELF YOU CAN PUT THOSE ON OUR UM UNDERNEATH OUR OH UH IN YOUR BOOK THEN DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
'KAY NOW WE'RE UM CONCEPTS CONCEPTS OF USER INTERFACE
YEAH UM
THIS ONE'S SO MUCH TIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE
OKAY
NOPE
THERE WE GO
HERE YOU ARE
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
I DO THINK THAT UM ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FEATURES FOR A REMOTE IS SEEING A MENU AND SEEING WHAT'S ON
UM AND SO LIKE FAVOURITE CHANNELS IS IS APPLICABLE
BUT I THINK TH THAT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF FUNCTION WHERE IT'S UM YOU HAVE T YOU CAN SEE THE TITLE OF THE SHOW OR POSSIBLY A DESCRIPTION OF IT
LIKE I I KNOW I USE THAT OFTEN ENOUGH
WELL IF IT IF IT WAS A L. L. C. D. ON TH ON THE REMOTE I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD F THAT YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEE A
OKAY
OKAY
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE MORE SPECIFICALLY A DIGITAL BOX MM-HMM
MM
OKAY NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO MARKET
MARKETING
EIGHT
OOPS IT'S NOT PLUGGED IN QUITE IN WELL ENOUGH
THERE WE ARE
MM 'KAY
S SWEET
OKAY DO WE HAVE ANY S SOME QUESTIONS FOR THIS LET'S SEE UM
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS HOW TO POSSIBLY USE THESE
UM HOW TO HOW TO USE A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE OR UM OR THE SPONGY MATERIAL AT ALL
LIKE COULD WE MAKE A S LIKE COULD WE MAKE A SPONGY REMOTE
IT WOULD BE EASIER ON THE HANDS
IT'S KIND OF AND THEN IT WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PROTECT LIKE THE CHIP AND ALL THAT I DUNNO
BUT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
F FOR SURE OR MAYBE LIKE
UM COUPLE MAIN ONES BEING LIKE I DUNNO LEMONS OR STRAWBERRIES OR SOMETHING
COULD THEY BE SMELLY
I DON'T KNOW
OR CARROT SHAPED MM
LIKE LARGE BUTTON THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING OF YEAH
MIGHT WOULD YOU THINK YOU YOU DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE ABLE TO HOLD IT
'CAUSE I THINK THE REASON THEY'RE LONG IS YEAH
HARDER TO PUSH
I USUALLY HOLD IT IN ONE HAND
MAYBE
BUT THEN THE BUTTONS WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY SMALL
DON'T YOU THINK
BUT I MEAN IN ORDER TO GET TO ALL OF THEM YOU KNOW
THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SPACE WITH EACH OTHER
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT'S A SCROLL YEAH IT'S A WHEEL
THE ONE I HAVE DOESN'T HAVE THE FOUR ON I LIKE AROUND IT I DON'T THINK
MM
OKAY UM WE HAVE WE'VE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT SO I'M I'M GONNA
CONTINUE WITH MY PRES PRESENTATION
UM I'VE ONE MORE SLIDE BEFORE WE CLOSE BUT IN THAT SLIDE IS WHEN WE NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THIS THESE KINDS OF THINGS
SO I'LL JUST BRING THAT UP AND SHOW YOU ALL
BEFORE WE MOVE ON
UM
YEAH AND THEN LIKE THE THE COVERS COULD BE SPONGY LATEX WHEREA BUT THE ACTUAL MODEL COULD BE TITANIUM
AH HMM-HMM HMM
OKAY UM COMPONENTS CONCEPT
ENERGY CHIP ON PRINT
G
THAT'S TH TH THIS IS THE AGENDA THEY GAVE ME
SO CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS REAL QUICK
MM-HMM
I THINK IT'S AWESOME
I THINK IT'S REALLY COOL
OKAY
IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE REALLY OPTIONS
OKAY
UM OKAY THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE CASE
UM OH BU I GUESS MAYBE IF WE DECIDED ON LIKE A SIMPLE A REGULAR OR AN ADVANCED CHIP MAYBE
IT WOULD BE NICE FOR CHANGING THE VOLUME BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW USEFUL IT'D BE FOR CHANGING THE CHANNEL
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER NUMBERS OR
WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT FOR THE MEETING SO
SO HAVE A SCROLL FOR VOLUME
F
UM
I THINK W WELL I THINK WHEN WE GO ON TO THE UNE USERFACE
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE THE INTERFACE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE UM WHETHER WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SCROLL OR NOT
OKAY LET'S DO CASE
I'M A LITTLE UM I'M A LITTLE HESITANT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT PROTECTING THE STUFF ON THE INSIDE
UM
YEAH I WOULD BE MORE OKAY WITH LIKE A TITANIUM ACTUAL THING AND THEN MAYBE LIKE A MOBILE PHONE KIND OF THING
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
GE O
OKAY
SO WE UH WE DO WANT LATEX
OKAY
LATEX
UM AND PROBABLY IN COLOURS MAYBE FRUITY VEGETABLE COLOURS
FRUITY COLOURS
OKAY UM LET'S GO TO THE UFE USER INTERFACE THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE CHIP I SUPPOSE
WELL WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS RIGHT
YEAH
UM OKAY INTERFACE THE TYPE AND THE SUPPLEMENTS
SO PUSH OR SCROLL RIGHT
OR BOTH
MM-HMM
AND IF WE HAD A SC AN ON SCREEN UM KIND OF THING THAT YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH LIKE YOU CAN USE YOUR BUTTONS TO SCROLL THROUGH THINGS
I THINK THAT YEAH
FOR CHANNEL SURFING I THINK A SCROLL AN ACTUAL LIKE AN IPOD'S KIND OF SCROLL THING WOULD BE TOO FAST I DUNNO
MM-HMM
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU
HOW YOU FEELING
MM-HMM
IT MIGHT BE COOL ENOUGH
OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA GO WITH UM TYPE PUSHBUTTONS AND THEN SUPPLEMENTS HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT
UM I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT ELSE WE'RE GONNA LIKE H HA THE UM THE ADDITIONAL BUTTONS WE CAN USE
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE A MENU BUTTON SO THAT WE CAN ACCESS ON SCREEN THINGS THEN
OKAY UM SO WE'RE DOING AN ON SCREEN MENU THAT WE CAN SCROLL THROUGH
PRE SET CHANNELS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA NEED UM NUMBERS ONE THROUGH ZERO RIGHT
WELL BUT IN ORDER TO PRE SET A CHA OH I GUESS YOU CAN JUST HOLD IT DOWN WHEN YOU GET TO ONE WHEN YOU'RE SCROLLING THROUGH
MM-HMM
OKAY UM FINISHING THE MEETING NOW
UM OUR NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES UM YOU EACH HAVE THINGS TO DO LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN USER INTERFACE DESIGN
PRODUCT EVALUATION AND YOU TWO ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE USING MODELLING CLAY
YOU'LL GET SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR PERSONAL COACH
UM DID WE DECIDE ON A CHIP
LET'S GO WITH A SIMPLE CHIP
OKAY
WE ARE DONE
THANK YOU EVERYONE
OH I DI THESE ARE ALREADY IN OUR SHARED FOLDER SO
MM YEAH
OKAY
THAT WOULD BE ME
ALRIGHT
WELL
ALRIGHT
UM I'M VERY EXCITED BY THIS ONE ACTUALLY GUYS I UH HAD A LOT OF FUN DOING IT
COMPONENTS DESIGN
THIS IS WHERE YOU LOOK AT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL AND WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OUR SPECIFIC REMOTE CONTROL OUT OF
UM
SO WE NEED TO EXAMINE EACH ELEMENT SEPARATELY BUT WE'RE DESIGNING A FULL THING SO YOU WANNA KEEP IT INTEGRATED AS A WHOLE
THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF REMOTE CONTROLS IN GENERAL AND THEREFORE OURS AS WELL
ARE THE CASE THE BUTTONS THE CIRCUIT BOARD WITH THE CHIP AND THE BATTERY
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE HAD SORT OF ADDRESSED BEFORE
BUT I'M GONNA TAKE EACH ONE A LITTLE BIT SEPARATELY HERE AS WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE MADE OF AND WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK LIKE
THE CASE UH THE OPTIONS THAT I'VE GOTTEN FROM HEADQUARTERS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO UM THERE'S THERE'S THE SHAPE OF A CASE
WE COULD DO A FLAT SH A FLAT CASE A CURVED CASE OR MAYBE EVEN A DOUBLE DOUBLE CURVED CASE
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PICTURES OF WHAT THIS EXACTLY LOOKS LIKE YET JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND
BUT THESE ARE THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE FROM MANUFACTURING AND WE CAN MAKE OUR CASE OUT OF PLASTIC
THE M THE MAIN BASE WILL BE PLASTIC BUT WE HAVE ALL THESE SORT OF FASHION AND TECHNOLOGICAL ELEMENTS WE CAN ADD IN
WOOD LATEX TITANIUM RUBBER OR OTHER COLOURED TYPES OF PLASTIC
THAT WOULD BE OUR CASE
UM BUTTONS FOR BUTTONS WE HAVE UM PUSHBUTTONS WHICH IS WHAT REAL REACTION USES THE MOST OFTEN
BUT WE ALSO HAVE SCROR SCROLL WHEELS WHICH CAN HAVE INTEGRATED PUSHBUTTONS OR WE COULD GO ALL HIGH TECH AND HAVE AN L. L. C. D. SCREEN
UM CIRCUIT BOARD AND CHIP WE CAN HAVE A SIMPLE ONE A REGULAR ONE OR AN ADVANCED ONE DEPENDING ON WHAT OUR OTHER NEEDS ARE
AND THEN BATTERY I THINK IS WHERE THINGS GET MOST EXCITING
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LONG LIFE BATTERIES HERE
UM WE CAN WE CAN HAVE YOUR SORT OF BASIC DOUBLE A. BATTERIES BUT WE ALSO HAVE THESE OPTIONS OF UM USING A KINETIC BATTERY
LIKE ARE USED IN HIGH TECH WATCHES WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO MOVE IT A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT TO POWER UP
UM SO SIMPLE MOVEMENTS LIKE PUSHING BUTTONS WOULD RECHARGE THE BATTERY
OR A SOLAR BATTERY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SLIGHT UM COMPLICATIONS WITH SOLAR BATTERIES AS IN WE CAN'T USE A LATEX CASE IF WE HAVE A SOLAR BATTERY
OR UM SOMETHING THEY ONLY DESCRIBED AS THE TYPE OF BATTERY YOU FIND IN TORCHES FROM ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AGO FLASHLIGHTS
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT IS BUT THAT'S THE DESCRIPTION THAT I RECEIVED SO THAT'S WHAT I'M PASSING ON TO YOU
SO THOSE ARE OUR OPTIONS
UM PERSONAL PREFERENCES THAT I WAS THINKING THROUGH HERE'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THROUGH FASHION AND SIMPLICITY
SO IF WE'RE GOING FOR FASHION IN OUR CASES
I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA WANNA LOOK AT IS A CURVED OR A DOUBLE CURVED CASE PROBABLY WITH A VARIETY OF DESIGN ELEMENTS
MAYBE TITANIUM MAYBE SOME WOOD
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT BETTER WHEN I GET SPECIFICS OF THE ACTUAL MATERIALS BUT THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I HAVE IN MIND
AND WE WANNA GO FOR SIMPLICITY
PROBABLY PUSHBUTTONS BUT I'M SORT OF INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA OF A SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL IF ANYONE HAS ANYTHING
ANY IDEAS ON THAT
I MEAN I KNOW THE IPODS AND THINGS RIGHT NOW HAVE TOUCH SCROLL UM BUTTONS WHICH ARE EXACTLY LIKE WHAT THEY'RE DESCRIBING
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE WANNA LOOK INTO
AND I'M REALLY INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA OF A KINETIC BATTERY
SOLAR I DON'T THINK WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE HOW OFTEN ARE YOU SURE THAT YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WILL GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LIGHT
BUT THIS IDEA OF THE KINETIC THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPLACE AND THAT A SIMPLE JUST SHAKING IT AROUND WILL MAKE IT WORK
I THINK THAT THAT M WOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING THING
BUT I THINK WE'D ALSO WANNA GO FOR E A SIMPLE CHIP OR REGULAR CHIP TO KEEP OUR COSTS DOWN
UH WE REALLY ONLY NEED A REGULAR OR ADVANCED CHIP T IF WE'RE GONNA START USING AN L. C. D.
SO I THINK WE WANT TO BE AWARE OF NOT MAKING THINGS OVERLY T
TECHNOLOGICAL IF THEY DON'T NEED TO BE 'CAUSE THAT'LL KEEP OUR MANUFACTURING PRICE WAY DOWN
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE FOR OPTIONS
UM I'D APPRECIATE ANYONE'S INPUT BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEING FOR THE FUTURE OF THE THE LOOK OF THIS THING
I'M NOT SURE
I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY SPECIFIC
VISUALS OF THIS YET
THIS IS WHAT I'M SORT OF
YEAH
I'M NOT SURE BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS I GET ANY PICTURES
I KNOW IF WE DO HAVE A DOUBLE CURVED CASE IT CAN'T HAVE ANY TITANIUM IN IT
BUT THE TITANIUM THEY WERE QUITE THEY'RE MARKETING QUITE HARD TO US AS BEING USED IN THE SPACE PROGRAMME SO THAT COULD BE QUITE INTERESTING
SPACE AGE REMOTE
JUST ALL THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND
YEAH
THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAVE TO DO GUYS
I HOPE I DIDN'T GO THROUGH THAT TOO QUICKLY
YEAH N NO IDEA NO IDEA
UM
I'M ASSUMING
THAT A KINETIC BATTERY ISN'T GONNA TAKE UP THAT MUCH WEIGHT AND THAT A TITA TITANIUM IS VERY LIGHT I KNOW
UM BUT OTHER THAN THAT'S REALLY BASIC I MEAN THAT'S ALL I HAVE GOTTEN SO FAR
ALRIGHT
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
NO
OKAY
I HAVE SAVE THIS IN THE UH SHARED PROJECTS IF ANYONE WANTS TO LOOK AND I HAVE C CONSIDERABLE NOTES ON THE TOPIC AS WELL
IF ANYONE NEEDS ANY MORE INFORMATION
UH
JUST IN MY NOTEBOOK BUT IF ANYONE HAS ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS DON'T HESITATE TO EMAIL ME OR SOMETHING
ALRIGHT
UH I GUESS I CAN
I KNOW
G OH GEEZ
HMM
HMM
SO YOU'D BE ADVOCATING AN L. C. D. THEN
OKAY
MM-HMM
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
MM-HMM
'KAY
WELL
ARE YOU ARE YOU TAK
YEAH
NO I THINK I THINK WE'RE TALKING MENU LIKE CONTRAST AND TUNING THE V. C. R. OR SOMETHING IF I'VE UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY RATHER THAN MENU AS WHAT'S ON
OH GOOD POINT
YEAH
NO SIGNAL
OOP THERE WE GO
OKAY
MM
THAT THERE'S ALL KINDS OF SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION IN THAT ONE THOUGH
IF IT'S LATEX IF IT'S LATEXY
UM MEAN
AN UH I IF TH MY UNDERSTANDING OF A LATEX CASE IS THAT IT'S IN FACT HARD TO PROTECT STUFF INSIDE
BUT THAT IT'S COVERED WITH THE LATEX WHICH IS SPONGIER AND SOFTER ON YOUR HANDS
IT'S THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID I MEAN WE WE GOT THAT THING EARLIER FROM YOU ABOUT UM NOT WANTING IT TO
R. R. REPETITIVE STRESS INJURIES AND THINGS AND AND
YEAH SOMETHING GRIPPABLE I MEAN WE DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T WANNA GO SPONGY MAYBE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK THAT GIVEN THE LIST OF MATERIALS I W I WAS FORWARDED IT'S THAT SEEMS DOABLE
COULD WE GO IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOURS
WE COULD COLOUR CO ORDINATE THEM LI
THE BUTTONS COULD BE FRUIT SHAPED
OH WELL IT'S QUITE EASY TO S SHAPE THING LIKE CARROT ISN'T IT
OR MAYBE THE BUTTONS COULD BE SHAPED LIKE DIFFERENT FRUITS
BE YEAH
IT'D BE HARDER TO F BU UH BUTTONS I THINK
IT'D BE HARDER TO PRESS BUTTON
UM
I
YEAH THAT'S TS HOW I TEND TO DO IT
NO JUST THUMB SIZED
JUS
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
RIGHT
I WHEN I'M WHEN I'M PRESSING BUTTONS ON MY IPOD THAT'S HOW I DO IT HOLD IT AND PRESS THE FOUR
YEAH
YEAH OR IN AND USE MY THUMB OR MY POINTER FINGER ON THE TOUCH SCROLL WHEEL
YEAH
IT WEL WELL YEAH IT WOULD I MEAN EACH VERSION OF IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT
OH YEAH YOU HAD ONE OF THE IN BETWEEN ONES WHEN THEY WEREN'T DOING THAT ANYMORE
TS AND YOU PRESS THE CENTRE BUTTON THAT'S THAT'S YOUR ALL PURPOSE SELECT BUTTON RIGHT THERE
SINCE IT'S THE ONE IN THE CENTRE THAT'S NOT MARKED YEAH
YEAH
UH UH T
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
YEAH I THINK AN L. C. D. SCREEN MIGHT BE GOOD IN THEORY BUT NOT AS USEFUL IN PRACTICE
YEAH
RIGHT
UM
OH WE PROBABLY HAVE TO GET GOING DON'T WE
'KAY
COULD
COULD WE UH COULD WE HAVE CHANGEABLE COVERS LIKE FOR YOUR MOBILE
IN DIFFERENT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COLOURS YEAH
EXACTLY
AND YOU COULD CO ORDINATE WITH YOUR HOUSE OR WHATEVER
ALL THESE OPTIONS
OOH
OH
YEAH
MM
OPTIONS
UH HU OH OH YES
RIGHT I HAD SORT OF SKIPPED OVER THAT HOPING IT WOULDN'T GET
BE NECESSARY BUT UM
ALRIGHT SO UM DECISIONS WHAT THE OKAY DECI DECISIONS ON ENERGY I'M THINKING IS BASED ON THE BATTERY
UM I DUNNO WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THIS KINETIC BATTERY IDEA
AM I
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY YEAH ANY MORE INFORMATION ON COST OTHER THAN IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A REGULAR BATTERY
BUT UM BUT IF WE'RE USING A AN I A CHEAPER CHIP THEN IT'LL EVEN OUT I THINK
UM CIRCUIT BOARDS
UM YEAH I GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF INFORMATION ON HOW CIRCUIT BOARDS ARE PRODUCED
THEY'RE THEY'RE THIN FIBREGLASS WITH COPPER WIRES ETCHED ON TO THEM AND DI I THINK THEY'RE QUITE EASILY PRINTED ON BY MACHINE
WHICH IS CHIP ON PRINT IS WHERE THE MACHINE PRINTS ON THE WIRES AND SOLDERS IT ALL TOGETHER FOR US
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU AS FAR AS DECISIONS
I WASN'T REALLY GIVEN ANY OPTIONS I WAS JUST GIVEN THAT THIS IS HOW THEY'RE DONE
UM
YEAH I CAN'T CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU
I CAN I CAN TELL YOU A WHOLE LOT ABOUT HOW IT WORKS
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY DECISIONS ON
YEAH
I'M SORRY I DID F
YEAH
RIGHT
WELL OKAY HERE'S THE HERE'S THE THING ON THE CHIPS THAT I THAT I GOT
UM SIMPLE REGULAR ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
THE CHIP ON PRINT INCLUDES AN INFRARED SENSOR SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
UM
'KAY THE PUSHBUTTON IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE PUSHBUTTONS THEY REQUIRE A SIMPLE CHIP BUT A SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES A REGULAR CHIP AND AN L. C. D. REQUIRES ADVANCED
DO WE WANT A SCROLL WHEEL OR DO WE JUST WANT PUSHBUTTONS
OH
YEAH TH IT'D BE IT'D BE HANDY FOR GOING THROUGH IF THERE WAS AN ON SCREEN MENU OF YOUR CHANNEL CHOICES THAN YOU CAN SCROLL DOWN ON THE SCROLL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
F OR FOR ALL THOSE SECRET FUNCTIONS
WHEN YOU GET ON THE ON SCREEN MENU OF ALL YOUR FUNCTIONS THAT YOUR REMOTE COULD DO FOR YOU WITHOUT THE BUTTONS AND YOU COULD HAVE A SCROLL WHEEL TO GO THROUGH THOSE MENUS
RIGHT
SO WE COULD EITHER GO WITH A SIMPLE OR A REGULAR CHIP DEPENDING AND MAYBE WE COULD TABLE THAT DECISION FOR LATER
I DON'T KNOW
OKAY
WELL LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT WHILE WE TALK ABOUT THE CASE
UH I'M KINDA LIKING THE IDEA OF LATEX IF IF SPONGY IS THE IN THING
OKAY
UH YEAH EVERYTHING I'VE
N OH WHA WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE SEEN JUST NOT RELATED TO THIS BUT OF LATEX CASES BEFORE
IS THAT THERE'S UH LIKE A HARD PLASTIC INSIDE AND IT'S JUST COVERED WITH THE LATEX
NOT TOO THICK A LAYER OF LATEX JUST ENOUGH TO BE GRIPPABLE LIKE BIKE HANDLES OR OR ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE SEEN LIKE THAT
THE INSIDE IS HARD
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT PROTECTING THE CIRCUIT BOARD I THINK THAT THAT'S DONE FOR US
YEAH
YEAH
OH AND WE WANT A CURVED CASE YEAH
OR A DOUBLE CURVED
YEAH OKAY
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE
GOOD POINT
YEAH
I SAY PUSHBUTTONS AT LEAST UNLESS WE GET ANY INFORMATION BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE A SCROLL WHEEL IS THAN THAN A PUSHBUTTON
BUT IT'S GOTTA BE SOME MORE EXPENSIVE SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO PUT OUR MONEY INTO THE STUFF LIKE THE KINETIC BATTERY AND THE COOL CASE
BECAUSE
YEAH
OH
ALRIGHT
SO WHAT ARE WHAT ARE OUR BUTTONS GONNA BE
ON OFF
SO LIKE ONE THROUGH FIVE OR
NO
MM
YEAH UP DOWN
OOH
SIMPLE CHIP
OKAY COOL
CLAY
YEP
UH-HUH
DON'T THINK SO
JESS
ALRIGHT SO I'M GONNA DESCRIBE THE THE CONCEPT OF THE USER INTERFACE OF THIS DES DEVICE
UM WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UH THE TWO ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF THE USER INTERFACE
WE WANT IT TO BE SIMPLE AND WE WANT IT TO BE FASHIONABLE
UM
OTHER WE'VE ALSO GOT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A DEVICE THAT SERVES AS A USEFUL PURPOSE
UH WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT S AS A REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE D OF THE DEVICE ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE THAT WE'VE INCLUDED ALL OF THOSE AND THAT WE ACTUALLY END UP WITH A DEVICE THAT IS GOING TO BE USEFUL TO PEOPLE
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHOICES FOR A DESIGN CONCEPT UM AND S THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT I'LL SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF UM
BUT ESSENTIALLY WE NEED TO CHOOSE HOW HOW IS THIS DEVICE GOING TO WORK
HOW HOW WHAT KIND OF MODEL IS THERE GOING TO BE FOR USER INTERACTION WITH THIS DEVICE
UH ONCE WE'VE CHOSEN A A CONCEPT FOR IT WE CAN THEN DESIGN THE FEATURES AROUND THE CONCEPT
MAKING SURE THAT WE GET ALL THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS IN THE DEVICE AND UH THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS AND THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES
AND OF COURSE WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK COOL
SO BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T WANT
M WE DON'T WANT LOTS OF BUTTONS UH COMPLICATED FEATURES
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS NICE AND SIMPLE
HERE'S A A FAIRLY SIMPLE DEVICE
THIS IS AN AN IPOD FROM APPLE
UM I THINK THE MAIN THING TO NOTICE ABOUT IT IS IT JUST HAS FOUR BUTTONS
IT'S VERY MINIMALISTIC IN ITS DESIGN
UH YOU USE THESE FOUR BUTTONS TO M TO MOVE AROUND A RANGE OF SETTINGS ON THE SMALL L. C. D. SCREEN
UM THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THIS IS THAT
IT'S VERY VERY QUICK TO ACCESS THE MAIN FEATURES
UH YOU CAN JUST ABOUT MAKE OUT UH THAT THE BUTTON THREE BUTTONS ARE UH PREVIOUS TRACK NEXT TRACK AND PLAY PAUSE
THEY'RE THE MAIN THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE IPOD THE THINGS YOU WILL USE A ALL THE TIME
UM THEN IF YOU WANT TO DO ANYTHING MORE ADVANCED
YOU GO INTO THE LITTLE MENU ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND YOU USE THE BUTTONS JUST TO SCROLL AROUND AND AND FIND THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES THAT YOU WANT
SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD A GOOD KIND OF MODEL THAT WE COULD HAVE
UM
HERE'S A ANOTHER EXAMPLE
THIS IS UH IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA AND I THINK I IT LOOKS PRETTY COOL
UM IT'S CERTAINLY GOT NOVELTY VALUE
UH IT'S NICE AND COLOURFUL IT'S NICE AND BRIGHT
UH IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN KIND OF FEEL YOUR WAY AROUND
THE BUTTONS ARE ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND AND YOU CAN SORT OF YEAH IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. IN THE DARK OR WHATEVER
YOU CAN WORK OUT WHICH BUTTON'S WHICH AND BASICALLY YEAH IT'S ITH IT'S FUN
SO I I LIKE I LIKE THIS IDEA OF JUST HAVING BUTTONS FOR THE FEATURES THAT YOU USE MOST OFTEN
SO YOU'D NEED A FEW BUTTONS TO SELECT YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS
I MEAN MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY WATCH T. V.
THEY HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHANNELS ON THEIR T. V. AND THEY WATCH OF 'BOUT FOUR OF THEM AT THE MOST
SO YOU HAVE BUTTONS FOR YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL CHANGING THE VOLUME
WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU DO ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. AND THE BUTTON TO SWITCH IT OFF IN CASE YOU GET BORED
UM OTHER FEATURES THINGS LIKE ADJUSTING THE BRIGHTNESS TUNING THE T. V. UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU DO WITH A T. V.
UM BUT THESE ARE THESE ARE ALL NECESSARY FUNCTIONS
UH YOU CAN'T HAVE A T THERE'S NO POINT HAVING A TELEVISION THAT YOU CAN'T TUNE OR THAT YOU CAN'T SET THE CONTRAST
SO WE NEED TO FIND A WAY OF INCLUDING THESE SOMEHOW
UM AND ONE OTHER SUGGESTIONS I'D MAKE IS TO IN IS TO INCLUDE IN A MENU SYSTEM A BIT LIKE ON THE IPOD
SO WE'D EITHER HAVE A SMALL L. C. D. DISPLAY ON THE DEVICE ITSELF
OR UH HAVE A DIS A MENU DISPLAY THAT COMES UP ON YOUR TELEVISION AND CAN B BE CONTROLLED THROUGH THE DEVICE
AND THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS ACCESS THE ADVANCED FEATURES UH WHILST KEEPING A VERY SMALL AND SIMPLE SET OF BUTTONS FOR THE FEATURES THAT YOU USE MOST OFTEN
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE WAY TO GO YES
UM I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES IF YOU IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY IT'S IT'S NICE
BECAUSE IT'S IT IT LETS YOU JUST SORT OF SIT THERE AND ST AND CONTROL YOUR TELEVISION FROM YOUR ARMCHAIR
THERE ARE DISADVANTAGES AN AN L. C. D. DISPLAY WOULD HAVE TO BE QUITE SMALL
'CAUSE WE'RE WE'RE I WELL WE'RE I ASSUME WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING QUITE A SMALL DEVICE
UM IT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO HAVE UH A KIND OF BACKLIGHTING IN IT
'CAUSE YOU TEN YOU TEND TO WATCH T. V. IN THE DARK BUT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR L. D. D. L. C. D. DISPLAY
THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO HAVE A AN ON SCREEN DISPLAY ON YOUR TELEVISION THAT YOU CONTROL THROUGH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
UH
A BIT LIKE A BIT LIKE HOW THEY HAVE THESE UM DIGITAL BOXES WHERE YOU YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS AND IT COMES UP WITH YOUR THIS THING OF WATCH LO WHAT'S ON EACH CHANNEL
I MEAN THAT THAT'S ALSO A GOOD IDEA
IT'S IT CAN IT DOES HAVE IT'S PROBLEMS AS WELL
IF YOU'VE GOT A SMALL T. V. AND YOU'RE SITTING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A ROOM IT'S HARD TO READ THE LITTLE TEXT THAT COMES UP
UH BUT THAT'S A THAT'S A DESIGN DECISION THAT WE CAN MAKE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE FEATURES YES
BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING TO BEAR IN MIND IS THAT IF WE PUT A DISPLAY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
THE C UH COMMUNICATION IS ONE WAY SO YOU CAN'T HAVE THE TELEVISIONS AND INFORMATION BACK TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AT LEAST I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
UM I'M NOT SURE
IS THAT GOING ON
OKAY
UH THAT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT ACTUALLY
A KIND OF THING THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE SHAPED LIKE A VEGETABLE
UH LIKE UH I DUNNO LIKE UH CARROTS OR SOMETHING
MAYBE OR
KIND OF LIKE A POTATO
YEAH
DEPENDS
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU USE A REMOTE DO YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB USUALLY
OR YOUR FINGERS
OR MAYBE YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S SHAPED LIKE A MOBILE PHONE SO YOU YOU HOLD IT IN ONE HAND AND YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB
YEAH
MAYBE
BUT IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT LIKE FOUR OR FIVE BUTTONS ANYWAY THEN IT'S IT'S NOT SO MUCH A PROBLEM PERHAPS
SO YOU HOLD IT IN ONE HAND AND YOU PRESS YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB AND
AND YOU FIND THAT WORKS QUITE WELL
IS THAT THE BUTTON ON AN IPOD IS IT WHAT IS IT IS IT JUST FOUR BUTTONS OR IS IT LI MORE LIKE A SCROLL THING
RIGHT
OH I SEE RIGHT YEAH
OH OKAY
YEAH THAT'S QUITE A GOOD DESIGN
YEAH
I THINK IT COULD BE DIFFICULT IN PRACTICE YEAH
ALSO Z YEAH 'CAUSE YOU WOULD BE Z LOOKING DOWN AT THE L. C. D. SCREEN THAN BACK UP AT YOUR T. V. AND PEOPLE DON'T WANNA DO THAT
LIKE TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT FRUITS
YEAH IT'S POSSIBLE
I THINK MAYBE TH THE PACKAGING IT SHOULD BE LIKE A LEMON AND THE THE PACKAGING IS LIKE THE PEEL
SO INSTEAD OF OPENING THE BOX YOU JUST KIND OF PEEL IT AND THE REMOTE CONTROL'S INSIDE
DON'T KNOW
YEAH UM I THINK IT'S GOOD AS AS LONG AS WE CONSIDER THE THE COST AND THE UH HOW RELIABLE IT IS
BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOOD
AL ALL CIRCUIT BOARDS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME I THINK
UH IT'S FAIRLY FAIRLY STANDARD
UM
I DON'T THINK WE NE REALLY NEED THE SCROLL WHE WHEEL
I MEAN IT MIGHT BE NICE FOR CHANGING THE VOLUME
UH BUT
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD REALLY WORK
YEAH YOU REALLY NEED BUTTONS FOR CHANGING A CHANNEL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK YEAH I THINK A SCROLL WHEEL WOULD BE NICE BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY
UM
YEAH
'KAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
YEP
UM
AND I THINK IF WE WANNA KEEP OUR COSTS DOWN WE SHOULD JUST GO FOR PUSHBUTTONS
'CAUSE THEN WE CAN HAVE A A SIMPLE CHIP AND IT'S SIMPLER IT'S IT'S CHEAPER TO MAKE PUSHBUTTONS THAN IT IS A SCROLL BUTTON
SO IN TERMS OF UH IN TERMS OF UH ECONOMICS IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO HAVE PUSHBUTTONS
YEAH YEAH IT'S UH IT'S IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE
YEAH
YEAH
INTERESTING
YEP
UH WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SUPPLEMENTS EXACTLY
UM
YEP
YEAH
UM IN
YEAH
ON OFF UH VOLUME FAVOURITE CHANNELS UH AND MENU
YEAH YEAH ABOUT YEAH LIKE YEAH A BIT LIKE RADIO PRESETS
UM
UH WE WOULDN'T EVEN NEED THE NUMBERS
I THINK MAYBE NUMBERS SEEMS IS KIND OF OLD FASHIONED
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN JUST AND YOU NEED SOME KIND OF I DUNNO
SORT OF UP DOWN KIND OF BUTTON BUT THE VOLUME CONTROL COULD DOUBLE FOR THAT FOR EXAMPLE
COOL
YEP
CLAY
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT
FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX
IS DOUBLE CURVED LIKE WOULD BE LIKE TWO HANDS KIND OF THING
OKAY
'CAUSE I'M IMAGINING LIKE DOUBLE CURVED IS LIKE YOU KNOW
LIKE TWO SIDES THAT CURVE AND THEN LIKE ONE CURVE WOULD JUST BE LIKE A SINGLE VERTICAL ISH KIND OF LOOKING THING BUT I'VE NO IDEA
SOUNDS GOOD
THANKS
WAIT BUT IS THAT SEPARATE FROM WHAT HE WAS SAYING
SHOULD I PLUG THAT IN
MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT IS IT ON
RI WHAT F. DO YOU HAVE TO PRESS FIVE
I JUST KEEP PRESSING LOTS OF 'EM
WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW RELEVANT ALL OF THIS GONNA BE
IF ANYTHING THE THAT THEY GAVE ME
ALRIGHT
OH YEAH
OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK A LITTLE BIT AT TREND WATCHING
BASICALLY I WAS GIVEN UM AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THAT WAS A MARKET INVESTIGATION ON REMOTE CONTROLS THAT WAS RECENTLY CONDUCTED
AND THEN ALSO SOME FASHION WATCHERS IN PARIS AND MILAN COMMENTED ON SOME THINGS THAT ARE GONNA BE GOING ON THIS YEAR
SO FIRST UM THEY HAD PEOPLE THEY RANKED UM THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF R REMOTE CONTROLS
AND RIGHT NOW I D THEY'RE SAYING THAT CURRENTLY THERE'S A FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL PREFERENCE
BUT THAT REALLY OVER THE NEXT YEAR IT IT THAT'S GONNA BE SWITCHING TO FANCY LOOK AND FEEL REMOTES SO THAT JUST GOES BACK TO
THE WHOLE DESIRE OF OUR C REAL REACTION COMPANY WANTING TO FOCUS ON FASHION AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STRESSING WHEN WE'RE TALKING
WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS LIKE SIMPLICITY AND EASY TO USE IDEA
THEY'RE SORT OF WANTING US TO REMEMBER THAT THE NUMBER ONE THING FOR EVERYONE IS THAT IT'S FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
AND AS THESE ARE RANKED THE TOP ONE IS DOUBLY IMPORTANT TO THE SECOND ONE
WHICH IS DOUBLY IMPORTANT TO THE THIRD ONE SO JUST TO TAKE THAT WEIGHT INTO ACCOUNT
THE SECOND THING THAT WAS MENTIONED AS IMPORTANT WAS THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS
THAT WOULD BE LIKE IF WE USE SOMETHING LIKE THE SPACE MATERIAL OR THE L. C. D. SCREEN THINGS LIKE THAT
AND THEN EASE OF USE WAS THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT WHI SO REALLY
NO MATTER WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS THE MOST ON FANCY LOOK AND FEEL ACCORDING TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE AGREE WITH THAT
AND THEN THE FASHION WATCH TALKS ABOUT THAT THIS YEAR'S TOP TREND FOR CLOTHES
SHOES AND FURNITURE IS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND THA THAT THERE'S A PREFERENCE FOR SPONGY TIGHT MATERIAL
AND SO THAT BRINGS US TO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
WHO WANTS A SPONGY REMOTE OR ONE WITH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PADDING
PERSONALLY I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT I WANT ONE THAT'S GONNA GO OUT OF STYLE OR GO STALE EXCUSE THE PUN UM IN A YEAR SO
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS COMING FROM US AS YOU KNOW TREND WATCH MARKET RESEARCH I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT WE NECESSARILY WANNA TAKE AWAY
ALSO CONSIDERING THAT THE D RESEARCH B HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT BY REAL REACTION I'M A LITTLE HESITANT AS TO LIKE
HOW THESE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN WORDED AND IF NECESSARILY THIS WHOLE FASHION TO TECHNOLOGY Y EDAS EASE OF USE IS NECESSARILY THE RIGHT RANKING
PERSONALLY LIKE I MIGHT REVERSE IT BUT IF WE'RE WORKING FOR THIS COMPANY THEN I GUESS NO MATTER WHAT WE HAVE TO STRESS FASHION THE MOST
BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE A SPONGY MATERIAL
YEAH
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF NOTES TO SHARE IF YOU WANT THEM THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP
SO YEAH
YEAH WHAT CAN I POSSIBLY ENLIGHTEN ON
MM-HMM
YEAH SO SOMETHING M M INSTEAD OF A NECESS YEAH GRIP I'M THINKING GRIP MORE THAN LIKE SINKING INTO YOUR HANDS
YOU KNOW I AND I THINK I'M ENVISIONING MORE LIKE
YOU KNOW THE MATERIAL THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU SIT ON LIKE A BICYCLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T HURT WHEN YOU'RE SITTING DOWN FOR A LONG TIME
LIKE I'M IMAGINING THAT SORT OF THING I DON'T KNOW WHAT TH THAT MATERIAL'S CALLED
OH GOD
WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA OF LIKE A ROUND REMOTE
INSTEAD OF LIKE A VERTICAL UP AND DOWN ONE
LIKE IN TERMS OF HOLDING IT
LIKE THAT'S A F SHAPE OF A FRUIT
JUST TO TIE IT IN A LITTLE
YEAH
YEAH 'CAUSE OTHERWISE YOUR FINGERS CAN'T MOVE AROUND
BUT I LIKE I
I LOVE THE IDEA OF THE WHEEL LIKE THE IPOD
'CAUSE TH
IT'S LIKE FIVE 'CAUSE THERE'S ONE IN THE MIDDLE
I THINK WHY IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US IS 'CAUSE LIKE YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME WHEEL SORT OF EFFECT FOR LIKE CHANNEL FLIPPING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE COULD BE LIKE FOR VOLUME
LIKE JUST THE IDEA OF LIKE THOSE SO FEW BUTTONS FOR MAIN THINGS BUT THEN HOW YOU COULD GO BACK TO THE MENU AND LIKE
I DUNNO IF WE WOULD WANT IT ON THE SCREEN THERE OR ON THE ACTUAL T. V.
I KIND OF AM WANTING TO SAY ON THE T. V. 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE CHANGING THE BRIGHTNESS DON'T YOU WANNA SEE IT HAPPENING KIND OF
AND THEN YOU COULD STILL HAVE THAT AVAILABLE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
IF I GET ANY MORE INFORMATION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WELL THERE WE GO
THE IPOD PACKAGING IS ME LIKE WAS SO THAT WAS LIKE HALF THE FUN
IT'S LIKE THE WAY IT ALL COMES ALL CUTE
LEMONS
YEAH I MEAN IT WOULD
T TOTALLY TAKE CARE OF OUR PROBLEM OF NOT WANTING TO CHANGE BATTERIES
COSTS
BUT OVER TIME
YEAH IT'S A
BUT IF YOU C IF YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH THE CHANNELS AND THEN THE VOLUME WOULD JUST BE
AND THE VOLUME WOULD JUST BE LIKE THE SAME WAY FORWARD AND BACKWARD AS I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH LIKE SLEEKER SORT OF LOOKING
AND OTHERWISE NO MATTER HOW MAY BUTTONS WE HAVE WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW
BLACK WITH RED STICKING OUT AND TH NO IT'S GONNA INEVITABLY SORT OF START LOOKING LIKE THOSE GROUP OF SORT OF UGLY ONES THAT WE SAW STACKED UP
OH COULD IT BE HARD AND THEN SOMETHING AROUND IT
I'M THINKING CURVED OF SOME SORT
YEAH
AND LET'S LIKE SEE IF WE GET ANYTHING ELSE
I MEAN I'M NOT LIKE HARD SOLD ON THE SCROLL WHEEL IT'S MORE JUST TO GIVE IT A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOOK
BUT IF IT'S GONNA BE IN A LATEX TYPE THING AND THAT'S GONNA LOOK COOL THEN THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT THAN THE SCROLL WHEEL
LIKE A RADIO TYPE SORTA SITUATION
WOW
OKAY UM
WELCOME TO OUR DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
I'M PRETTY EXCITED
LET'S START IT'S APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN FORTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY UM THE AGENDA WE'RE GONNA DO AN OPENING AND THEN UM I'LL TALK ABOUT THE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING
WHAT WE D DISCUSSED UM THEN WE'LL HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION AND A LOOK AT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA
WE'LL LOOK AT THE FINANCES AND FINALLY A DO A PRODUCTION EVALUATION AND CLOSE
SO STARTING OFF WITH THE UM LAST THE LAST ONE OH I DON'T HAVE IT HERE UM BUT WE TALKED ABOUT ENERGY
WE'RE GONNA USE A KINETIC BATTERY UM WE WANT TO USE A SIMPLE CHIP BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA NEED A A SHUFFLE UM
WE'RE GONNA NEED A SCROLL UM
WE'RE CHOOSING A LATEX CASE W IN FRUITY COLOURS THAT'S CURVED AND UM WE'RE USING PUSH BUTTONS UH WITH A SUPPLEMENT OF AN ON SCREEN MENU
AND IT SOUNDED LIKE WE HAD SET UM LIKE EIGHT OR NINE BUTTONS INCLUDING FIVE PRE SET CHANNELS
OKAY
LET'S DO THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN PRESENTATION FIRST
LIKE A LITTLE LIGHTNING IN IT
THE LITTLE LIGHTNING BOLT IN IT VERY CUTE
THE V THE RHOMBUS RHOMBUS
UM ON OFF
OKAY
YEAH WE TURN IT OFF
MM-HMM
OKAY
UH-HUH
VERY INTERESTING
I THINK THAT ONE'S MY FAVOURITE
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
NOW THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WE BROUGHT UP OVER EMAIL
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU PICKED UP YOUR EMAIL BUT UM THE F THE UM FEATURE THAT WE CONSIDERED FOR IT NOT GETTING LOST
MM-HMM
IT'S REALLY
WOULD IT BE VERY DIFFICULT TO UM JUST HAVE AN EXTERNAL DEVICE THAT LIKE I DUNNO
YOU TAPE TO YOUR TO YOUR T. V. UM THAT WHEN YOU PRESS IT YOU HA A LITTLE LIGHT BEEP GOES OFF
DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE CONCEPTUALLY POSSIBLE
MM-HMM
MM
THAT'S TRUE MM 'KAY
MM-HMM
OKAY THAT'S A FAIR EVALUATION
GETTING LOST
UM WE SO WE DO WE'VE DECIDED NOT TO WORRY ABOUT THAT FOR NOW
OKAY 'CAUSE WELL THE DESIGNS ARE VERY BRIGHT SO YOU'RE RIGHT THEY'RE GONNA STICK OUT BUT UM
MM-HMM
COULD WE MAYBE HAVE LIKE AN EXTRA BUTTON ON THE TOP FOR ON OFF
SO THEN W WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A DUAL FUNCTION
SURE
UM UH WHY DON'T WE DO A PRODUCT EVALUATION USING YOUR CRITERIA IF YOU'VE DEVELOPED SOME
OH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
DO YOU NEED THIS OR JUST WRITE ON THE WHITE BOARD
OKAY
IT'S KIND OF LIKE UH LIKE A JOYSTICK KIND OF THING YOU KNOW KINDA PUSH IT
'KAY
MAYBE A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THAT
OH IT DOES IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THERE IT COULD HAVE A STEM LIKE THAT 'CAUSE I DO L KIND OF LIKE THE STEM
YEAH
IT ALMOST HELPS YOU GE KEEP A GRIP TOO 'CAUSE IT GOES IN BETWEEN FINGERS
I LIKE THIS ONE
VARIETY OF COLOURS ARE NICE
I THINK I'M LEANING TOWARDS THE POTATO
MM-HMM
I AM WORRIED ABOUT LIKE UM USING A MENU
UM IN THAT LIKE I WITHING MENUS THERE ARE SUBMENUS AND SO HOW DO YOU GET BACK TO THE MAIN MENU
BUT THAT HAS A MENU BUTTON SEPARATE FROM A SELECT BUTTON WHEREAS IF THIS ONE'S BOTH THE MENU AND THE SELECT BUTTON
OKAY
COULD THESE BE USED FOR GOING TO SUBMENUS OR
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL AS LONG AS WE HAVE THAT IN MIND AS WE'RE DESIGNING IT STILL MM 'KAY
I THINK SO
I I KIND OF THINK IT'S IT'S UNIQUE ENOUGH THAT I'D GIVE IT A ONE OR A TWO
OKAY
I WILL GIVE IT A ONE
UM FUNCTIONAL
I THINK IT'LL GET EVERYTHING DONE I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE CONFUSING AT FIRST UM I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GONNA BE A LATER ONE
OKAY THEN I'M GONNA GIVE IT A TWO
DID YOU GIVE A FUNCTIONAL
OKAY
WELL THE KINETIC BATTERY
BUT THEY'LL NOTICE IT AFTER LIKE A YEAR THEY'LL BE LIKE HEY I HAVE NEVER CHANGED THE BATTERY
MM
JUST THE MATERIAL
THINK I'M GONNA GO WITH THE FOUR AS WELL
I REALLY LIKE THAT KINETIC BATTERY THOUGH
MM 'KAY
UH LET'S SAY TWO
GIVE IT A ONE
MM
'CAUSE THERE WOULD BE LESS IMPACT MAYBE
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH CORPORATE COLOUR
WE DIDN'T KEEP THAT IN UM WELL IF WE I KNOW IT WOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE LESS C A LITTLE MORE CONFUSING
BUT IF WE HAD ALL THE BUTTONS IN BLACK AND A DESIGN IN AND THE OUTSIDE IN YELLOW
THAT'D BE OUR CORPORATE ONE AND WE COULD ALSO HAVE ALTERNATIVE COLOURS ONE A MORE CONSERVATIVE ONE ONE THAT'S MORE FRUITY
UM AND CAN WE HAVE LIKE AN R. R. INSCRIBED ON THE BOTTOM OR SOMETHING
OKAY
FRUITY SO FRUITY
I THINK I IT'S KIND OF MANGOEY TOO
YES
MM
ONE
MM-HMM
YES
IT'S GONNA BE HARD
AND IF IT'S REPETITIVE MOVEMENT IT IS GONNA BE ONLY FOUR BUTTONS THAT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY PUSHING BUT UM
I LIKE HOW IT FITS IN THE HAND THOUGH SO I I'D GO WITH A TWO
MM
MM
MM-HMM
I THINK I'D GIVE IT A FOUR TOO
IT'S A PRETTY HIGH LEARNING CURVE IT'LL BE EASY ONCE YOU'VE DONE IT BUT
WE WE I THINK WE CAN KIND OF SAY WE ADDRESSED IT WITH COLOUR BUT
MM-HMM
MM I'D GIVE IT A FOUR
SMALL TOO
THREE
IT'S TOTALLY FASHIONABLE
I'D GIVE IT A ONE
MANGO
I DO LIKE UH THE LITTLE MARTIAN ONE
ONE
MM-HMM
I THINK AS LONG IF WE OFFER IN A IN AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT COLOUR ARRANGEMENTS
UM YEAH THAT'S GOOD
SO I'LL GIVE IT A A TWO
WELL UM WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T ADDRESS THE FACT THAT IT DOES NEED TO B HAVE A CORPORATE LOGO
SO LET'S LET'S MAKE SURE WE KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT WE HA THAT ONE OF OUR COLOURS CONCEPTS IS CORPORATE AND HAS AN R. R. ON IT
ALL OF THEM SHOULD HAVE R. R. YEAH
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
LOVELY
OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT FINANCES
UM I HAVE AN EXCEL SHEET THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA CALCULATE THE COST UM
SO LET ME EXIT OUT OF THIS FIRST
OKAY UM
I KNOW
LET ME ONE MORE SPACE
GONNA ZOOM IN REAL QUICK
OKAY
HAND DYNAMO
WE'RE USING KINETIC BATTERY RIGHT
UM AND WE'RE HAVING ONE PER
ONE OKAY
UM ELECTRONICS
SIMPLE
MM 'KAY
UM THE CASE
IT'S VERY CURVY SO OKAY
THE WOOD
I MEAN THE RUBBER
MM-HMM OKAY
YEAH WE'RE USING WE'RE GONNA NEED AT LEAST TWO SPECIAL COLOURS
UM
I DUNNO WHERE IT YEAH
SO LET'S Y SAY THREE
YEAH I DUNNO
THAT I THI I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE UNDER YOURS
WE'LL JUST SAY THREE
MM-HMM
MAYBE THE R. R. WILL BE IN COLOUR AS WELL SO YEAH
INTERFACE WE'RE DOING PUSH BUTTONS
AND HOW MANY BUTTONS DO WE HAVE
SIX
ANYTHING ELSE
OH BUTTONS OH SO UM
SO THE CASE MATERIAL WILL JUST HAVE ONE COLOUR RIGHT BUT THEN THE BUTTONS WILL BE IN SPECIAL COLOURS
WE'RE SAYING PER UNIT
OKAY SO EACH UNIT WILL ONLY HAVE ONE COLOUR ON THEIR BUT THE CASE IS
COULD HAVE UP TO THR I MEAN THE BUTTONS COULD EA COULD BE UP TO THREE COLOURS 'CAUSE THAT HOW IT'S DESIGNED THERE
SO
SPECIAL FORM
THEY'RE ALL KIND OF JUST PUSH BUTTON RIGHT
SPECIAL MATERIAL
UH
OH DO I HAVE TO DO IT PER BUTTON DO I
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN
YEAH WHAT CAN WE REDUCE
LET'S SEE WHAT THAT WOULD DO
IT'S ONLY GONNA BRING US DOWN TO THIRTEEN POINT THREE ANYWAY
OKAY UM ARE WE SURE THIS IS DOUBLE CURVED
MAYBE IT'S SINGLE CURVED WE HAVE NO IDEA
WELL IT'S NOT THE YEAH
OKAY IT'S THE KINETIC BATTERY THAT'S KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT WE HAVE A SIMPLE CHIP SINGLE CURVE
CASE MATERIAL IS RUBBER AND IT'S A SPECIAL COLOUR BUT THAT'S IMPORTANT
SIX BUTTONS WE HAVE TO HAVE SIX BUTTONS
WHAT
NO OKAY MAYBE NOT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT JUST HAPPENED
NOW IT'S TWELVE
TWELVE POINT FIVE
SO WE'RE OKAY I THINK
YEAH
OKAY WE'RE ALL SET
UM SAVE
I SAVED THAT TO OUR UM OUR BIG SHARED FOLDER SO YOU KNOW
UM OKAY BACK TO AGENDA
UM ARE THE ARE THE COSTS UNDER TWELVE FIFTY EURO
YES
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION
PROJECT PROCESS
SATISFACTION WITH FOR EXAMPLE THE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK THE MEANS ANY NEW IDEAS FOUND
SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT HERE IS JUST EVALUATING HOW WE CREATED THIS PROJECT THE INFORMATION WE GOT ON THE NEWS
HOW WE USED IT IF WE WERE ABLE TO UM YOU KNOW USE OUR CREATIVITY WITH THE INFORMATION
UM HOW HOW WELL I GUESS I LED IT UM THE HOW WELL WE WORKED TOGETHER AS A TEAM UM THE DIGITAL PENS THE WHITEBOARD
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I THINK WE ALL MADE UM VERY SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DOMINATED IT WHICH I THOUGHT WAS REALLY GOOD
LIKE EACH OF US WAS ABLE TO UM LIKE EACH OF YOU HAD YOUR INFORMATION AND I UH I TRIED TO FACILITATE IT WITHOUT LIKE TAKING OVER UM
I LIKE OUR LITTLE FINISHED PRODUCTS
REALLY CUTE
I KNOW LET'S THINK OF IT LIKE A LITTLE JINGLE
UM
OKAY UM NEW IDEAS FOUND
DEFINITELY
OR OR AT LEAST BE C P CREATIVE ENOUGH TO THINK OF TOGGLE SWITCHES MM
ETCETERA
OH I'M SO EXCITED
MM-HMM
I THI YEAH THAT'S AWESOME
UM OKAY CLOSING
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
NOW THERE'S THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY
UM SO THIS IS THE GREAT PRODUCT KIDS I THINK WE'VE CREATED SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING AND THAT WE HAVE A MARKET FOR IT
UM ESPECIALLY IF WE CAN PRODUCE IT AT TWELVE POINT THREE WHICH WE HOPE UM
YEAH
MAKE SURE IN YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE TO PUT DOWN CRITICISMS OF
BOTH THE PROCESS AND THE UM THE FINAL RESULTS AND
I DO LIKE THE MARTIAN REMOTE
IF WE COULD CHOOSE MORE THAN ONE THAT WOULD BE MY SECOND CHOICE
ALTHOUGH THE TOG TOGGLE
I'M AFRAID I WOULD
IT'S COOL
I THINK I WOULD BREAK IT
OH YEAH IT'S KIND OF A PENGUIN
MM MM
MM 'KAY CONGRATULATIONS
UM
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY
ALRIGHT
UM ANYBODY HAVE I GOT MORE MASTER CLASSES ANYBODY ELSE WANNA LIKE TAKE A MASTER'S CLASS
YEAH BUT CHECK IT OUT
SO LIKE THERE ARE ALL THESE LIKE LINKS THEY DON'T GO ANYWHERE
BUT ALL THAT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND YOUR KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
UM JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU DO
OH
IT IS
YES DEFINITELY I'M VERY SAD THAT I DIDN'T GET ANY LINKS TO THE CORPORATE WEBSITE
WOW
YES
I LOVE EXCEL IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PROGRAMS
I SEE MM
SPONGY
I I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE TRICKY HAVING TO HAND AROUND THIS THING
WE HAD A LOT OF THE UM OTHERWISE THE TECHNOLOGY TODAY WAS KINDA COOL
MM-HMM
NO
ALTHOUGH I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD HAVE VERY L AT LEAST FOR ME I
MM
MM-HMM
AND WITH AND WITH THE POWERPOINT THAT WE CAN ALL LOOK AT
LIKE YOU CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS PRETTY MUCH ON POWERPOINT AS THAT'S NOT AS NECESSARY TO HAVE
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NOW WHEN YOU WERE UM CREATING YOUR UM PROTOTYPES HERE DID YOU WORK TOGETHER OR DID YOU LIKE DO SEPARATE PROJECTS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
COOL
OH THANKS
IT'S KINDA FUN
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THIS IS WHAT WE'LL DO
I FOUND THAT WE DID WE COULD HAVE USED ANOTHER FIVE OR TEN MINUTES
SOMETIMES IN THE MEETINGS
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK THE LAST TIME WE HAD A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT QUITE ENOUGH
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE WE WE COULDN'T ANSWER EVERY SINGLE QUESTION
UM BUT
MM
IT WAS INTERESTING WHAT CAME OUT LIKE LATER LIKE AS I WAS DOING THE WHEN I WAS DOING THE BREAKDOWN ON THE AGENDA THAT THEY GAVE ME UM
THAT MORE POINTS CAME OUT FROM YOUR PRESENTATION EVEN
UM
I'M A LITTLE I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DIDN'T DO A UM SOMETHING FOR LOSING THE REMOTE BECAUSE THAT WAS KIND OF A BIG POINT
ABOUT YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
CONSIDERED THE RE YEAH
WELL IT'S INTERESTING THAT THEY
MM-HMM YEAH
IT WAS INTERESTING THOUGH THAT THEY PUT THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE FRUSTRATION WITH LOSING THEIR REMOTE AND YET THEY DIDN'T PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION TO UM WE WEREN'T PROVIDED WITH INFORMATION TO DISCUSS THAT
I KNOW THAT LIKE PEOPLE PEOPLE HAVE LIKE THINGS THEY CAN PUT ON THEIR KEYS THAT YOU PRESS IT AND IT'LL BEEP
BUT I BUT I'M SURE THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THAT
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT
MM
HMM
MM-HMM
MM
IT D YEAH IT DEPENDS ON HOW ORGANISED YOU ARE PERSONALLY BUT
MM-HMM
OH
CAN'T GET IN
YEP
WE SHOULD MAKE ONE THAT WALKS BY ITSELF
OR OR LIKE SOME CRAZY LIKE ELECTRO MAGNET THAT YOU PUSH IT AND IT'LL GO ZOOM TO THE T. V. AND STICK THERE
WELL BUT IF YOU COULD ATTACH THEM TO THE T. V. THEN YOU CAN
MM
OKAY
SORRY I'M JUST UM TRYING TO UPDATE MY MINUTES
I DECIDED TO YOU KNOW HOW I SENT YOU THE EMAIL SAYING THAT POWERPOINT MINUTES WILL BE COMPLIMENTARY RATHER THAN LIKE REPEATING THEM
JUST GONNA MAKE I'M MAKING FULL MINUTES SO THAT IT'LL INCLUDE ALL OF THE AGENDA AND ALL THAT
'CAUSE THAT SEEMS A LITTLE MORE USEFUL
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE LIKE INFORMATION TO SLOTH THROUGH EITHER SO
MOST OF IT MM-HMM
I ADDED SLIDES UM I ADDED A COUPLE SLIDES EACH TIME BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT
MM
WELL THE THING WAS THEY WOULD PROVIDE Y AN AGENDA WITH S LIKE SEVERAL POINTS BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE A SLIDE FOR EACH POINT
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I REMEMBER THAT I NEED TO GO OTHER THAT POINT
I KNOW PERSONALLY WHEN I DO POWERPOINT THAT'S WHAT I DO AND SO I HAD IT ONCE
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST LIKE THE TITLE OF IT LIKE THE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND I WOULD DO YOUR THREE
THE SLOGAN ON IT
NO NO NO
I THINK WE JUST NEED THE UM THE R. R. YEAH
YEAH I WAS JUST KINDA GOING BY THE WEB PAGE 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME ANY CLEAR LIKE YELLOW GREY OR
I DON'T REALLY LIKE YELLOW IN GENERAL
BUT IT
WASN'T IT INTERESTING THAT UM I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT OUR MARKET MARKETING UM EXPERT DID NOT AGREE WITH THE MARKETING UM
THE MARKETING CHOICES YOU KNOW LIKE THAT WAS A BIT OF A CONFLICT
PEOPLE ARE STUPID
MAYBE LIKE I DON'T KNOW
THAT COULD ALWAYS BE
OH
I'M CLAIMING IT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHT WELL WE MADE THREE DIFFERENT PROTOTYPES AND I GUESS WE'LL START WITH WITH THIS ONE
UM WE HAVE OUR COLOURS NOT ARE NOT FIXED BUT THIS IS THE GENERAL SHAPE
UM IT'S YOU HOLD IT SORT OF EITHER LIKE LIKE THIS IN YOUR LEFT HAND OR YOU SWITCH IT OVER AND UH IT'S EASILY ADAPTABLE TO EITHER HAND
YOU CAN PUSH THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB LIKE A MOBILE PHONE OR YOU CAN PUSH THEM WITH YOUR
INDEX FINGER OF YOUR OTHER HAND OR EVEN I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY YOU CAN HOLD IT LIKE THIS AND PRESS IT WITH YOUR SAME INDEX FINGER
UH WE HAVE THE ON OFF BUTTON AT THE TIP VERY VISIBLE VERY BIG
WE HAVE OUR UP AND DOWN BUTTONS WHICH ARE ALSO GONNA BE OUR CHANNEL SELECTORS AND WE HAVE OUR LITTLE MENU BUTTON HERE
IF YOU PUSH IF YOU'RE JUST PUSHING THESE NORMALLY THEY'RE THE MENU BUTTONS IF UH THE VOLUME BUTTONS RATHER
IF YOU PRESS SELECT ONCE THEY BECOME CHANNEL CHANGING BUTTONS
IF WE PRESS SELECT THREE TIMES
THE MENU WITH THE OTHER FEATURES AND PRO POSSIBLY ALSO WITH YOUR T. V. CHANNEL CHOICES SHOWS UP AND YOU HAVE YOUR FIVE PRESETS DOWN HERE
UM IF PEOPLE WANNA GRAB HOLD OF THAT SEE HOW IT FEELS IN YOUR HAND
THAT'S OUR NUMBER ONE PROTOTYPE
UM DO YOU WANNA PRESENT THE POTATO OR SHALL I PRESENT THE MARTIAN
THAT'S THE RHOMBUS YEP
IF YOU PRESSED AND HELD IT MAYBE
YEAH
ON OFF THAT'S A POSSIBILITY YEAH
AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE UM THE MARTIAN OR THE PEAR EITHER WAY
UM IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CREATIVE FEEL
UH YOU HAVE THE ON OFF TOGGLE STEM ON THE TOP
WE HAVE THE FIVE PRESET SEEDS
AND THEN YOU HAVE ON THE SIDES TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE THREE DIMENSIONAL
YOU HAVE YOUR CHANNEL CHANGING VOLUME CHANGING BUTTONS AND YOUR MENU BUTTON RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE
SO THAT'S FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AS WELL PLUS IT'S AN INTERESTING TALKING POINT TO HAVE STANDING UP
WE FIGURED IT COULD STAND UP LIKE THIS ON YOUR TABLE IF YOU WANTED IT TO IF I MADE THE BOT THE BOTTOM FLAT
UH THE MENU SELECT BUTTON
WE WERE WE WERE THINKING THAT
NORMALLY WE'D GO FOR FRUITY COLOURS BUT MAYBE WE'RE ALSO THINKING THAT YOUR SORT OF MIDDLE AGED MAN FOR AN EXAMPLE CUSTOMER
MIGHT NOT WANT A FRUITY COLOURED REMOTE SO M MAYBE WE'D HAVE ONE VERSION THAT'S A BIT TONED DOWN MAYBE WITH WITH LESS CONTRASTS ON IT
YEAH SOMETHING STILL A LITTLE BRIGHT TO MAKE IT HARD TO LOSE BUT
YEAH
RIGHT
WELL WE WERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE GOT THAT EMAIL AND WE THINK THAT EACH OF THESE ARE SO DISTINCTIVE
THAT IT IT'S NOT JUST LIKE ANOTHER PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY AROUND YOUR HOUSE
IT'S GONNA BE SOMEWHERE THAT IT CAN BE SEEN
SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT THINKING THAT IT'S GONNA BE AS CRITICAL TO HAVE THE LOSS
I THINK
YEAH
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD AND THE CHIP
TO MAKE IT MAKE A NOISE OR SOMETHING BUT IT WOULD TAKE A LOT MORE DEVELOPMENT THAN WE HAVE THIS AFTERNOON
SO D DO PEOPLE HAVE A PREFERENCE AS FAR AS FEEL AND FUNCTIONALITY
UM
MM YEAH THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD
HERE STICK IT ON
SO WHERE
RIGHT
OKAY
OOH
HEY
NO I KINDA LIKE IT
THAT'S HARD TO MISS
LIKE
YEAH
INTERESTING
OKAY IS THAT WHERE PEOPLE ARE LEANING THEN THE POTATO
I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE I MEAN THAT'S REALLY GOTTEN THE SIMPLICITY OF THE BUTTONS DOWN THAT ONE
HMM
WELL THAT ON THE IPOD FOR EXAMPLE YOU JUST EVERY TIME YOU WANNA GO BACK YOU HIT THE MENU BUTTON AGAIN AND IT BRINGS YOU BACK ONE LEVEL
GOOD POINT
MAYBE YEAH MAYBE IT CAN BE ONE OF THOSE IF YOU PRESS DOWN AND HOLD
FOR TWO SECONDS THEN IT BRINGS YOU BACK ONE LEVEL OR SOMETHING
THE POTATO
ARE WE LEANING TOWARDS THE POTATO
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
UM I DUNNO IF IT'S IT'S CREATIVE
I DUNNO IF FANCY IS THE WORD I WOULD USE
I DUNNO IF ANY OF THEM ARE FANCY IN I'D SAY TWO BECAUSE C UNIQUE
YEAH ONE
IN THE BATTERY THAT'S IT
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD NOTICE THAT THOUGH
YEAH
I I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S
YEAH LIKE FANCY VERSUS CREATIVE IT'S IT'S
DIFFERENT
BUT DOES THAT EQUAL INNOVATIVE
I DUNNO
I'LL GIVE IT A THREE
OKAY
UM I'LL GIVE IT A ONE
PRETTY HARD TO MESS UP
YEAH
OOH THAT YOU COULDN'T IT'D BE HARDER TO BREAK HARDER TO LOSE
MM
IT IT MIGHT BE 'CAUSE THAT'S OUR CORPORATE COLOUR ISN'T IT
WE MIGHT WANNA KEEP IT YELLOW
YEAH
IF WE HAD A YELLOW
SURE
SO IT WAS INSPIRED BY THE POTATO SO I THINK IT'S PRETTY FRUITY
OH MANGO THAT THAT
THAT'S A MUCH MORE TRENDY THAN A POTATO ONE
YEAH ME TOO
YEAH
YEAH
I'LL I'LL SAY TWO AS WELL
BECAUSE OLDER PEOPLE THAT AREN'T USED TO LIKE TEXTING WITH THE THUMB MIGHT FIND IT A BIT AT FIRST BUT
THE MENU SYSTEM AND THE THE FACT THAT MULTIPLE BUTTONS ARE USED FOR DIFFERENT THINGS MIGHT BE A BIT CONFUSING
BUT I THINK IF IT'S ONE IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IT MIGHT TAKE YOU FIVE MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT BUT YOU'LL HAVE IT AFTERWARDS
SO I'D I THINK I'D GIVE IT A TWO I GUESS
OH GOOD POINT
UM I'D SAY I'D GIVE IT UH A THREE I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON HOW TIDY YOU ARE NORMALLY
SIMPLE TO USE OR SIMPLE IN DESIGN
DO YOU KNOW
RIGHT
I'M GIVE IT A THREE I GUESS
I DUNNO
I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE AS FASHIONABLE AS MY ROBOT REMOTE
OR ALIEN OR WHATEVER HE WAS
UM TWO
YEAH
YEAH I'LL SAY TWO
SHALL WE UH
WELL I THINK ALL OF THEM SHOULD HAVE AN R. R.
OH MY
UH WE'RE N USING KINETIC YEAH
YEAH
SINGLE
SIMPLE SIMPLE RATHER
UH UH UH DOUBLE CURVED
YEAH I NEVER DID GET A PICTURE OF THOSE SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW
OUR CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENTS OOPS WE JUST SKIPPED BY THEM
NO WE WE THE PLASTIC IS THE PLASTIC FOR THE INSIDE IS ASSUMED
THE SUPPLEMENT IS
OH I GUESS IT WAS RUBBER RATHER THAN LATEX
YEAH
UH WELL
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SE THE BASIC COLOUR IS THOUGH
WELL ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ON EACH COLOUR COMBINATION OR ARE WE YOU KNOW WE'LL LIKE WE'LL HAVE YELLOW AND BLACK
IS THAT TWO SPECIAL COLOURS
OR OR IS WHITE AND BLACK THEN TWO MORE OR
UH
I GUESS IT'S THREE THREE THREE
ALRIGHT
YEAH
SIX WITH THE POWER
YEAH
NO
OH WE'LL DO WE WA
ARE THE BUTTONS IN SPECIAL COLOUR SPECIAL F
I DIDN'T GET INFORMATION ON
WELL DOES IT BUT IF WE'RE MAKING MULTIPLE VARIETIES OF THIS IS WHERE I'M GETTING CONFUSED
PER UNIT OKAY OKAY
ALRIGHT AND EACH BUTTON S
YEAH OKAY
NO I THINK THEY'RE FINE
MATERIAL WE WANT THEM RUBBER AS WELL PROBABLY YEAH
NO I DON'T THINK SO
I THINK THEY'RE IF THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE RUBBER THEN IT THAT'S WHAT IT MATTERS
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OH OH
OKAY LET'S HAVE OUR BUTTONS ALL BE ONE COLOUR
ALRIGHT
UH
WE HAVE NO IDEA
I DUNNO I DIDN'T GET ANY PICTURES
IT'S SINGLE CURVED
WHY NOT
YEAH
THAT IS IMPORTANT
HOW DID IT GET MORE EXPENSIVE WHAT DID YOU JUST CHANGE
IT WAS IT WAS THIRTEEN AND NOW IT'S FIFTEEN
TWELVE POINT FIVE
HEY HEY
WE'RE ALL SET THEN
ISH
ALRIGHT
YES
WELL
I FELT VERY CREATIVE
I ENJOYED MAKING THE PROTOTYPES
YEAH
I THINK WE COULD'VE DONE EVEN BETTER WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION LIKE WHAT'S A SINGLE CURVED CASE HOW MANY COLOURS WHAT DO COLOURS COUNT
THINGS BUT GIVEN GIVEN WHAT WE HAD I THINK THAT WE DID WE DID REALLY WELL
UM I THINK WE WORKED TOGETHER PRETTY WELL
YEAH
BUT THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THEY REALLY MY CREATIVITY SO
DO YOU THINK WE COULD
YEAH
YEAH
CAN WE MARKET THIS AS THE MANGO REMOTE
SHOULD WE HAVE THAT SOMEWHERE ON THE PACKAGING
I HAVE A LITTLE R. R.
YES
HOPEFULLY NOT WITH JUST MY FINGERNAIL AT SOME POINT BUT UM IT'S QUITE A USEFUL LITTLE GADGET
ALL THANKS TO IAIN FOR THE DESIGN OF THAT ONE
MM
WHAT DID WE FIND FOR NEW IDEAS
PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY BASE THEIR REMOTES ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
I I AM REALLY INTO THE IDEA OF KINETIC BATTERIES NOW AFTER READING ABOUT THEM
THAT WAS
I I KNEW YOU CAN GET WATCHES THAT HAD THEM LIKE REALLY QUITE EXPENSIVE WATCHES THAT JUST NEVER NEED A BATTERY 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS MOVING YOUR WRIST
BUT IN OTHER THINGS I THINK IT'D BE REALLY GOOD
YES
YEAH
IT STARTED BECAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE IT AS ST AS A STEM AND THEN ALRIGHT SO
IS IT STARTED AS A PEAR BUT THEN IT STARTED LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE A MARTIAN WHEN I PUT THE
TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER
WOW MAYBE I SHOULD MARKET IT TO SOME REMOTE CONTROL COMPANY NOW
SO ARE ARE POOR LITTLE THING
OH
IT'S REALLY FUNNY THAT YOU GOT SPAM IN YOUR WORK EMAILS
LET'S SEE WHAT DID I GET THROUGH THE CORPORATE WEBSITE
IT'S JUST INSPIRATION ABOUT CIRCUIT BOARDS
YEAH THAT IS PRETTY NEAT
YEAH MY INSPIRATION FROM FROM LAST TIME IS THE IN INTERIOR OF A REMOTE CONTROL BEING TAKEN APART BIT BY BIT TALKING ABOUT CIRCUIT BOARDS
I LEARNED A LOT ACTUALLY
I COULD PROBABLY TAKE APART A REMOTE CONTROL NOW IF I REALLY NEEDED TO
NOW I HAVE ALL ABOUT CIRCUITS AND CHIPS AND TRANSPONDERS AND I WROTE IT ALL DOWN BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE RELEVANT
LIKE ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE INSIDE OF A REMOTE CONTROL BUT THEN THEY'RE LIKE
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED THIS YOU JUST NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE CASE
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THOUGH
YEAH
THAT WAS REALLY NEAT HOW I GOT EMAILS AND
NO
I YEAH
IF I'D GOTTEN PICTURES OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CASE THE DIFFERENT LOOKS OF THE CASE I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY DRAWN THEM UP BUT
YEAH WE COULD'VE PUT OUR BRAINSTORMING STUFF UP THERE RATHER THAN JUST TALKING ABOUT IT BUT WITH ONLY FOUR PEOPLE IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE
I THINK IF YOU HAD A LARGER GROUP
YEAH
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GONNA BE WORKING IN DIFFERENT PLACES
WE IF WE WERE ALL GONNA STAY IN HERE ALL THE TIME THEN HAVING THE NOTES UP ON THE WHITEBOARD WOULD'VE BEEN ALRIGHT
BUT EVERYONE NEEDS THEIR OWN LIKE SPECIFIC NOTES I GUESS
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT WAS A BIT OF BOTH REALLY WE JUST KIND OF STARTED OUT BY EACH TAKING A COLOUR OF CLAY AND
JUST FOOLING AROUND WITH IT AND I CAME UP WITH THAT RHOMBUS SHAPE AND HE CAME UP WITH THE SORT OF POTATOEY
MANGOEY SHAPE AND THEN JUST WENT FROM THERE REALLY
IT WAS FUN
SO WELL DONE WITH THE MANAGEMENT I FELT WELL MANAGED
THAT HAPPENED TO ME ALL THE TIME THOUGH
YEAH I WAS QUITE WORRIED AT THE END OF THE LAST MEETING THAT WE WEREN'T GETTING WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE FIRM DECISIONS
BUT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT REGARDLESS SO
I'M NOT USUALLY A VERY DECISIVE PERSON SO IT HELPED TO HAVE PEOPLE SAY THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE IN FIVE MINUTES
ESPECIALLY LAST TIME YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
AND I I FELT THE FIRST TWO MEETINGS THAT I WAS COMING IN WITH NO INFORMATION AND NOT SORT OF
MADE ME REALLY LIKE OOH I DON'T KNOW THROWING TOGETHER POWERPOINT OUT OF NO NO INFORMATION AND THEN LAST TIME IT WAS LIKE THE OPPOSITE
I HAD SO MUCH INFORMATION AND SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT
YEAH
MM
YEAH
THAT WAS SOMETHING LIKE IN ORDER TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE WOULD'VE HAD TO HAVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CIRCUIT BOARDS AND THINGS LIKE
YEAH
I THINK WE WERE
YEAH
I THINK WE WERE JUST GETTING OVERENTHUSIASTIC WITH THE TASK
I THINK WE REALLY GOT INTO IT I MEAN I GOT INTO IT AS THE DAY WENT ON AND I GOT REALLY LIKE
OOH I'M DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL I DUNNO IF THAT'S JUST ME BUT
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE LIKE INFOMERCIAL REMOTES THAT HAVE THINGS
SO YOU WON'T LOSE THEM
I DUNNO
I MEAN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT AND LIKE I IN MY HOUSEHOLD AT LEAST
THERE'S ONLY ABOUT TWO PLACES THAT THE REMOTE IS EVER 'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE T. V. AND
THERE'S ONLY LIKE THREE CHAIRS
YEAH
YEAH OR LIKE I GUESS WHAT THE SETUP OF THE HOUSE IS TOO
BUT I MEAN
I AM NOTORIOUS FOR LOSING MY KEYS I JUST I GUESS I'VE JUST NEVER LOST THE REMOTE
I PUT MY KEYS IN THE REFRIGERATOR THE OTHER NIGHT AND COULDN'T FIND THEM
'CAUSE I WAS PUTTING GROCERIES AWAY
YOU YOU'RE TAKING STUFF FROM A BAG AND PUTTING THEM IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND THEN GO BACK TO MY ROOM
CAN'T GET IN LOOK ALL AROUND THE KITCHEN
DEFINITELY IN THE VEGETABLE DRAWER
SO
MM
BUT I GUESS IT'S 'CAUSE WE DON'T CARRY REMOTES AROUND THAT MUCH
YEAH
MAYBE WITH OUR LITTLE ROBOT ONE WE COULD'VE HAD HIM HAVE A ROBOT
ALIEN PEAR WHATEVER HE IS HAVE A LITTLE VOICE LIKE I AM LOCATED
OH A G. P. S. SYSTEM INTERNAL G. P. S.
ALTHOUGH IF IT'S SITTING STILL FOR TOO LONG
YES I
OR LITTLE
OR JUST JUST A WHEEL YOU KNOW
JUST IF YOU LIKE YOU'D HAVE A REMOTE FOR YOUR REMOTE THAT'LL
ZOOM
YEAH
HMM
ALL KINDS OF POSSIBILITIES
YEAH
OH
WOW
'CAUSE YOU'VE HAD LIKE THE MOST TYPING AND ORGANISING TO DO
YEAH I GUESS
HOW MUCH OF YOUR POWERPOINT WAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU EVERY MEETING
OH
OKAY
YEAH I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ADDING SLIDES
'CAUSE I WOULD JUST GET SLIDES WITH TITLES ON THEM AND FILL THEM ALL IN W DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ADDING MORE
AH YEAH
RIGHT
NO NO DEFINITELY NOT
WE
NO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO I THINK THE R. AND R. ESPECIALLY IF THE YELLOW AND BLACK ONE
OR YELLOW AND BLUE
LEMME GO TO THE WEB PAGE
FINISH MEETING NOW
YEAH
I GUESS IT I IT SORT OF A GREY ISN'T IT
YELLOW AND GREY BUT THEN THE SLOGAN'S IN BLUE
YEAH
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT COLOUR CLAY ANYWAY
WELL WE'RE NOT SADLY GOING TO ACTUALLY BE PRODUCING THIS SO
POTATO MANGO SHAPED REMOTES
I CAN'T BELIEVE A WHOLE DAY IS GONE
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S BEEN THAT LONG
GET SUCKED IN
MM I HAVEN'T GOTTEN QUESTIONNAIRE EIGHT YET
RIGHT DO YOU WANNA START
OKAY UM
WHAT
WE CALL THAT ONE THE RHOMBUS UH THE RHOMBUS
UM THIS ONE IS KNOWN AS THE POTATO UH IT'S
IT'S A HOW CAN I PRESENT IT
IT'S AN ERGONOMIC SHAPE SO IT IT FITS IN YOUR HAND NICELY
UM
IT'S DESIGNED TO BE USED EITHER IN YOUR LEFT HAND OR OR IN YOUR RIGHT HAND
UM I'VE GONE HERE JUST FOR JUST FOR FOUR BUTTONS ON THIS ONE
UM
THE TWO BLUE BUTTONS HERE ARE FOR ADJUSTING THE VOLUME
SO YOU'VE GOT VOLUME UP AND VOLUME DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE HERE
UM THE RED ONES ARE FOR UH CHANGING CHANNELS CHANNEL UP AND CHANNEL DOWN AND THAT'S UM MOVES BETWEEN YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS THAT YOU'VE SELECTED
UH THIS MIDDLE BUTTON HERE BRINGS UP THE ON SCREEN MENU AND WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN THE ON SCREEN MENU YOU USE THE OTHER FOUR BUTTONS TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE MENU SYSTEM AND THE MIDDLE BUTTON UH TO SELECT
AND THAT'S BASICALLY IT THAT'S THE POTATO
UH THAT WOULD BE ONE OF YOUR CHANNELS BASICALLY SO LIKE CHANNEL ZERO WOULD BE T TO SWITCH SWITCH THE MACHINE OFF YEAH
UM NOT REALLY IT WOULD MAKE IT HARD TO TURN THE MACHINE OFF TO TURN YOUR T. V. OFF
YEAH YEAH THAT THAT'D BE ONE WAY OF DOING IT YEAH
THAT'D WORK YEAH
LET'S PASS
SO THAT'S
SO THAT'S OUR THREE PROTOTYPES
UM BASICALLY IN TERMS OF MAKING DECISIONS
WHAT WE'D NEED TO DO IS FIRST OF ALL DECIDE ON A FORM UH WHICH OF THE THREE DIFFERENT SHAPES WE WANT
THEN DECIDE WHAT KIND OF BUTTON LAYOUT WE WANT HOW MANY BUTTONS
AND THEN TO CHOOSE WHAT COLOURS WE WANT TO MAKE THE BUTTONS AND IF WE WANNA PUT ANY TEXT ON THE DEVICE
LIKE LABEL ON THE BUTTONS OR PUT A BRAND NAME OR OR A LOGO ON IT OR WHATEVER
WOULD
YEAH
BUT WE DON'T WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE A KIDS' TOY
YEAH
I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TECHNOLOGICALLY
BECAUSE IF YOUR IF YOUR REMOTE'S LOST IT'S PROBABLY UNDER THE SETTEE AND IN THAT CASE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T SEND AN INFRARED SING SIGNAL TO IT TO FIND IT
S SO IT'S
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW IT WOULD WORK AND THEN I WONDER IF IT'S IF IT'S MORE JUST A GIMMICK THEN ANYTHING ELSE
UH I MEAN HO HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU REALLY SERIOUSLY LOSE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND WOULD WOULD A DEVICE LIKE THAT ACTUALLY HELP YOU TO FIND IT
YEAH IT'S POSSIBLE YEAH YEAH
PUT AN EXTRA THE BUTTON ON
COOL
IT MAKES LOOK MORE FRUITY AS WELL
IT'S LIKE A DEFORMED FOOT I DUNNO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THIS IS IT'S THE UP AND DOWN BUTTONS ARE USED FOR SCROLLING UP AND DOWN FOR A LIST OF CHOICES
YOU FIND THE CHOICE THAT YOU WANT AND YOU PRESS UH YOU PRESS THE RIGHT BUTTON UH
YEAH
YEAH SO THEY'RE USED FOR GOING INTO AND OUT OF YOUR SUBMENUS YEAH
POTATO
I'LL GO FOR TWO
I THINK IT'S IT'S FUNCTIONAL IT'S ALSO PRETTY BASIC SO I'LL GIVE IT A TWO
I'D SAY IT'S TECHNOLOGICALLY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UNIQUE I MEAN IT'S IT'S JUST IT IS JUST PUSHBUTTONS UM SO I I'D GIVE IT A FOUR
I'LL SAY ONE
I WONDER IF IT BOUNCES WHEN YOU DROP IT
YEAH
YEAH I'D I'D GIVE IT A ONE
UH UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MANGOEY IS BETTER YEAH
I LIKE MANGOES
UH TWO
UH ONE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH I'LL I'LL SAY TWO
I THINK IT IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE HARDER THEN MOST REMOTES TO LEARN
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO USE THE MENU SYSTEM AND YOU HAVE TO TELL IT WHAT YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS ARE AND THAT COULD TAKE A BIT OF LEARNING AT FIRST
BUT
ONCE YOU'VE YEAH ONCE YOU'D LEARNED HOW TO USE IT I THINK IT IS A LOT EASIER
SO I'D I'D GIVE IT A FOUR
YEAH
YEAH
UM I'LL GIVE IT A FIVE 'CAUSE I IT WOULD BE EASY TO LOSE SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
I'LL GIVE IT A TWO
THREE
GUESS IT'S DOUBLE CURVED
IT IS PRETTY CURVY
SPECIAL COLOURS ISN'T IT
WE'VE GOT FIVE
OH SIX
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT WAS OUR TARGET PRICE AGAIN
TWELVE POINT FIVE
SO WE'RE JUST JUST ABOUT THERE
YEAH
I THINK WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED ALMOST ALL OF THE DESIGN GOALS THAT WE'VE SET AND WE'VE COME UP WITH A FINISHED PROJECT AND WE JUST ABOUT GOT COST
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
THAT'S COOL
LET'S ALL LET'S ALL GO FOR THE YELLOW
BREAK THE STEM OFF
THAT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN
MM
YEAH
I THINK
YEAH
WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T USE THE WHITEBOARD THAT MUCH
YEAH
UH WE WE WORKED TOGETHER UM BUT WE WERE MAKING LIKE WE SORT OF MADE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND THEN DISCUSSED HOW THE HOW THE BUTTONS MIGHT WORK
UM AND HOW WE COULD LIKE IMPROVE ON THE ON THE DESIGN
I THINK WE DID WELL IN FIRST OF ALL GIVING OUR MEETINGS THE TIME AND SECOND WE ACTUALLY
WE WE DID A GOOD JOB OF MAKING FIRM DECISIONS AT THE ENDS OF THE MEETINGS
AND I
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES IS THAT YOU TEND TO SORT OF HAVE MEETINGS AND THEN PEOPLE SORTA DRIFT AWAY WITHOUT ANYTHING ACTUALLY REALLY BEING DECIDED
BUT I THINK HERE WE GOT WE GOT CLEAR AND AND DECISIVE DECISIVE POINTS AT THE END OF THE MEETINGS
SO THAT WE WE KNEW WHERE TO GO ON FROM THERE
YEAH
YEAH FOR SOME OF THE MEETINGS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I COULD
COULD THE MIDDLE BUTTON OF THE ON SCREEN MENU FUNCTION AS A POWER BUTTON
IF YOU LIKE HELD IT DOWN THAT WOULD BE ON OFF
SORRY WHAT'S THE YELLOW ONE IN THE MIDDLE I FORGOT
BUT IF IT'S LIKE UNDER COVERS OR LIKE IN A COUCH YOU STILL CAN'T SEE IT
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SIMIL OR IT'S SORT OF WHAT ALREADY EXISTS SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING SORT OF LIKE NEW AND FUN
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE INIT I'M INITIALLY DRAWN TO JUST 'CAUSE IT'S LIKE COMFORTABLE AND LIKE NOT DIFFERENT
I SORT OF LIKE THIS ONE LIKE I I DON'T KNOW WHY IT JUST IT'S LIKE SMALL BUT STILL SORT OF LIKE CUTE LOOKING I DUNNO
BUT I ALSO LIKE THE B THE SIDE BUTTONS ON THAT ONE LIKE I THINK THAT'S KIND OF NEAT
BUT I DUNNO HOW MUCH ANY OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FASHIONABLE SORT OF COOL LOOKING THING THAT WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS ON
AH THERE WE GO
WELL DO WE W LIKE I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ONE THAT WE DO IT FOR
THAT WAS I WAS A LITTLE VAGUE ON WHAT EXACTLY I'M SUPPOSED TO DO BUT LET ME I HAVE TO LIKE WRITE SOMETHING ON THE WHITEBOARD SO
NO I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE LIKE A POWERPOINTY THING 'CAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE REDUNDANT
I DUNNO
OKAY SO WHICH ONE ARE WE SORT OF ROUGHLY LOOKING AT TO ADDRESS WHETHER OR NOT IT MEETS OUR S UM NECESSITIES THE YELLOWY ONE IS THAT
OKAY WELL WE CAN OBVIOUSLY CHANGE IT AFTER WE GO THROUGH EACH DIFFERENT ONE
SO BASICALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT REMOTE ACTUALLY DOES CONFORM TO THE THINGS THAT WE SAID IT WAS GOING TO
SO WHAT WE SORT OF WANNA DO IS THAT WE EACH NEED TO SEPARATELY
RANK EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS AND THEN I'LL TABULATE AN AVERAGE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES MEET THAT
SO WE'LL JUST GO THROUGH THEM ONE AT A TIME AND WE'LL JUST GO AROUND AND EACH OF YOU CAN TELL ME ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN WITH ONE BEING REALLY EXTREMELY TRUE
AND SEVEN BEING NOT TRUE AT ALL OR FALSE IF THE REMOTE THAT WE'VE CREATED CONFORMS TO THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA
SO WE CAN DO THIS ONE FIRST
FIRST WE WANNA KNOW IF IT MEETS THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL UM OBJECTIVE
SO LIKE IN MY OPINION THE FOR NOW AT LEAST THE YELLOW ONE IS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE SO I'M GONNA SAY IT'S LIKE A THREE
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION
WHAT DOES EACH OF YOU
OKAY WELL GIVE IT A NUMBER SORRY
OKAY
AND TWO AWESOME
ALRIGHT AND SAME SORT OF SCALE FOR FUNCTIONALITY IS IT FUNCTIONAL
I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY FUNCTIONAL I'M GONNA GIVE IT A ONE
ONE
OKAY
OKAY
WELL THERE'S SOME OTHER ONES I WILL ADDRESS THAT YEAH
AWESOME OKAY
UM WE WANNA KNOW NEXT IF IT'S TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
YEAH SHE SAID IT WAS ONE
UM IS IT TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
MM
NOT REALLY I MEAN NOT SO MUCH 'CAUSE WE WE DON'T HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE DON'T HAVE FANCY CHIP
OTHER THAN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE I DUNNO IF IT'S REALLY
I KINETIC BATTERY IS A BIG ONE SO
MM
BUT IT BUT WE KNOW IT'S THERE
AND IF IT'S MADE OF LIKE LATEX THAT WHOLE IDEA THAT'S PRETTY COOL
I'LL GIVE IT A THREE
'CAUSE IT WE COULD'VE PICKED A LOT OF FEATURES THAT WOULD'VE MADE IT REALLY
ALRIGHT
EVERYONE ELSE
MM 'KAY
NEXT IS IT EASY TO USE
JUST SO YOU KNOW EASY TO LEARN WILL BE SEPARATE SO DON'T OVERLAP THEM
I THINK IT'S REALLY EASY TO USE
I'LL GIVE IT A TWO
ALRIGHT
UM WE NEXT WANNA SEE IF IT HAS A SPONGY QUALITY AND IF INDEED IT'S MADE OF LATEX OR RUBBER I IT'S SPONGY ALL THE WAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
IAIN WHAT DO YOU GIVE IT
ALRIGHT AND THE NEXT IS DOES IT INTEGRATE SOME NOTION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
WELL IS IT GONNA BE YELLOW
YEAH BUT IF YOU HAD LIKE A SILVERY KIND OF WHITE OR SOMETHING
OH YEAH
ALRIGHT SO I THINK IT IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
I OKAY I'M GIVING IT A ONE THE MANGO PUT ME OVER
WHAT ARE WHAT'S EVERYONE'S NUMBERS
ALRIGHT UM AND DOES THE DESIGN MATCH THE APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR
REMEMBER EARLIER WE DISCUSSED THAT PEOPLE DON'T USE A LOT OF BUTTONS THAT THEY USE THE CHANNEL FLIPPING AND THE VOLUME THE MOST
I THINK WE REALLY TOOK THAT INTO ACCOUNT A LOT SO I'M GONNA GIVE IT A ONE
DID YOU SAY ONE ROSE
OKAY UM ALSO WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT R. S. I. AND WANTING TO PREVENT UM ANY SORT OF LIKE CARPAL TUNNELY KIND OF THING
DO WE THINK THAT THE LATEX SORT OF GRIP APPROPRIATELY TAKES THAT INTO ACCOUNT
I THINK I'LL GIVE IT A TWO 'CAUSE I ALMOST FEEL LIKE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO SOMETHING IS GONNA HAPPEN
UM UM WORTH THE RISK I THINK
'KAY
ALRIGHT AWESOME
AND THE EASE OF LEARNING IT
I KNOW YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT THAT I DUNNO
IT SORT OF REMINDS ME OF THE IPOD
I JUST GOT MINE I STILL HAVEN'T READ THE INSTRUCTION BOOK AND I'M DOING OKAY SO AND I'M NOT GOOD AT LEARNING TECHNOLOGY
SO I'LL GIVE IT A TWO
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT UM ALSO EARLIER WE HAD SOMETHING ABOUT LOSING IT AND SO NOW WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THAT AT ALL SO
OKAY SO IN TERMS OF NOT LOSING IT DO YOU THINK THAT ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN HOW EASY OR HARD IS IT TO LOSE
I'M GONNA I'M GONNA GIVE IT A FOUR 'CAUSE I THINK THAT YOU CAN STILL IF IT'S IN BETWEEN SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE IT
YOU'RE KIND OF NOT GONNA FIND IT BUT ANYWHERE ELSE IT'S GONNA STAND OUT
ALRIGHT WE ALSO SAID SIMPLICITY HOW W HOW WELL DOES IT ADDRESS JUST BEING SIMPLE
I THINK OVERALL 'CAUSE WE HAD SAID BEFORE OUR TWO MAIN THINGS WERE SIMPLICITY AND FASHION SO THOSE ARE THE NEXT TWO THINGS WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT
SEPARATE FROM FANCY LIKE THAT SORT OF THING
UM IT LIKE WANTS TO BE SIMPLE BUT IT'S NOT LIKE TOTALLY TOTALLY SIMPLE SO I'M GONNA GIVE IT A TWO
ALRIGHT AND FASHIONABLE
IT'S HOT I MEAN IT'S A MANGO COME ON
I MEAN HOW FASHIONABLE CAN YOU MAKE A REMOTE
I THINK IT'S BRINGING TECHNOLOGY AND FASHION TOGETHER REAL REALLY WELL
YEAH THE TOGGLE ON OFF SWITCH IT'S REALLY APPEALING
NUMBER
AND DOES IT MEET OUR LIKE DEMOGRAPHIC NEED SORT OF FOR INTERNATIONAL APPEAL
THAT WHOLE THING
JUST THAT IT WOULD SE SERVE OUR AUDIENCE
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT DID ANYONE HAVE ANY OTHER FEATURES THAT THEY THINK WERE IMPORTANT THAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT
AND SO WE'RE GONNA DO THAT SO IT WILL ADDRESS IT FINE
OKAY
THAT'S ME
WHOA
SIMPLE
YEAH
WELL DON'T WE NEED PLASTIC AND
PROVIDED OKAY
IT WAS RUBBER AND SPECIAL COLOUR RIGHT
DO WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE SPECIAL COLOUR
PER
WELL BUT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE HAVING AT LEAST THREE COLOURS SO
RIGHT
WE HAVE SIX
OH NO FIVE
OH WAIT
YEAH
YEAH PER UNIT
YEAH
I LIKE IT LIKE THAT
YEAH 'CAUSE IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE OTHERWISE 'CAUSE FOR THE WHOLE MAT CASE MATERIAL IT'S ONLY ONE
IT'S I MEAN IT'S TWO TO MAKE IT RUBBER
OH WAIT SO MAYBE
MM I KIND OF LIKE THE BUTTONS
IT'S SINGLE CURVED
WE
YEAH THEY ARE
YEAH I MEAN IF I'D HAD MORE MARKET RESEARCH ON THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES MAYBE WE COULD'VE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT
I KNOW I REALLY DID THE THE WHOLE MANGO IDEA WAS GREAT
NO I MEAN
I THOUGHT THE PEN WAS A LITTLE DISTRACTING FOR ME PERSONALLY LIKE ITS HEAVINESS AND LIKE JUST BEING SO CONSCIOUS OF LIKE TURNING THE PAGES I DUNNO
THAT WAS A BIT OF A DISTRACTION
THAT WAS THE LAST ONE LIKE I CHOSE NOT TO DO A POWERPOINT 'CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT MADE SENSE TO
SO I LIKED THAT I HAD THE OPTION TO DO THAT AND JUST TO TAKE MY OWN NOTES AND THAT WHOLE SORT OF THING
THEY'RE FUNNY
I KIND OF WANT ONE
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF A GOOD PUN THAT I COULD ADD THERE
I LIKE THE R. R. THAT'S GONNA BE ETCHED IN
YEAH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXISTED
YEAH REAL REACTION
OH THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE MY SECOND CHOICE
I WOULD BREAK IT
I WOULD BREAK IT
OH THAT'S FUNNY
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A PENGUIN LIKE WITH NO EYE
I LIKE THAT IT STANDS UP
OH SAD
NOTHING WILL COME UP UNTIL AFTER OUR MEETING'S SUPPOSED TO BE OVER ITS ALL TIMED
OH
NO THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU SENT LIKE I DIDN'T REALISE THAT IT WAS A JOKE AND I WAS LIKE WHY DID SHE SEND THIS TO US
IT'S VERY IT'S VERY WORK RELEVANT 'CAUSE PEOPLE SEND SPAM A LOT
OH HERE YOU CAN YOU CAN VIEW
YOU CAN JUST SEE WHAT'S UP
YEAH IT'S IT'S REALLY DEEP
HOLD ON
TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO GET EXCITED TO LOAD
THAT THE EXCEL THING IS PRETTY COOL
HERE LIKE BASICALLY IT'S LIKE INSPIRATION BASICALLY I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO SENTENCES ON FASHION AND
THAT KIND OF THING SEE
YOU DIDN'T MISS OUT THAT MUCH
OH WOW
THIS ONE WAS COOLER
I GOT A WHOLE TABLE AND EVERYTHING
THAT'S LIKE MINE IT WAS LIKE WOULD YOU PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN OR A MULTIFUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEN IT DIDN'T HAVE LIKE ANY KIND OF TABLE LIKE AWESOME I'M GLAD THEY ASKED THAT QUESTION AND DIDN'T REPORT THE RESULT
YEAH
'CAUSE WE WEREN'T LIKE VOTING ON ANYTHING AND I THINK USUALLY LIKE WHITEBOARDS ARE GOOD
YOU KNOW LIKE CROSSING OUT IDEAS OR LIKE IF WE HAD HAD LIKE A BRAINSTORMING PERIOD
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOOD ORALLY
GET CRAZY
AND THESE MIGHT'VE MADE US MORE WILLING TO LIKE TAKE NOTES THAN TO
LIKE WRITE UP THEM HERE 'CAUSE WE ALL NEEDED THEM SEPARATELY KIND OF ON THE WHITEBOARDS IN THIS ROOM
YEAH
SORRY
WELL THE PROBLEM WAS EVEN WHEN WE JUST WERE CREATING FROM THE EXCEL FILE
THERE WASN'T LIKE A OPTION TO SELECT TO SOMEHOW HAVE IT INCLUDED SO THERE WAS NO WE COULD BE LIKE YEAH IT HAS IT INCLUDED
THERE WAS NO WAY FOR US TO HAVE
WRITTEN DOWN THAT IT WAS REALLY THERE
YEAH
THAT'S LIKE SAYING YOU'RE NEVER GONNA LOSE YOUR KEYS AND I ALWAYS DO ANYWAY
YOU'LL LOSE 'EM IN YOUR POCKET LIKE YOU JUST WILL FORGET THAT OR YOU LIKE PUT IT DOWN SOMEWHERE THAT LIKE MADE SENSE AND THEN NOT REMEMBER
THERE'S ALWAYS WAYS TO LOSE THINGS
THAT'S FUNNY
THAT'S FUNNY
I ALWAYS DO THAT LEAVING IT IN MY COAT AND THEN LIKE USING A DIFFERENT COAT
YEAH
CAN'T REALLY TAKE IT INTO THE OTHER ROOM
OH MAN
HERE YOU GO
THAT REALLY COULD GET UP AND WALK AWAY
YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SLOGAN ON IT OR CAN IT JUST BE LIKE
OKAY GOOD
'CAUSE I WAS LIKE IT COULD GO AROUND THE OUTSIDE
IS IT YELLOW AND BLUE
OH I GUESS IT IS BLACK GREY
GREY IS BETTER THAN BLACK DOESN'T LOOK SO BUMBLEBEEISH
HEY NOW I UNDERSTAND THE RANDOM LIKE NEWSCLIPPINGS
YES
I WILL I JUST FEEL LIKE IF YOU'RE REALLY DOING LIKE A A REALLY BIG MARKET EVALUATION YOU WOULDN'T JUST HAVE LIKE ONE SET OF SOURCE
IT'S KIND OF AN THEY WERE SO NOT BACKED UP IT WOULD JUST BE A SENTENCE LIKE WE DID A SURVEY THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE SAID
S MM I DUNNO
WELL WE GOT SOME GREY AND WE GOT SOME BLUE BUTTONS WE'RE GOOD
IF THEY EVER COME OUT WITH POTATO
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
YEAH
I KNOW
LIKE THAT
OKAY COOL
OKAY
RIGHT SO I'M JUST GONNA START THIS POWERPOINT REAL QUICK
YEAH POWERPOINT
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW
YEAH I KINDA LIKE THIS I'M KINDA GETTING INTO IT
RIGHT
UM
SO JUST TO KICK OFF THE MEETING BASICALLY UM SO WE'RE WORKING NOW FOR A REAL REACTION THIS IS UH SO IT RIGHT
JUST GOT AN AGENDA TO SET OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO ACCOMPLISH IN THIS PARTICULAR FIRST MEETING
UM
WE'RE GONNA JUST DO A QUICK OPENING AND WE CAN HOPEFULLY ALL GET ACQUAINTED WITH ONE ANOTHER UM THEN WE'RE GONNA START TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TOOL TRAINING
ESSENTIALLY THAT MEANS GETTING USED TO THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVEN'T TRIED OUT YET THE WHITEBOARD
UM WE'VE GOT A GENERAL PLAN FOR THE PROJECT HOW WE'RE GONNA GO ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING THIS AND THEN JUST A BIT OF DISCUSSION CLOSE UP
UM I GUESS YOU KNOW GAME OR SOMETHING UM IN REAL LIFE UM SO YEAH BASICALLY
I WANT TO I'M JUST GONNA YOU GOT OF COURSE YOU CAN DISCUSS THAT
I'M THINKING ABOUT UM UH PROPOSING THAT SINCE WE'VE GOT THIS WEIRD BLEND OF OURSELVES AND OUR ROLES THAT WE JUST DON'T ASK DON'T TELL
UM SO UM IF YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT MARKETING RIGHT SORTED UM Y IS
EXACTLY
UM I MEAN OBVI IF IF YOU GUYS IF IF AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU LIKE LOGICALLY IF SOMETHING DOESN'T LIKE IF I'M LIKE WE'RE GONNA SELL A REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S THE SIZE OF THIS PAPER BOOK YOU KNOW
UM YOU SAY LIKE WELL THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SUCH A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE OF X. OBVIOUSLY GO WITH IT
I MEAN WE'LL DISCUSS IT BUT
I'M NOT GONNA ASK DO YOU KNOW THAT OR UH YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE YEAH YEAH EXACTLY SO
'CAUSE WE'RE WHAT WE'RE SORT OF ROLE PLAYING IS Y G YEAH YOU'RE GONNA TAP INTO YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE AS WELL UM
AND THAT'S THE SAME FOR YOUR WHEN WE DO INTRODUCTIONS I MEAN UM AND YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND YOU KNOW HAVE FUN
YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU WENT TO UM
UH YOU KNOW MAYBE I YOU'RE LIKE IN MAINE YOU WENT TO U. C. S. B. BUT YOU WANNA SAY YOU WENT TO HARVARD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHY NOT YOU KNOW YOU CAN THIS IS YOU KNOW I GUESS WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN WITH IT
SO ARE YOU GUYS OKAY WITH THAT DOES THAT SEEM LOGICAL
SWEET
COOL
SO I GUESS THAT THAT WE'RE TOTALLY WE'RE MAKING A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS THRILLING UM UH BUT THE IDEA IS THAT WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING BASED ON THE WHOLE CORPORATE MODEL I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS HAD TIME TO CHECK THE IN REAL LIFE I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS UH CHECKED THE UM UH THE CORPORATE WEBSITE
UM WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SOMETHING AS FASHIONABLE AS POSSIBLE
THAT'S KIND OF THE CORPORATE STRATEGY IS WE'RE GONNA TRY TO TAKE ORDINARY STUFF THAT NOBODY REALLY THINKS ABOUT AND TRY TO MAKE IT NICE YOU KNOW LIKE JOHN LEWIS NICE OR YOU KNOW IF YOU GO TO DEBENHAM'S OR SOMETHING
SO UM BASICALLY WE ARE REINVENTING THE WHEEL BUT WE WANNA TRY TO DO IT IN A USER FRIENDLY UM SLICK SLEEK KIND OF WAY
UM WAY WE'RE GONNA GO ABOUT DOING THAT IS BASICALLY AT FIRST WE'RE GONNA START ON THE BASICS
AND THAT'S WHERE I'M GONNA NEED YOU GUYS THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNERS AND THE UM UM THE OTHER DESIGNER THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE THE I. D. AND THE U. I. D. RIGHT UM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER HEY RIGHT ON ALRIGHT GETTING INTO IT UM
TO GUIDE ME AND GUIDE US ON THIS PROJECT 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE YOU'RE G YOU GUYS ARE THE BOTTOM YOU KNOW YOU'RE LIKE NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE YOU KNOW X. AND Y. UM AT THE SAME TIME
AND THEN UM WE'LL WORK UP FROM WHAT IS NECESSARY TO MORE LIKE WHAT WOULD BE GOOD
YOU KNOW LIKE UM I I THINK YOU GUYS PROBABLY GOT THE SAME EMAILS I DID BUT THE IDEA OF UM
YES A COFFEE POT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO HOLD COFFEE BUT IT'S ALSO BETTER IF IT'S NOT LIKE REALLY CHEAP GLASS SO THAT IT IF YOU TOUCH IT YOU HURT YOUR HAND
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM AND SO WE'LL WORK UP FROM THERE AND UM THEN WE'LL MEET ON AND TALK ABOUT IT AND THEN FINALLY WE'LL INCORPORATE AS KIND OF THE LAST STAGE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU GUYS BUILD OR TELL ME TELL US WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND THEN YOU TELL US WHAT WE CAN UM HOPE FOR AND WHAT WAY TO GO TAKE THE THE THE
TAKE THE BASICS AND MAKE IT NICER AND THEN OV OBVIOUSLY UH THE U. I. D. AND THE I. D. YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN KEEP ON THE YOU KNOW SORT OF AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF HOW TO GET ABOUT MAXIMISING WHAT IS POSSIBLE
UM TO TRY T OF SYNC IT ALL UP
SO THAT'S THE DETAILED DESIGN
SO IT'S A THREE STAGE KIND OF THING
UM RIGHT SO FOR NOW JUST FOR TH THE WHITE BOARD UM
BASICALLY UH JUST TO GET USED TO IT I HAVEN'T TRIED IT YET EITHER UM I'M JUST GONNA START AND UM MM CARRY LIKE FIVE REMOTES AROUND

UM SO WHAT WE CAN MAYBE WORK ON THAT A LATER BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT ON IT THE PROFIT AIMS TO MAKE FIFTY MILLION EUROS ON IT
EUR INTERNATIONALLY
SO UM ONE OF THE THINGS I I WAS GONNA MENTION TO YOU UM YOU GUYS THE DESIGNERS IS THAT UM IT M WE PROBABLY NEED A REVER IT NEEDS TO BE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL PROBABLY
UM SO SOMETHING THAT COULD DO N. T. S. C. AS WELL AS PAL AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER FORMATS LIKE IF IT'S GONNA CONTROL D. V. D. S BUT UM YOU KNOW I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU GUYS BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I I IT IS GONNA BE AN INTERNATIONAL SOLD THING
UM BUT WE WANNA TRY TO MAKE IT FOR TWELVE FIFTY
SO WE WANNA TRY TO MAKE A HUNDRED PERCENT PROFIT ON IT IF WE CAN
UM S RIGHT SO UM JUST TO CLOSE UP I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME I'VE USED MM NEXT TIME RIGHT PROJECT MANAGER SORTED
UM
IS UH WE'LL MEET IN ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR OR SO UM AND I'D LIKE THE UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TO GET GE THINK ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
LIKE WHAT THE BASIC FUNCTION OF IT
UM U. I. D. WELL YEAH YOU RIGHT G YOUR ASSIGNMENTS ARE UP THERE AND YOU'LL ALSO GET S ASSIGNMENTS FROM IN YOUR EMAIL AS WELL MORE SPEC SPECIFICS ON WHAT DO DO
UM MM BASIC AND UM SO I NEED YOU TO TELL US WHAT UM WE WHAT THE USER'S GONNA WANT
SO ACTUALLY IN A WAY YOU GUYS C MAYBE IN OUR NEXT MEETING CHAT A BIT ABOUT WHAT THE USER'S GONNA WANT AND WHAT THE USER CAN HAVE
YOU KNOW LIKE UH SO
YEAH WELL IT IS AND WE'LL DISCUSS THE TRADE OFFS IN BETWEEN UM SO YEAH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT IN YOUR EMAIL
BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS MORE OR LESS A GOOD PLACE TO START FOR NOW UM
AND AS MORE THINGS COME UP WE'LL HAVE MEETINGS AND YOU'LL GET EMAILS AND SO FORTH
UM ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE GET STARTED
YOU MEAN TO LIKE
HMM
YEAH
WELL HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT
I MEAN I'M I'M CERTAINLY OP IT SEEMS LIKE YEAH IT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S CERTAINLY DO ABLE ISN'T IT
I MEAN UM OR IF WE CAN'T HAVE A FULL MOBILE PHONE MAYBE A REMOTE THAT HAS SOME OTHER KIND OF USEFUL FUNCTION
THE CLAPPER
NO I MEAN NO GOOD IDEA GOOD IDEA
WE'LL SEE WHAT SEE WHAT
UH-HUH Y I LIKE THAT
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE I GUESS WE WE PROBABLY HAVE SOME TIME MAYBE WE SHOULD BRAINSTORM A BIT LIKE WHAT WE WANNA DO GO BACK TO UM
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY
LET ME BRING UP SOMETHING ABOUT
OUR BASIC GOALS HERE WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH
UH PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT
TS TS TS
YEAH
NOT SO MUCH
ALL RIGHT WE'LL FIND THEM WE'RE ON OUR OWN
YEAH YEAH LET'S DO IT LET'S DO
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND TAKE NOTES ON THIS TOO 'CAUSE
YEAH I MEAN OH YEAH RIGHT
SO INITIAL IDEAS
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S SLICK ISN'T IT
I MEAN LIKE STYLIST YEAH LIKE A JUST A YEAH
RIGHT SO WE GOT FIVE MINUTES MORE TO CHAT ABOUT THIS PERFECT
UM SO WE'VE GOT THIS KIND OF AN IDEA OF A TRADE OFF BETWEEN UM UH SIZE AND FUNCTIONALITY
UM AND WE ALSO
I'M ALSO GONNA NOTE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE THIS IDEA OF UM SO YOU LIKE MAYBE LIKE AN L. LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN TYPE OF REMOTE
I DON'T THINK ONE EXISTS
BE A GOOD IDEA
YEAH ALL THE OTHER UNIVERSAL REMOTES
UM I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SUCH A THING OUT THERE
I GUESS WE COULD DO SOME UH DO SOME RESEARCH ON OR ONE OF US COULD DO SOME RESEARCH ON IT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE UM MULTI FORMAT LIKE UM YOU KNOW PAL
N. T. S. C. REGION ONE
OKAY
OKAY
INTERESTING
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
UM ALL RIGHT
SO
I LI I'M LIKING THAT IDEA THIS IDEA OF A TOUCH SCREEN REMOTE WITH MULTI FORMAT FEATURES
UM
UM
LET'S SEE
MM
UH LET'S SEE
UM
YEAH YEAH OKAY
THINK THEY'RE JUST CALLED FACE PLATES
I DON'T KNOW
UM
MM
BUT IF WE'RE BUNDLING IT UNLESS WE'RE SELLING THEIR TELLY WITH THE REMOTE
UM
COU COULD WE NOT DO SOMETHING WHERE LIKE JUST A LITTLE LIT LIKE LITERALLY JUST A VERY SMALL KIND OF THING THAT COMES WITH THE REMOTE THAT YOU COULD PLACE SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU PRESS AND IT MAKES THE REMOTE PAGE
KINDA LIKE HOW ON A LOT OF UM UH CORDLESS REGULAR PHONES YOU HAVE A PAGE BUTTON AND IT GOES COULD WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM YEAH I THINK THIS MATERIAL QUALITY AS WELL LIKE I GUESS WHAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF UM UH YOU KNOW APPLE 'S BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL WITH THIS SURGICAL WHITE KIND OF BUSINESS OR THIS SLEEK KIND OF YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
WE DO HAVE THE MINIMUM AM AMOUNT I MEAN WE WERE TALKING FINANCES I DUNNO SELLING A A FORTY POUND REMOTE WOULD H OR A FORTY DOLLAR REMOTE
TWENTY FIVE EURO REMOTE WOULD BE PRETTY YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE SO MAYBE WE MIGHT WANNA TRADE OFF SOME OF THE FEATURES FOR A LOWER PRICE
WITHOUT WITHOUT GETTING INTO THAT WHOLE LIKE YOU KNOW GO DOWN TO BARGAIN STORE REMOTE YOU KNOW BARGAIN STORE UNIVERSAL REMOTE THAT'S BLACK AND YOU KNOW M MASSIVE
SOME KIND OF I DUNNO A BALANCE THERE IN SOMEWHERE
BUT UM HAVE A THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO HAVE A THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO HOW WE'RE GONNA SELL IT AND UM
MM
TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEAH
THEY'RE ALL WEAKER THAN THEY'RE ALL STRONGER THAN THE DOLLAR
ALTHOUGH COMPUTER PARTS ALL IF YOU'RE GONNA UPGRADE YOUR COMPUTER BUY IT IN THE STATES
LIKE UM DO YOU GUYS KNOW FRY'S
HUGE COMPUTER UH ELECTRONICS STORE
THEY SERVE UM RIGHT THEY SA THA S THEY WILL SELL THINGS OVERSEAS SO YOU CAN BUY STUFF IN AMERICA AND HAVE IT SHIPPED OVER FOR LIKE TWENTY THIRTY POUNDS ABOUT
RIGHT SO UM LET'S GO AHEAD AND WRAP THAT UP HERE FOR NOW I'M GONNA PUT THESE INITIAL IDEAS THAT WE'VE GOT IN THE UM PROJECT DOCUMENTS
SO IF YOU GUYS WA NEED A REMINDER ABOUT WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UM THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW KIND OF TRADE OFFS THAT WE'VE GOT AND THE OTHER IDEAS
YOU CAN CONSULT THEM AT YOUR LEISURE
AND UH RIGHT SO THANKS FOR THAT
LET'S JUST UH HEAD BACK TO WORK ON WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEF UH GOI H H GETTING INTO
UM
YES
THANKS GUYS
GUESS I SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO SIT UP STRAIGHT
OH I THINK MINE'S FALLEN OFF
WOW
OH YEAH THAT'S FINE
RIGHT
I'M NATHAN I'M FROM CALIFORNIA AND I'M HERE DOING A MASTERS DEGREE IN SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY
U. C. L. A.
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
WOW
NO
SOUNDS NICE
OH WOW
THERE'S MORE VOMIT THERE
ALRIGHT
YEP
UM
LET'S SEE
YEAH THAT'S THE MUSIC I GREW UP LISTENING TO
AND SO THERE
SOMETHING I MISS ABOUT MY HOMETOWN
BURRITOS
THAT COST LESS THAN EIGHT POUNDS
I GREW UP IN SAN DIEGO BUT YEAH UM LA JOLLA P. B.
BUT REALLY UH I LAST LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO I HAVEN'T LIVED IN CALI WELL I HAVEN'T LIVED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SINCE I WAS EIGHTEEN
IT'S DIFFERENT
'CAUSE IN SAN DIEGO TH THE TORTILLAS ARE COOKED ON THE GRILL AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY STEAM THEM
YEAH IT REALLY DOES
MM
YEAH
WHERE YOU FROM IN SAN DIEGO
OKAY
YEAH MY GRANDPARENTS LIVED ON UM THIRTY SECOND
CLOSE T UH DO YOU KNOW WHERE CLARE DE LUNE COFFEE SHOP IS AND
CAFE FORTE
COOL
YEAH
WOW
OKAY
MM
SOUNDS INTERESTING
MAYBE OUR PERSONAL COACH WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT
YEAH
MAYBE A REMOTE WITH CHANGEABLE FACES LIKE THE FACES THAT YOU CAN BUY FOR PHONES
YEAH
YEAH
S SMALLER'S BETTER
SIMPLE
OH RIGHT
THAT'D BE DIFFERENT
YEAH
IT'S GONNA BE TOO COMPLICATED TOO CROWDED WITH BUTTONS AND THINGS
NEEDS IT NEEDS ONE OUTSTANDING FEATURE TO SET IT APART FROM ALL THE OTHER REMOTES
RIGHT
I THINK MAKING IT OUT OF A NICE MATERIAL WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT
BECAUSE SO MANY OF THOSE REMOTES THAT YOU SEE THESE UNIVERSAL REMOTES LOOK SO CHEAP AND LOW QUALITY
MM
SOMETHING UH WE'LL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A NAME PATENT IT
LEOPARD PRINT
I THINK IT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A BAD IDEA TO HAVE A LIKE A LOCATOR DEVICE
MAYBE A SIMPLE BUTTON THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR TELEVISION TO HELP YOU FIND YOUR REMOTE
MM
TRUE
YEAH
I THINK SO
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
'S TRUE
OKAY
ALRIGHT
HOW'RE WE PLACED IN TERMS OF THE ALRIGHT
IT FELL
THAT'S WHY
AH
SURE
MM
I'M RON
I UH ONCE UPON A TIME STUDIED IN VICTORIA AND I AM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
GO FOR IT
ALRIGHT
THINK I'M JUST GONNA PUT DOWN ONE UH ONE C. D.
ANYBODY
NO
NO
AFRO BEAT ORCHESTRA VERY COOL
YEAH
FIFT S THEY LIKE FIFTEEN MEMBERS FROM BROOKLYN
UM AND I'M HOPING TO GO TO THE CONCERT IN BELGIUM IN BRUSSELS IN APRIL FIRST
YEAH
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN BRUSSELS ANYWAYS
UM THING I LOVE ABOUT EDINBURGH
LOVE UM
I JUST CAME FROM GLASGOW AND I'M UM HAPPY TO SAY THAT THERE'S THE THERE'S THE SAME QUANTITY APPROXIMATELY
UM
I W
DOES UH YEAH
READY
MINGING
NICE
UH-HUH
NICE
NICE
I ASSUME THAT WE'RE BUILDING A STAND ALONE UH REMOTE CONTROL WE CAN'T KIND OF BUILD IT INTO OTHER UH PRODUCTS
FOR INSTANCE LIKE A MOBILE PHONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OR OR YOU KNOW CAN WE PRODU CAN WE SELL A REMOTE CONTROL PHONE FOR TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OR LESS
YEP
OKAY
MM-HMM
NICE
HOT
NOW ARE WE ALSO DISCUSSING KIND OF OUR INITIAL IDEAS AT ALL HERE
S DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY INITIAL IDEAS
BUT I'M THINKING I'M THINKING KIND OF P. D. A. UH DESIGN SO TOUCH SCREEN DESIGN RATHER THAN BUTTON SO THAT YOU CAN KIND OF FLIP AROUND ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS
TOO CONFUSING
MM-HMM
POSSIBLY
I'M PRETTY SURE THERE IS
I MEAN I I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A P. D. A. THAT HE JUST POINTS AT HIS TELEV ANY TELEVISION HE WANTS AND IT'LL FIGURE OUT THE THE SPECIFICATIONS OF IT AND WILL CONTROL IT UM SO I TH I ASSUME THAT THAT CAN BE DONE WITH UH KIND OF AROUND THE WORLD
OH
I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE UH MULTI PLATE
IN IN
I LIKE
WE SHOULD C WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A FUZZY ONE AS WELL
FOR THOSE COLD WINTER DAYS
WELL IF WE BUNDLE IT AS A PHONE THEN YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL IT
IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT THEN WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT JUST KIND OF RINGS FROM EITHER WELL THERE USED TO BE THOSE WHISTLING DEVICES BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ANNOYING
TH
YEAH
THAT'S COOL
I THINK WE COULD DESIGN INTO THAT
CURVES
WE'RE TALKING TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OR TWENTY FIVE EUROS
SLIGHT DIFFERENCE I GUESS
NO
THANK YOU
ARE YOU SURE I GOT IT ALL HEAD'S KINDA SMALL
OKAY
WE'RE OKAY
WE'RE GOOD
I GUESS IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO DRINK COFFEE
MM
UH OKAY
VERY OFFICIAL
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BELIEVE ME WE'LL GO FROM THERE
FAIR ENOUGH
PROVE IT YEAH OKAY
WORKS FOR ME
THERE YOU GO
I'M SARAH I WENT TO MICHIGAN AND I'M HERE DOING CULTURAL STUDIES AND I'M THE MARKETING MANAGER OR SOMETHING
MARKETING YEAH EXPERT
EXPERT
FINE
THAT'S ME
SO
SO DO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOU TO WRITE IT DOWN OR ARE YOU GONNA TELL US
I'M WAITING TO KNOW
UH
FAIR ENOUGH
OH SMALLVILLE
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH TOM WILLING ACTUALLY
THE GUY
YEAH
YEAH
VERY MUCH SO
HELL OF A SOCCER PLAYER BUT A TOTAL BASTARD NONETHELESS
YEAH
HE IS A BIG GUY
YEAH
MM-HMM
GOOD CALL
INTERESTING
I GUESS I'LL GO NEXT THEN
OKAY
DON'T WANNA LOSE ALL MY MIKES PLUGGED IN HERE
OKAY
THIS IS BASICALLY JUST PEN PRACTICE HUH
OKAY
OH YOU'RE MUCH TALLER THAN ME SO I'M GONNA WRITE DOWN HERE
UM
RIGHT NOW I'M LISTENING TO A LOT OF SOMEBODY NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF CHRIS BATHGATE LOCAL MICHIGAN FOLK SINGER REALLY LAME AND UH
UH WHAT ELSE DID I BRING WITH ME
PROBABLY CLASSICAL TO TOTALLY GEEK IT OUT YEAH I THINK
AND MY FAMILY GUY D. V. D. S BUT WE DON'T NEED TO WRITE THAT ONE DOWN
SO YEAH
NO
ARE YOU GETTING IT ONLINE OR IS IT ON SKY
YEAH THAT'D BE NICE
'FRAID NOT
MM
EXCITING
THAT'D BE
OH
I DIDN'T EVEN READ THOSE
OOPS
I SHOULDN'T ADMIT THAT
YEAH
IT'S THE FIVE BY FIVE I CAN'T READ THAT MUCH
YEAH OH IT'S SO HORRIBLE
OH MY GOD
SERIOUSLY
IT REALLY IS
YEAH
SLIDE IT IN THERE
YEAH
YEAH FAIR ENOUGH
I'VE ALREADY GOT MORE THAN I CAN KEEP TRACK OF
AND I'M GONNA GO HOME NEXT WEEK AND EVERYONE'S GONNA BE LIKE OH MY GOD YOU'RE TURNING INTO ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE NO
I KNOW
I KNOW
OH IT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
WAIT UNTIL I TELL THEM I'M NOT COMING BACK
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE THAT ONE
PROBABLY
OR AT LEAST GET A WORK VISA FOR A WHILE AND THEN DECIDE
'CAUSE NICE
OF COURSE
OH NOW I CAN THINK OF SO MANY OTHER ONES
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
MM
OH
ANY THING THAT ARE LIKE FREE
NICE
IT MUST MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
AH
RIGHT
MM
THERE YOU GO
MM
MAKES SENSE
UH
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
AND NEGOTIATE THAT
UH
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY RULES ABOUT IT YET
SO
YEAH
MM
W YEAH
I LIKE THE LITTLE COVER THINGIES
HMM
GOOD IDEA
START YOUR MINUTES
UM
WELL IT'S PRETTY MUCH GIVEN IT'S GONNA BE UNIVERSAL RIGHT WE DECIDED THAT ALREADY AND IT MAY BE FUNCTIONING FOR OTHER THINGS
AS SOON AS YOU SAID THAT I WAS THINKING LIKE ALL THE OTHER THINGS YOU COULD GET A REMOTE TO DO
LIKE YOUR MICROWAVE OR YOUR FRONT DOOR OR LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING ON ONE THING
BUT THEN I'VE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF THOSE HUGE REMOTES THAT HAVE LIKE A MILLION BUTTONS YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT THEY DO
YEAH
SPECIFIC
OKAY
INTERESTING
TRUE
MM
MM
RIGHT
WE WANT IT TO BE MUNT MULTIFUNCTIONAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU GET IT TO DO TOO MUCH YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TELL THEM APART
THAT WHOLE YEAH
HMM
MM
AN INTERESTING OPTION
YEAH
DEFINITELY
RIGHT
THAT
YEAH
AWESOME
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
KEEPING IT NICE AND SLICK WOULD BE IMPORTANT
AND
I DON'T KNOW LIKE THERE'S SUCH A PROBLEM WITH LOSING THEM
THAT ADDING THIS WHOLE LIKE P. D. A. PEN BUSINESS IS ONLY ONE MORE THING TO LOSE SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT LIKE
JUST SOMETHING LIKE KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE START ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THIS STUFF BUT THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL
YEAH
FI B LIKE WHAT ARE THEY CALLED THOSE FACE PLATE THINGS
ISN'T THERE A NAME FOR THEM
ARE THEY
I DUNNO
YEAH
SOMETHING REALLY COOL
LEOPARD PRINT OR SOMETHING
HMM
TRUE
RIGHT
TRUE
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
PROBABLY
GOOD
MM
YEAH
AND THAT TITANIUM THE NEW SILVER SLEEK ONES THAT'S LAST COUPLE OF YEARS VERY MUCH SO
MM
RIGHT
RIGHT
MM
DEFINITELY
YEAH
OR IF YOU OUR USERS IN MIND LIKE THESE GRANDMAS ARE NOT GONNA BE INTO THIS WHOLE NEW LET'S DESIGN
NO IT'S THEY'RE USED TO THE BUTTONS SO WE'LL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF EXACTLY WHO WE'RE MARKETING THIS TO
AND WHO WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET IT OUT OF
BUT
EUROS
MM
MM MM
MM
OKAY
WITH HALF AN HOUR
'KAY
PERFECT
COOL
ALL SET
OKAY
COOL
RIGHT
SO UM BASICALLY I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER REAL QUICKLY UM SOME NEWS I'VE JUST GOT FROM THE BOARD ON HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS UM REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEN I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO YOU GUYS TO MAKE BRIEF PRESENTATIONS UM ON WHAT YOU'VE FOUND AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A BIT OF DISCUSSION
SO BASICALLY UH WHAT I'VE JUST FOUND OUT FROM THE BOARD I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS GOT THIS EMAIL AS WELL BUT IT NEEDS TO BE TELEVISION ONLY
SO NO WE'RE NOT DOING D. V. D. WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE IT'S JUST GONNA BE A TELEVISION REMOTE
UM IT ALSO NEEDS TO HAVE THE COMPANY COLOURS INCLUDED IN IT
UM SO THAT'S RED AND BLACK
AND IT HAS TO HAVE THE SLOGAN CASE YOU GUYS FORGET THE SLOGAN IT'S WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
UM AND NO TELETEXT
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TELETEXT IS BUT I'M ASSUMING YOU GUYS DO SO WE DON'T WANNA INCLUDE THAT UM IN THIS PARTICULAR DESIGN
FOR REASONS THAT I DON'T REALLY KNOW
THERE'S BUT IT'S THE BOARD SO THERE YOU GO
SO BASICALLY UM GIVEN THOSE GUIDELINES WHICH WILL HAVE SOME EFFECT ON HOW WE DESIGN WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER I MEAN 'CAUSE IT'S TELEVISION ONLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO CHANGE OUR UH UM
WELL WE CAN S SACRIFICE MORE FUNCTION FOR A BETTER TELEVISION REMOTE
ANYWAY
SO I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UH TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE A PRESENTATION ON
OH RIGHT YEAH
YEP
MIGHT HAVE TO HIT FUNCTION F. EIGHT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA COME UP
YEP
COOL
BRILLIANT
'KAY
MM
'KAY
FAIR ENOUGH
'KAY
IS IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN USE UM MODERN TYPES OF POLYMERS
OR MO MODERN TYPES OF PLASTICS THAT MAYBE DO HAVE SOME KIND OF AESTHETIC VALUE UM LIKE IF A WHITE LIKE IF WE TALK ABOUT LIKE WELL LIKE ON THE LAPT ON THESE LAPTOPS AND OTHER ONES THEY USE A A PRETTY NICE
YOU CAN DO I IS THERE SOME KIND OF NICE COLO DER QUALITY PLASTIC THAT WE CAN WORK WITH
OKAY OKAY
GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NATHAN
UM IF NEXT WE CAN HAVE THE UM USER INTERFACE DEVELOPER GO AHEAD AND MAKE A BRIEF PRESENTATION THAT'D BE GREAT AS WELL
S PLUG YOURSELF IN HERE
MM
UM HIT FUNCTION F. EIGHT REAL QUICKLY HOLD DOWN
MM
THERE YOU GO
SWEET
YEAH SORRY I COULDN'T GET THAT G TO USE BEFORE
OH YEAH LOOK AT THAT
MM-HMM
NICE
OKAY
GREAT
THANKS FOR THAT RON
'KAY YEP THAT'S YOU
GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT
THAT'S GREAT
THANK YOU SARAH
RIGHT
SO UM YEP I'LL JUST UH SWITCH THAT BACK HERE
I'LL FINISH UP WITH JUST A BIT OF DISCUSSION PLAN ON FOR THE NEXT PHASE
RIGHT SO I THINK WE'VE COVERED MOST OF THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THROUGH THIS UM THROUGH YOU GUYS'S PRESENTATIONS UM WE'VE GOT UH Y THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SUGGESTS UH OR PRETTY MUCH EMPHATICALLY SUGGESTED THAT WE NEED TO GO WITH PLASTIC
UM SARAH SHE'S RECOMMENDED THAT WE GO FOR SIMPLER FUNCTIONS SO FEWER FUNCTIONS UM BUT WE NEED TO DECIDE WHO ARE WE SELLING THIS TO
YOU S YOUR STATS SUGGESTED THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE UNDER THIRTY FIVE WANTED THOUGHT ABOUT VOICE CONTROL
UM SO DO WE WANNA GO FOR THAT OR DO WE WANT TO GO FOR AN OLDER DEMOGRAPHIC
AND MY THOUGHT IS UM WE'VE GOT W IF WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A SLEEK LOOK I MEAN WE ARE PUTTING THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS UM
YES
SO MAYBE THIS WE SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC
UM
SO
UH WE NEED TO WONDER AH H ABOUT HOW WE MAKE IT BETTER AND SMALLER AND FASTER UM THINK WE'RE CONSTRAINED TO PLASTICS VERY WELL WE'VE GOT THIS IDEA
RON WAS SAYING WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT UH REVOLUTIONISING THE WAY IT'S LOOKING UM
WHICH MIGHT BE EASIER GIVEN THAT WE'RE GOING FOR SIMPLER FUNCTION AND THAT WE'RE ONLY GOING FOR A TELLY
UM SO UM
HOW TH THIS VOICE OPERATION THING IS I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA UM ASSUMING THAT IT'S DOABLE
UM AT LEAST FOR THE BASIC CONTROLS MAYBE WE CAN BALANCE IT THAT WAY YOU KNOW WE CAN SEE
OKAY YOU CAN'T SAY RECORD ALIAS TONIGHT AT SEVEN P. M. BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY UM VOLUME UP
MM
RIGHT
THE DIFFICULTY WH WOULD BE IN UM I THINK LIKE I YOU COULDN'T SPEAK INTO THE REMOTE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND
'KAY YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT PICKS UP
A VOICE FROM FAR AWAY
IF IT'S HIDDEN UNDER THE COUCH BUT THEN AGAIN YOU HAVE THIS WEE THIS WEE THING YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A LITTLE CHIP OR WHATEVER THAT HAS THE PAGE BUTTON
MAYBE THAT COULD BE VOICE ACTIVATED TOO
YEAH
OR AN ISOLATED MAGNET OR SOMETHING LIKE OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T INTERFERE I DON'T KNOW THAT'D BE THE TECHNICAL THING BUT YEAH I LIKE THAT
I LIKE THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE PAGING SYSTEM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
ABSOLUTELY
MM 'KAY UM WELL YEAH I GUESS WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE UM IN A LA SLIGHTLY LATER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT UM BUT YEAH I KNOW THAT'S PERFECTLY VIABLE QUESTION
MM 'KAY UM SO I'M SEEING THAT WE'RE GONNA JUST BASICALLY FOCUS ON THIS YOUNG DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP AIM IT AT THEM
BUT THEN IN A SENSE THAT ITS BELLS AND WHISTLES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS THEM BUT BASICALLY WE'LL MAKE A SLEEK SIMPLE FUNCTIONED UM UH REMOTE CONTROL
UM I THINK THIS VOICE RECOGNITION THING IS A WE'VE GOT A MARKET FOR IT UH I DON'T THINK THERE'S TOO MANY
WE'D MORE OR LESS BE CORNERING THE MARKET ON IT AS WELL WE DON'T HAVE MANY UM
I APPEAR TO HAVE LOST MY MICROPHONE
MM
RIGHT UM WE DON'T HAVE MANY PEOPLE OR THERE'S NOT VERY MANY COMPETITORS OUT THERE THAT DO THAT SO COOL
UM RIGHT
I GUESS WE'VE C WE'VE TOUCHED ON MOST OF THIS
THE IDEA OF A PAGING FUNCTION A TOUCH SCREEN AND FACE PLATES
UM
THE THING WITH I SEE WOULD THERE NOT BE A WE'D HAVE TO MAYBE SACRIFICE THE FACE PLATES FOR A TOUCH SCREEN
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH 'CAUSE THEN HA YOU WOULD HAVE TO WHO ALL IT'S NOT LIKE WITH CELL PHONES LIKE WHERE YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW NOKIA MODEL X. AND THEN TEN PEOPLE MAKE FACE PLATES FOR IT
WE'D BE JUST OUR MODEL OF PHO OF T REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
ALRIGHT WELL WE CAN WE CAN DISCUSS THAT ONE FURTHER WHEN WE THINK ABOUT UM WHETHER TH WHEN WE DO COSTS AND SO FORTH UM
TRUE
IF PLASTIC IS DEAD CHEAP AND IF WE'RE MAKING THE WHOLE THING OUT OF PLASTIC ANYWAY UM YEAH WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE LATER UM BUT YEAH WE WILL HAVE TO EVALUATE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
UM I THINK WE'VE HAD A BIT OF DISCUSSION ALREADY ON THIS THING N S THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THAT CAME UP IN THESE PRESENTATIONS
YEAH YEAH OKAY
UM
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE BEST
LET'S BASED ON WHAT SH ON WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE ALL SAID TO ME LET'S GO FOR A PLASTIC
BUILT OR UH B PLASTIC CASED 'CAUSE THA THA THAT'S EASY ON THE COST
TRY TO LOOK FOR SOME KIND OF HIGH QUALITY RECYCLED PLASTIC AS YOU RECOMMENDED AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA
WITH A TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE BASIC FUNCTIONS
UM
AND WE'LL YEAH THA LET'S PROVISIONALLY LET'S GO FOR A TOUCH SCREEN ONE WITH SEVERAL SUBMENUS UM FOR POSSIBLE EXTRA STUFF THAT ONE BASICALLY PUT THE CHANNEL AND THE ON AND OFF SWITCH ON THE TOUCH SCREEN
UM DO WE HAVE
MM WAIT A MINUTE IT OCCURS TO ME THAT IF WE HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RECHARGE THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS
YET AT THE SAME TIME THAT MIGHT HELP FOR THIS WHOLE COMPLAINT OF IT BEING LOST
MM-HMM
BUT THEN AGAIN THAT COSTS AS WELL
HMM
DO THEY
OKAY
WELL I I DON'T THINK YEAH I CAN'T SEE ANYBODY BUYING A LAP A REMOTE CONTROL THAT THEY HAVE TO PLUG IN SO WE'D HAVE TO SEE SOME KIND OF NEW BATTERY TECHNOLOGY
OKAY SO LET'S GO WITH A UM TOUCH SCREEN
WITH UM SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW WITH WITH SOME KIND OF CUTTING EDGE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY
YEAH WELL HEY YOU KNOW WELL IT'S IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO
IF NOT WE CAN ALWAYS DEFAULT TO JUST DOING A A WELL PRESENTED PLASTIC SIMPLE YOU KNOW SO YOU KNOW
WELL YEAH I MEAN YOU CAN PUT THE WE COULD I I DUNNO I MEAN I SUPPOSE WE COULD PUT THE THE BASICS ON THE CENTRE EASIEST YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW PEOPLE KNOW THE CHANNEL AND VOLUME FUNCTION MAKE THEM LARGE AND EASY TO GET AT AND THEN THE THE OTHER THE OTHER BITS AND BOBS YOU KNOW GO THROUGH MENU UM W WE'LL DO THE AESTHETICS
OKAY SO WE'LL TOUCH SCREEN AND THE BATTERY FOCUS ON UM UH PRESENTATION
UM IT'S TH UH WITH THIS VOICE RECOGNITION OPTION AS WELL UM JUST AS FOR THE SIMPLE FUNCTIONS THE UM THE ON OFF CHANNELS VOLUME UM
AND UM A SMALL PAGING FUNCTION
EVEN IF YOU CAN'T DO VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE PAGING YOU KNOW JUST SOME KIND OF SIMPLE BUTTON THAT'S JUST A I GUESS ANOTHER INFRARED SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WHILE TO EMIT SOME KIND OF PAGING
JUST A BEEP
UM RIGHT SO ANY COMMENTS
THOUGHTS BEFORE WE BREAK INTO GO INTO THE NEXT ROUND OF INDIVIDUAL WORK ON THIS
W IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO A SKIN YOU'D NEED TO HAVE SOME WAY FOR PEOPLE TO DOWNLOAD OR IMPORT SKINS INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH I THINK PERHAPS GOOD IDEA BUT YEAH I THINK THAT THAT ONE M MIGHT JUST BE UM
AND THEY JUST YEAH I THINK THAT ONE MIGHT JUST BE OUT OF THE RANGE FOR THIS PARTICULAR A P. D. A. WOULD THEY WOULD MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FOR A P. D. A. 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE USING IT TO CONNECT UP TO THINGS ANYWAY BUT
I DUNNO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
HMM
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW I D IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD SUFFICE TO HAVE JUST THE R. R. ON THERE
JUS
BUT APPARENTLY NOT
SO
YEAH
WELL FAIR ENOUGH
UM AND YEAH THAT WOULD HELP THE BATTERY LIFE TOO AND IF IT THE REMOTE THEY DO HAVE TO PRESS A BUTTON FOR THE REMOTE TO TURN ON
BUT THEN AGAIN WHO WANTS TO TURN ON A REMOTE CONTROL
KIND OF IF I
OH TO WAKE UP OKAY OR GO INTO LIKE A DORMANT MODE
OKAY
OH YEAH I LIKE THAT I LIKE THE IDEA OF UM PUTTING THE LOGO IN THE BOOT UP SCREEN NICE
UM
UM COOL SO ANY LAST THINGS BEFORE WE BREAK
ALRIGHT
FAIR ENOUGH
SOUNDS GOOD
I'M GONNA SAVE TH A COPY OF THIS IN CASE YOU GUYS NEED ANY REMINDERS
I'M GONNA SAVE A COPY OF THIS AND THE MINUTES THAT I'LL DO IT IN A SECOND AND PUT THEM IN THE SHARED FOLDER FOR LATER REFERENCE
BRILLIANT
THAT'S FAB GUYS
COOL
OKAY
SO DO I UNPLUG THIS BIT HERE
OKAY
RIGHT
THAT'S PAGE ONE OF MY PRESENTATION
SO THE UH METHOD
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW REMOTE CONTROLS WORK AND RES UH SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THIS PROJECT
UM REMOTE CONTROL WORKS AS FOLLOWS
THIS IS ALL PRETTY BASIC STUFF YOU GUYS
UM SENDS MESSAGE TO ANOTHER SYSTEM
SO THERE'S AN ENERGY SOURCE INVOLVED IN THAT LIKE A BATTERY OR SOLAR POWER SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES THERE'S AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT
WHICH IS THE MICROCHIP UM AND THAT ACTUALLY COMPOSE THE MESSAGES AND USUALLY THE WAY A A REMOTE CONTROL WORKS IS IT SENDS INFRARED BITS TO ANOTHER SYSTEM
A USER INTERFACE CONTROLS THE CHIP BASICALLY THAT'S THE CASING AND THE BUTTONS AND UM ACCORDINGLY THE MESSAGES AS WELL
SO MY FINDINGS
UM I JUST DID A PRELIMINARY STUDY HERE AND UH I FOUND THAT TOO MUCH METAL IN REMOTE DESIGN COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE INTERFERENCE WITH THE ABILITY OF THE REMOTE TO SEND COMMANDS
AND TOO MUCH METAL CAN CAUSE REMOTES TO BEHAVE UNEXPECTEDLY BY RECEIVING FALSE SIGNALS
UM TOO MUCH METAL IS USED SOMETIMES AND PEOPLE PICK UP RADIO SIGNALS AND THE LIKE
AND THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF THE REMOTE CATCHING ON FIRE AND INJURING THE CUSTOMER JUST THINK OF THOSE LAWSUITS THAT'D BE REALLY BAD
THEREFORE I SUGGEST PRIMARILY PLASTIC CONSTRUCTION
UM COMPONENTS
JUST SOME IDEAS THAT I HAD UM ENERGY SOURCE
IT'S KINDA HIP TO BE ECO FRIENDLY SO I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD DO SOMETHING WITH SOLAR POWER WITH AN ALKALINE BATTERY BACKUP
UM THE USER INTERFACE I WAS SINCE WE CAN'T USE METAL I WAS THINKING MAYBE A HIGH GRADE RECYCLED PLASTIC
THE CHIP UM SILICON BASED CHIP I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY WAY AROUND THAT WE CAN'T REALLY BE DIFFERENT IN THAT RESPECT
UM THE SENDER WELL I'M THINKING INFRARED 'CAUSE IT IS THE INDUSTRY STANDARD
MULTI CHANNEL THAT'S A WORD I MADE UP I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
UH PAL AND N. T. S. C. COMPATIBLE AND UH PROBABLY A TWO HUNDRED FOOT RANGE
UH AND THE RECEIVER OF COURSE IS ANY NUMBER OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES
UM BUT IN THIS CASE IT'LL ONLY BE T. V. S
UM PERSONAL PREFERENCES I REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD USE PLASTIC AS OPPOSED TO METAL UM
THE COMPANY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD THIS KINDS OF LAWSUITS WHICH ADM ADMITTEDLY IS GONNA COME AT THE COST OF A CERTAIN AESTHETIC VALUE 'CAUSE WE WERE THINKING
RIGHT
YEAH THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
UM FOR EXAMPLE THE PLASTIC THEY HAVE ON YOUR LAPTOP THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO
THAT'S THE END OF MY PRESENTATION
IS IT PLUGGED IN WELL
THERE IT GOES
COMPUTER ADJUSTING
MM
MM
RIGHT
I THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO UH COMBINE THE LOCATOR DEVICE AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY
WITH A SIMPLE COMMAND LIKE LOCATE
AND THEN IT COULD START TO BEEP AND
THEREFORE BE FOUND
OH YEAH I THINK THAT'S VERY DOABLE
MM
IT'S A GOOD POINT
YEAH
MM
I WAS THINKING UH
OH GO AHEAD
YEAH
GOTTA WONDER THOUGH IF WE'RE ADDING SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY TO THIS ONE REMOTE
ARE WE STILL GONNA BE ABLE TO MEET OUT TWELVE POU OUR TWELVE FIFTY EURO YOU KNOW GOAL FOR SELLING THESE THINGS
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HANDLE ALL THESE FUNCTIONS WITH JUST ONE MICROCHIP
THE MICROCHIP IS PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART OF THE THE WHOLE MECHANISM
SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER
BACK TO THE UH THE COST THE MATERIAL
WE HAVE TO ASK WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO INCLUDE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FACE PLATES WITH THE PACKAGE
THAT'S SOMETHING I W FOR SAY WE'RE INCLUDING THREE OR FOUR FACE PLATES IT'S GONNA DRIVE THE COST UP
AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS IF WE DO INCLUDE THEM ARE WE REALLY IN A POSITION TO EVALUATE THAT MARKET
WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY TESTS ON FACE PLATES AND WHETHER
SEE IF THERE IF THERE'S EVEN INTEREST OUT THERE
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IT SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE A GIMMICK THAT WOULDN'T REALLY GO ANYWHERE
YEAH
CAN WE AFFORD TO INCLUDE ONE OF THOSE
RIGHT
OKAY
SINCE WE'RE DOING UH TOUCH SCREEN
DO WE WANNA LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO INPUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SKINS FOR THE YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL INTERFACE PART OF IT AND THINGS LIKE THAT
OR IS IT JUST GONNA BE ONE TOUCH SCREEN FOR EVERYBODY
WHAT WHAT WOULD BE ON THAT TOUCH SCREEN
'CAUSE YOU SAID EARLIER THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT COMPANY COLOURS AND UM
LOGO OR SOMETHING OR MOTTO I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID
'S TOO MUCH
THINK WE JUST NEED TO COME UP WITH A NICE BLACK AND RED INTERFACE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN
THAT'D BE OKAY
MM
TRUE
PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA WANT THEIR REMOTE TO BOOT UP AND TO SEE FLASHING THINGS COME ON
THEY JUST WANT IT TO BE ON AND READY TO GO
TH
WELL SO
HERE WE HAVE A UH MY TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN PRESENTATION
UM SO A FEW OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE NEED HERE
UH WE N BASICALLY NEED TO OPERATE AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE
IT NEEDS TO BE UNIVERSAL UM AND POSSIBLY UH OPERATE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVICES ALTHOUGH WE NOW UH FIND THAT UH THAT THAT'S NO PROBLEM
UM SO SOME OF MY FINDINGS
UM BASICALLY WANNA SEND MESSAGES UH TO A TELEVISION SET
UM THAT WOULD BE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS UH SUCH AS SWITCH ON THE TELEVISION
UH SWITCH TO THE NEXT CHANNEL THAT SORT OF THING I THINK WE'RE ALL QUITE UH
QUITE UH INTELLIGENT AND KNOW KNOW WHAT A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL DOES
UM NOW SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS I FOUND IS A A COMPLICATED REMOTE CONTROL SORRY THAT WE CAN'T QUITE SEE MY RED THERE VERY WELL BUT UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL HAS MANY FUNCTIONS UM SO IT CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS BUT IT UH IT IS QUITE COMPLICATED AND MOST USERS WILL FIND IT UH FIND THAT THEY WON'T USE MOST OF THE FUNCTIONS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THEM AND DON'T WANNA TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO DO IT
AS YOU ALSO NOTICE IT'S QUITE A BORING DESIGN
UM
ANOTHER REMOTE CONTROL SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IT'S A SIMPLER REMOTE CONTROL UH MANY LESS BUTTONS BUT UH HAS MANY FEWER FUNCTIONS
UM M MUCH EASIER FOR THE USER TO MANIPULATE AND USE
UM IT ALSO HAS A BIT OF A CHEAP LOOK AND IT'S ALSO QUITE BORING
SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
REVOLUTIONISE THE IDEA OF UH A REMOTE CONTROL
UM SO ATTAIN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF A COMPLICATED DEVICE BUT USE A SIMPLE FORMATTED DISPLAY UH FOR THE USER TO TO WORK WITH
AND I WAS GONNA ADD ANOTHER UH SLIDE HERE BUT I DIDN'T QUITE HAVE TIME THERE
UM
JUST INCORPORATING SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY LIKE UH HAVING MULTIPLE FACE BUT IT'S UH
I CAN PLUG YOU IN
SOUNDS GOOD
A LITTLE STICKY PAD TO STICK ON TOP OF YOUR UH TELEVISION
AND YOU JUST SAY SOMETHING TO INTO THAT AND IT
FINDS YOUR
THE OTHER THING IS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE SIMPLICITY OF A REMOTE CONTROL AND KIND OF PUT THE MORE COMPLICATED THINGS INTO A VOICE CONTROL
SO IT COULD BE SOLD TO BOTH THE YOUNGER MARKET AND THE OLDER MARKET
AND THE YOUNGER MARKET COULD USE KIND OF THE VOI VOICE CONTROL METHOD AND THE OLDER MARKET MIGHT MIGHT K EXACTLY AND MIGHT CONSIDER THE OLDER MARKET COULD USE THE SIMPLER DESIGN WITH THE TRADITIONAL BUTTONS AND WHAT NOT
'S DEFINITELY AN OPTION TECHNICALLY
I'VE LOOKED INTO UH COSTS OF UH TOUCH SCREEN METHODS AND WHAT NOT
THEY SEEM TO BE UH YOU KNOW ALMOST AS CHEAP AS A BUTTON METHOD AT THIS POINT
UM I'M NOT SURE THAT'S SINCERELY CORRECT
I THINK IF YOU KIND OF TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF A MOBILE PHONE THAT UH TRYING TO PASS A PORTION OF THE DEVICE IS NOT INTERCHANGEABLE WHEREAS THE SURROUNDING PORTIONS ARE INTERCHANGEABLE
WE COULD HAVE THE CASING THE THE FACE PLATES
WELL HOPEFULLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE PEOPLE COMING T OVER TO W TO HANG OUT AT YOUR HOUSE AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE THEIR TELEVISIONS IN THE LIVING ROOM
UH
SURE
WELL HAVE WE CONFIRMED THAT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD WITH A UH TOUCH SCREEN UM
INTERFACE
SO THESE NEW LITHIUM BATTERIES THEY LAST TWENTY YEARS EVEN WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN
THOSE NEW ONES
BE INTERESTING
WE PUT FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS
YEAH
UH I I'M I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT I'M WONDERING HOW WE'RE GONNA GET UH WE PUT FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS ONTO THIS DEVICE
I'M HOPING FOR A SUBLIMINAL MAYBE HALF A MILLISECOND AS IT TURNS ON
MM-HMM
WELL ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THE SCREEN AND IT AUTOMATICALLY GOES ON
YEP
GOES INTO A SLEEP MODE
I'VE PUT MY FILES IN THE SHARED FOLDER AS WELL
OKAY
GOTTA PLUG YOU IN
VERY NICE
FOR YOUR FIRST POWERPOINT IT'S LOVELY
FINE
IT NEEDS YEAH
COOL
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE IN OKAY
THERE YOU GO
RIGHT
DOES THAT MEAN I'M UP
I THINK SO
OKAY
OH THAT WOULD BE PERFECT
THANK YOU
SLIDE SHOW UP AND RUNNING
OR NOT
UH
OH THERE WE GO
PERFECT
OKAY
SO THIS IS ME
UM BASICALLY I WAS LOOKING THROUGH SOME MARKETING REPORTS THAT WE'VE GOT AND WE HAD A USABILITY TEST WHERE WE WERE ACTUALLY SORT LIKE WATCHING A HUNDRED PEOPLE USE T. V. REMOTES AND SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE USING AND THEN THEY FILLED OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T ABOUT THEIR GENERAL T. V. REMOTE CONTROL PRACTICES
UM PRETTY MUCH THROUGH TESTING WE WERE FINDING OUT THAT MOST OF THE TIME EVERYBODY'S USED TO USING CHANGING THE CHANNEL TURNING IT ON USING THE VOLUME
M THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME THAT'S ALL THAT'S GOING ON THE OTHER FUNCTIONS HAPPEN
FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY'RE IMPORTANT BUT THE PRIMARY USES ARE REALLY REALLY BASIC
UM AND SO BIG COMPLICATED REMOTES LIKE ONE WE SAW IN THE LAST PRESENTATION ARE REALLY NOT THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S USE
THEY'RE NOT USING A LOT OF IT THEY DON'T NEED IT
THEY EVEN FIND IT FRUSTRATING WHEN THERE ARE ALL THOSE BUTTONS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
AND UM WE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT UH FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR PEOPLE THEIR THE WORST THING ABOUT A REMOTE IS HOW OFTEN THEY LOSE IT
AND THEN THEY CAN'T FIND IT IN THE ROOM
SO I THINK WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH A PAGER OR SOMETHING WILL REALLY COME INTO PLAY WITH A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE
UM THERE'S ALSO A SURVEY ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKED ABOUT REMOTES AND PRETTY MUCH THEY ALL THINK THEY'RE HIDEOUS AND NOT VERY USEFUL
AND THE YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHICS ARE ALL REALLY INTERESTED IN VOICE RECOGNITION OPTIONS
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE READY TO LOOK INTO TECHNICALLY THAT'S UP TO THE DESIGN PEOPLE BUT IT IS S SOMETHING WORTH THINKING ABOUT
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC'S OBVIOUSLY THE ONE THAT'S GONNA KEEP GROWING SO IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED IN IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT
UM BUT BASICALLY IT REALLY IS THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS AND GETTING IT TO LOOK NICE WHICH ARE
THE STANDARDS
SO IT'S A GOOD START FOR US
NEED TO UNPLUG THIS
NEED IT BACK
THERE YOU GO
OH RIGHT
WE'RE NOT CATERING TO THE PENSIONERS OF THE WORLD I DON'T THINK SO
RIGHT
RIGHT
UH
RIGHT
YEAH
OH
THAT COULD WORK
I LIKE THAT
YEAH
SOMETHING VERY BASIC
RIGHT
IS THAT ONLY GONNA BE WITHIN OUR TWO HUNDRED FOOT RANGE THEN
OKAY
YEAH
MM
YEAH
K
YEAH
TRUE
MAKING IT JUST AN OPTION
YEAH
RIGHT
ARE WE STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS SCREEN SORRY
GO AHEAD
THE UH IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS TOUCH PAD SCREEN THING IT WOULD BE STILL DO WE KNOW IF THAT'S AN OPTION TECHNICALLY RIGHT NOW TO THAT
OKAY
OKAY
WE'RE DOING OKAY
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE AN INTERESTING OPTION ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEN YOU COULD HAVE LIKE YOUR PRIMARY SCREEN JUST BE THESE YOU KNOW FOUR OR FIVE BASIC FUNCTIONS
YOU CAN HAVE
MENU OPTIONS OR SOMETHING TO HAVE ALL THESE OTHER COMPLICATED VOICE RECOGNITION SETTINGS
THINGS THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE EVERY DAY AND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA USE BUT IT IS AN OPTION THERE FOR THIS HI TECH MARKET THAT SORT OF RE IS THE SLEEK THING WE'RE GOING FOR
TRUE
WORTH LOOKING INTO
YEAH
TRUE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
MM
JUST THE CASING
MM
YEAH
RIGHT
MM
RIGHT
WELL IN THE PUBLICITY OF A FACE PLATE ON A PHONE IS YOU HAVE IT OUT AND AROUND
IT IS SORT OF EMBLEMATIC WHEREAS YOU'RE JUST SIT AT HOME SO UNLESS SOMEBODY COMES OVER TO WATCH T. V.
TRUE
TRUE
TRUE
YEAH
OH YEAH
TRUE
'CAUSE IT WOULD HAVE A DOCKING BASE
YEAH
CAN WE AFFORD THAT
AND WILL SOMEBODY BUY IT IF WE DON'T
RIGHT
FOR TWELVE EUROS
IT IS
FAIR ENOUGH
THE BASICS
MM
'KAY
MM
AND OH
YEAH THE THE FASHION DO
YEAH
RIGHT AND THEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH PORTS AND CORDS AND
YEAH
FOR NOW
YEAH
NICE
UM
WELL BUT IF WE'RE GONNA USE A TOUCH SCREEN WHERE IT'S GONNA COME ON LIKE ON YOUR CELL PHONE IT'LL HAVE YOUR YOUR CARRIER PROVIDER NAME COME UP FIRST LIKE WHILE IT'S LOADING AND THEN IT GOES AWAY
PERHAPS IT COULD BE LIKE A TEMPORARY
COMES ON EVERY TIME YOU TURN IT ON AND THEN THAT'S IT 'CAUSE IT IS A BIT MUCH TO HAVE IT LIKE ENGRAVED ON THE BACK OR SOMETHING I THINK
YEAH
Y
YEAH YOU WOULD THINK
BUT
IF IT COMES FROM ABOVE
YEAH
MM
WE'RE GOOD
YEAH
THAT'S GREAT
ALRIGHT LET ME JUST POWERPOINT THIS UP
RIGHT SO UM THIS MEETING WILL BE ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
DON'T ASK ME S PRECISELY WHAT CONCEPTUAL DESIGN IS IT'S JUST SOMETHING IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO DO
UM THINK OF IT 'S KIND OF UH TURNING THE ABSTRACT INTO SLIGHTLY MORE CONCRETE
IN THIS MEETING IDEALLY WE'LL COME TO SOME FINAL DECISIONS ON WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR THE PROTOTYPE
UM
RIGHT SO UM APOLOGIES FOR THE LAST MEETING IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT I DID NOT MAKE THE ROLES CLEAR ENOUGH
UM SO I WILL ATTEMPT TO DO SO MORE ACCURATELY IN THIS PARTICULAR MEETING
UM FAIR ENOUGH THANKS FOR THE INPUT 'S ALWAYS GOOD
UM
SO BASICALLY ALL WE'RE GONNA DO IS HAVE SOME PRESENTATIONS AGAIN MUCH LIKE LAST TIME UM AND GONNA GO THROUGH YOU
UH WHOEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST IS F FINE BY ME UM AND WE'LL COLLATE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT UM WHAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE LAST MEETING POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS
AND THEN WE'LL MAKE SOME MORE DECISIONS ON UM BASIC UH FIRM UP OUR IDEA ON HOW WE WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL TO LOOK AND WORK
SO PERFECT
SO WITHOUT TH FURTHER ADO WHOEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST IS FREE TO
ALRIGHT NATHAN TAKE IT AWAY
IT IS NATHAN RIGHT
I'M NOT CALLING YOU THE WRONG NAME OVER AND OVER AGAIN
GOOD
NICE
MM
HMM
WHAT KIND OF TH THICKNESS ARE WE LOOKING AT
OKAY BRILLIANT
HMM
HMM
M MAYBE IS THERE AN OPTION THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT OFF OR ON SO A PERSON CAN SELECT LIKE
YEAH I LIKE THE IDEA IT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
CAN WE DO MARKETING PILOTING TOO
TRY TO SEE WHAT KIND BEFORE WE LAUNCH CAN WE SEE HOW THEY'RE RECEIVED
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY PERFECT
GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NATHAN
THAT'S PERFECT SO I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE FOR YOU TO TAKE IT FROM HERE
FASCINATING COMPELLING EVEN
TOMATOES
SLICK SLICK
INTERFACE OH THE INTERFACE GRAPHICS FOR THE UM
YEAH
MM
YEAH IT'S LIKE YEP IT'S UBIQUITOUS ISN'T IT
GREAT THANKS FOR THAT SARAH
RON
YEAH
LOT OF SINGLE PEOPLE ON THE UM ON THE RE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL RESEARCH TEAM AT THE
MM
MM
YEAH I CAN SEE
MM
GREAT
GREAT WONDERFUL RON COOL
LOT OF GOOD IDEAS GOOD FACTS TO HAVE
THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED IT'S LIKE A LITTLE DONGLE IT JUST STICKS UP THIS FURTHER SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND UP EVERY TIME
JUST CONNECT IT MY KINGDOM
RIGHT SO GOOD TO KNOW ALL THAT STUFF THANKS GUYS UM
NOW WE KIND OF HAVE TO COME TO SOME DECISIONS UM
I FIGURE WE CAN JUST GO DOWN THE LINE AND ALL THREE OF US CAN HAVE A CHAT ABOUT IT
UM
BASED ON WHAT NATHAN PRESENTED AS FAR AS THE UM VARIOUS COSTS AND BENEFITS UM I THINK
I DUNNO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THE TOUCH SCREEN AT THIS POINT
'KAY
'KAY
MM-HMM
TO PRODUCE EACH ONE
MM
HMM
WELL
THERE IS IT'S JUST IT IS A QUESTION OF AND HOW MUCH CA O DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INCREASE THE PRICE TO MAKE MONEY
UM FROM TWELVE FIFTY IF WE D WANNA GET OUR FIFT UH HUNDRED PER CENT PROFIT MARGIN UM THAT WOULD MEAN SELLING IT FROM TWENTY FIVE
IF YOU MULTIPLY SEVENTEEN FIFTY BY TWO THAT'S THIRTY FIVE
SO
FROM THE BOARD UM WELL
THAT'S TRUE I MEAN
AND THAT'S TO BE FAIR THE UM THE PER CENT OF THE MARKET WE'RE NOT GOING FOR MASS ANY YOU KNOW
MASS SALES ANYWAY WE'RE GONNA MAKE I MEAN WE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SELLING EIGHT ZILLION OF THESE THINGS
WE JUST COULDN'T NOT FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS SO
WE COULD PROBABLY MAYBE SHRINK THE PROFIT MARGINS RATHER THAN SELLING FOR TWENTY FIVE SELL 'EM FOR THIRTY BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HAVE FINANCE DEAL WITH
UM I SAY THAT WE PROVISIONALLY GO WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN OR WH Y WH WHAT WAS YOUR THOUGHT ON THE MATTER RON
MM
NO WE COULD HAVE A S VERY SIMPLE TOUCH SCREEN YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY
IF IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE IPOD OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW W WE YEAH I GUESS WE CAN PLAY AROUND WITH IT A BIT
ALRIGHT LET'S LET'S SAY THAT OKAY SO THE TOUCH SCREEN WILL BE OUR UM OUR MAIN SELLING POINT HERE
SO
THE VOICE REC THING I MEAN IF IF WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTTOM LINE
NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT UPPING THE COST TO SEVENTEEN TO GET THE TOUCH SCREEN ON I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO DROP THE VOICE REC
YEAH
HMM
WHAT DO YOU THINK ON IT NATHAN
ABOUT THE VOICE REC
MM
YEAH
I CAN'T SEE HOW IT WOULDN'T I MEAN THERE'S YOU KNOW THE OLD APHORISM YOU CAN HAVE IT FAST
YOU CAN HAVE IT CHEAP OR YOU CAN HAVE IT QUALITY PICK TWO OF THREE
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL THREE
IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE
WELL IF WE'RE GONNA PICK BETWE E ALRIGHT SO WE HAVE TO PICK BETWEEN ONE OF THE TWO
UM
OTHERWISE YEAH WE JUST IT JUST BECOMES COST PROHIBITIVE
WHAT WHICH WHICH DO WE SUSPECT WE SHOULD HOLD O WE SHOULD HOLD ON TO
'KAY
WHAT DOES THE COST LOOK LIKE RON
IS IT CHEAPER TO DO THE V. R. OR TO DO THE UH TOUCH SCREEN
NATHAN
MM
RIGHT
MM
OKAY
SO I'M GETTING ALRIGHT SO MORE OR LESS YOU GUYS THINK THAT O O OF THE TWO OF 'EM THE VOICE RECOGNITION WILL BE BETTER
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
SORTED
WE WILL OMIT THE TOUCH SCREEN IN FAVOUR OF VOICE RECOGNITION
YEAH WELL WE'LL WE'LL SIC WE'LL SORT OUT WHAT IT WHAT F WHAT ELSE WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT FOR THE PROTOTYPE BUT YEAH THAT'S OUR NEXT STEP
IT'LL BE A DEVELOPING OF PROTOTYPE
YES
WE'LL JUST RUN THROUGH IT YEAH YEAH UM
YOU DISCUSSED EITHER A LITHIUM OR A SOLAR POWER
WOULD THE SOLAR POWER BE ENOUGH TO FUEL A VOICE RECOGNITION
OR THIS KINESTHETIC ONE WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TO FUEL A VOICE RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL
MM
MM
YEP
RIGHT
OKAY
WHAT DO YOU THINK RON
OKAY
HMM
YEAH
WELL WE HAVE TO HAVE BUTTONS ON IT TOO AS WELL
BUT THAT'S DONE
THAT'S NO BOTHER I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE CATALOGUE FROM PLACES LIKE WITH SHARPER IMAGE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT HAVE OR LIKE UM WHO IS IT
APPLE MAKES THESE REALLY PRETENTIOUS SPEAKERS WITH THE TH SUB WOOFERS YOU KNOW LIKE CLEAR AND GLASS AND YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY GOT THESE LITTLE PYRAMIDAL TYPE OF UM SPEAKERS
I MEAN WHY NOT HAVE A LITTLE ROUNDED KIND OF THING IT COULD STILL HAVE THE BASIC BUTTONS ON IT
UM 'CAUSE WE'RE GOING FOR BASIC FUNCTIONALITY PRIMARILY AS WELL
AND MAYBE A MENU BUTTON AND SO FORTH
YOU KNOW UM USE A CHANNEL BUTTON TO SCROLL THROUGH THE MENU D IF THEY WANT TO RECORD PROGRAMMES OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW I MEAN WE CAN SORT THAT OUT
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I MEAN A NICE ALTHOUGH WE DO UM WH UH IS I'M RECALLING THAT SHE MENTIONED THAT WE N NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE SURGICAL WHITE KIND OF BRUSHED ALUMINIUM THING AND GET BACK TO IT BUT YOU COULD HAVE A VERY TASTEFUL UM WOOD COLOURED OR EARTH TONE KIND OF UM
STILL I MEAN YEAH ALONG THOSE LINES
YEAH I LIKE THAT I LIKE THAT IDEA A LOT
UM LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO AS FAR AS THAT GOES
AND THE UH THE MATERIAL LIKE THE PLASTICS AND SO FORTH WE WERE DISCUSSING THAT BEING UH USING LIKE A RUBBER KIND OF SOFTER FEEL
UM YOU KNOW LI LIK IF YOU FEEL THE THE TIP ON THIS PEN IT'S A BIT GIVES JUST A BIT
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHERE IT'S UH A A MORE ADVANCED F FORM OF PLASTIC THAT HAS SOME KIND OF A TACTILE RESPONSE TO IT
MM 'KAY
YEAH LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO A SQUISHY NON REMOTE CONTROL LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL
BUT TO BE FAIR YEAH I MEAN
YOU JUST C YOU COULD JUST PUT IT LITERALLY PUT IT ON THE THE NI THE COFFEE TABLE NEXT TO THE TELLY AND SAY VOLUME UP
YEAH I LIKE IT I LIKE THE IDEA THAT'S GOOD
UM AND WE'VE SORTED OF DISCUSSED COSTS UM
I GUESS WE'LL A THAT'S GONNA BE UH A THING IF WE RUN A BIT OVER BUDGET THAT MIGHT BE OKAY UM
WE'LL HAVE MORE OF AN IDEA WHEN THE PROTOTYPE
HAVE MORE OF A WE'LL HAVE MORE OF AN IDEA LATER ON
UM
AND WE JUST YEAH GO FROM THERE
UM SO WE'VE REVISITED THE TOUCH SCREEN AND MORE OR LESS RULED THAT OUT UM
I THINK SO WE'RE MORE OR LESS CON WE WH WH WE'RE MORE OR LESS IN AGREEMENT THAT WE WANT TO HAVE A UM A SIMPLE KIND OF FUNCTION
YOU KNOW NOT TOO COMPLEX
LIKE MAYBE HAVE MENU THINGS
MM
YES
YEAH WE'VE ALSO GOT THE THE ME THE THING OF IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A NON REMOTE LOOKING REMOTE HOW DO WE YEAH
B BUT NO I MEAN WE COULD DO A SLIDE OR A COMPARTMENT YOU KNOW
LIKE IF IT SAY IT'S A LIT LITTLE VAGUELY OVOIDAL TYPE OF THING IT'D BE EASY TO HAVE A COMPARTMENT IN THERE
OR YOU KNOW
A B A B A A SERIES OF YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR BUTTONS WITH A MENU BUTTON AND THEN A SIDE AN S UP AND DOWN TYPE OF THING
LIKE ON UM LIKE ON A D. V. D. PLAYER
YOU KNOW YOU SEE THE MODERN D. V. D. PLAYERS'LL JUST HAVE UM A MENU BUTTON ON THE SIDE AND THEN FOUR BUTTONS AROUND THEM AND YOU CAN JUST KIND OF MANOEUVRE THROUGH THE MENU LIKE THAT
WELL IT SEEMS LIKE I DUNNO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE COULD JUST DO THE UM STICK WITH THE RUBBER 'CAUSE SINCE WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE USING SOME KIND OF UM RUBBER FOR THE OUTSIDE CASE WE MIGHT AS WELL STICK WITH THAT UM
MM 'KAY UM
WE'VE ALREADY KIND OF COVERED THIS AS WELL
THAT SEEMS TO BE SELLING UM AND WE WE'VE MORE OR LESS AGREED THAT WE WANT TO KAR TARGET THIS YOUTH MARKET UM
ESPECIALLY NOW WITH EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS BEING SUCH A LARGE QUANTITY OF THE POPULATION
MM-HMM MM-HMM
OKAY
UM
YEAH ALRIGHT WELL
MORE OR LESS COVERED WHAT WE NEED TO COVER I THINK FI AN AN ANY FINAL THOUGHTS BEFORE WE THINK ABOUT DOING THE PROTOT MOVING ON TO THE PROTOTYPE
RIGHT
I WAS JUST GONNA STEP ON TO UM I WASN'T
OH MY BAD UM SORRY
THE UM YEAH OKAY I WAS JUST GONNA ASSIGN TASKS IN THE NEXT B ANYTH ANY OTH ANY OTHER FINAL THOUGHTS BEFORE WE GO AHEAD AND COOL
UM
YEAH
WELL THEN AGAIN COLOURS WOULDN'T BE SO HARD TO DO YOU COULD HAVE UH A YOU KNOW A UM UH KIND OF A NATURAL WOOD COLOUR
LIKE A STAINED WOOD AND UM I DON'T KNOW OLIVE GREEN OR SOMETHING
THAT WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH OF A PROBLEM TO INCORPORATE INTO THE COLOUR OF THE THING
YEAH I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD ID OKAY SO LET'S WORK ON UH MULTIPLE CASE COLOURS
BUT YEAH STICK WITH THE SAME KIND OF KINDA YEAH THE SAME BASIC NON REMOTE KIND OF REMOTE DESIGN
COOL
ALRIGHT SO WE'LL HAVE THE NEXT MEETING ABOUT HALF AN HOUR UM
I WANT THE UH I'D LIKE NATHAN I'D LIKE YOU TO WORK ON JUST THE BASIC LOOK AND FEEL WHAT CAN WE ACCOMPLISH
UM GIVEN THESE PARAMETERS THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA SORT OF HAVE THIS KIND OF UH NON REMOTE REMOTE
UM WHAT ARE OUR BROAD CONSTRAINTS BEFORE WE DEVE DESIGN A PROTOTYPE
AND UM RON IF YOU CAN
FIGURE OUT HOW PROBABLY BEST TO LAY OUT THIS IDEA OF THIS SIMPLE DESIGN WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION BUILT IN AND ALSO THIS KIND OF DROP DOWN OR S ON THE SIDE KIND OF MENU OPTIONS SIMPLE
SOMEHOW WORK OUT HOW WE CAN GET THIS ALL S IN THE SAME PLACE
UM AND IF YOU CAN CHECK PRODUCT EVALUATION WITH M SOME PILOTS AND STUFF
UM I NEED YOU GUYS TO WORK TOGETHER ON MAKING A PROTOTYPE UM USING UM PROTOTYPE BUILDING MATERIALS UM
AND ALSO UM SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR COACHES AS WELL
SO THAT'S WHAT TO START WITH FOR NOW IS THAT ALRIGHT YOU GUYS FEEL CLEAR ABOUT THIS
ALRIGHT
I GUESS WE'LL JUST HIT THE BRICKS
THANKS GUYS
'KAY
I'LL GO FIRST
NO NATHAN'S FINE
IT'S EITHER NATHAN OR PARTICIPANT TWO
UH
OKAY
UM
BASICALLY WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS UM COMPONENT DESIGN AND IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT WE MAY BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED AS TO WHAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE OF WHAT OUR MANUFACTURER OFFERS
SO BASICALLY WHAT I'M GONNA BE DOING IS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THAT
UM COMPONENTS OF A REMOTE CONTROL OKAY
WE'VE ALREADY KIND OF GONE OVER THIS BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET INTO MORE DETAIL AND PROBABLY HAVE TO REACH SOME CONCLUSIONS SOME TIME SOON
ENERGY SOURCE UM OUR MANUFACTURER OFFERS A VARIETY OF ENERGY SOURCES YOUR STANDARD BATTERY SOLAR CELLS
OUR MANUFACTURER DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LITHIUM SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK IF WE DO GO THAT ROUTE WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE
UM AND ALSO THERE'S A KINETIC ENERGY POSSIBILITY
BASICALLY IT'S LIKE A UM THE IDEA OF MOVING THE REMOTE WOULD CREATE ENOUGH ENERGY TO KEEP IT RUNNING
SO THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WOULD BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ILLUMINATE A TOUCH SCREEN
SO WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT
UM THE CASE WE HAVE A FEW OPTIONS PLASTIC RUBBER OR WOOD
UM AND THEN AS FAR AS THE WAY IT'S SHAPED WE CAN DO STANDARD BORING FLAT
WHICH WE PROBABLY DON'T WANNA DO CURVED OR VERY SEXY DOUBLE CURVED
UM I IMAGINE THAT WE COULD SPECIFY
UM I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE CONVENTION OF
THREE OR FOUR MILLIMETRES
YEAH
UM THE BUTTONS THERE ARE MULTIPLE SCROLL BUTTONS AVAILABLE FROM OUR MANUFACTURER
BUT TO USE THOSE WE'D HAVE TO USE MORE CHIPS UM AND THAT WOULD COST US MORE
AND IF WE DO GO WITH THE RUBBER DOUBLED CURVED CASE UM WE'LL HAVE TO USE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS BECAUSE THE OTHER BUTTONS AREN'T COMPATIBLE WITH THAT
UM AND JUST A LITTLE NOTE THERE TOUCH SCREEN EQUALS MANY CHIPS WHICH EQUALS MANY EURO
UM ONE THING THAT I NOTICED WAS THAT MOST REMOTES OPERATE ON A INFRARE ON THE INFRARED PART OF THE SPECTRUM
SO YOU NOTICE WHEN YOU PUSH A BUTTON ON A REMOTE YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING COMING OUT OF IT BUT IN FACT THERE IS LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE REMOTE AND YOU KNOW THE TELEVISION CAN DETECT THAT
AND IF YOU WERE TO RECORD IF YOU WERE TO MAKE A VIDEO RECORDING YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE LIGHT
UH ONE THING THAT I THOUGHT MIGHT BE INTERESTING WAS TO USE PART USE VISIBLE LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE REMOTE JUST KIND OF AS A FUN GIMMICK
SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE SOMETHING COMING OUT OF THE REMOTE WHEN YOU PUSHED IT
COURSE IT'D HAVE TO BE A PART OF THE SPECTRUM THAT WOULDN'T DAMAGE THE HUMAN EYE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
I AM SURE THAT WE COULD DO THAT
UM OF COURSE
YEAH JUST AS A FUN GIMMICK
JUST TO SET US APART A LITTLE BIT
UM AND THEN ON TO THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT WE'RE GONNA USE ALSO KNOWN AS THE CHIP
UH WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY WAY AROUND THE T. A. ONE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE
UM FINDINGS OKAY WE'RE VERY LIMITED BY WHAT OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURERS CAN OFFER
UM AND MY QUESTION TO ALL OF YOU IS SHOULD WE LOOK TO OTHER MANUFACTURIES OR SHOULD WE JUST MAKE DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE
'S A BIT OF A CHALLENGE QUESTION
RIGHT THAT'S MY CONCERN TOO
UM IF WE DO GO THE LITHIUM BATTERY ROUTE THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURER
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS I'LL JUST THROW MY CARDS ON THE TABLE UH I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO THE SOLAR BATTERY ROUTE
JUST TO KINDA KEEP WITH THE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY THEME THAT WE HAVE GOING ON
UH I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE VISIBLE LIGHT SIGNALLING
THAT'S SOMETHING TO SET US APART AND UH I WAS THINKING ABOUT I WAS THINKING OF WAYS THAT WE COULD PRODUCE THE REMOTE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CASE MATERIALS TO SUIT DIFFERENT TASTES
SO WE'RE NOT SO CONFINED BY ONE STYLE AND SAY SOME YOU KNOW
SAY OUR THE ONE IF WE JUST GO WITH ONE AND IT DOESN'T GO OVER WELL THEN WE'RE IN A BAD SITUATION
OH YEAH YOU'RE WELCOME
MM
MM
HMM
I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THIS UM
AS FAR AS THE RUBBER THAT WE CAN USE WE CAN USE A RUBBER AS PART OF THE CASE IT HAS A CONSISTENCY OF THOSE STRESS BALLS
MM
I LIKE THE IDEA OF OF RUBBER TOO BECAUSE IT'S TENDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH BEING DURABLE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DROP AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
'CAUSE SO MANY YOU GO TO SO MANY HOUSES THESE DAYS AND YOU SEE BROKEN REMOTE CONTROLS
TAPED WITH DUCK TAPE AND WHAT HAVE YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM IF YOU USED RUBBER
MM
NO
YEAH
MY ESTIMATE IS THAT IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE TOUCH SCREEN TECHNOLOGY IT'S GONNA COST US UPWARDS OF SEVENTEEN FIFTY EURO PER REMOTE YEAH THAT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE THOUGH
I KNOW
IT'S FUN
I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH THAT
THAT'S JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IT IS PENDING FURTHER EMAILS
RIGHT
IT IS THE NEW IT WOULD BE IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN
IT'S TRUE
WE COULD INITIALLY GO WITH WHAT WE HAVE AND IF WE CAN FIND THEM CHEAPER LATER ON
YEAH
I THINK IF WE WE DO BOTH THE OBVIOUSLY PRODUCTION COSTS ARE GOING TO GO WAY UP UM BUT IT DOES PUT IT INTO IT'D BECOME THE ROLLS ROYCE OF REMOTE CONTROLS BASICALLY
IT WOULD BE VERY NICE
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU YOU JUST UPPING THE NUMBER OF CHIPS THAT YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH EACH DIFFERENT FUNCTION
I WOULD HAVE TO SIDE WITH THAT I THINK THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS SIMPLER
WE ALREADY HAVE THE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY IN HOUSE IT'S READY TO GO IT'S PACKAGED IT'S
UM THIS IS JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD KEEP IN MIND
BUT I THINK THE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD THEY'RE BOTH MM THEY'RE BOTH GONNA PUSH THE COSTS UP
BUT UM
SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY IN HOUSE FOR THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO DO AS MUCH DESIGN WORK AND SOMETIMES THE DESIGN WORK IS WHAT PUSH THE COSTS UP
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
ARE WE GOING TO TALK NOW ABOUT UM THE MATERIALS THAT WE'RE GONNA USE FOR THE CASE AND ALL THOSE THINGS
OKAY
UM THE SOLAR POWER DEFINITELY WOULD BE BUT I THINK JUST TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING ANNOYED
'CAUSE SOMETIMES SOLAR POWER FAILS AND THERE'S NO WAY ROUND THAT WE SHOULD INSTALL A SMALL BACKUP BATTERY
JUST TO COVER THOSE MOMENTS WHEN FOR WHATEVER REASON THE REMOTE HASN'T BEEN EXPOSED TO
IT'S TRUE
YEAH IT WORKS ABOUT THE SAME AS A SOLAR POWERED CALCULATOR AND YOU KNOW HOW THOSE THOSE DON'T REALLY REQUIRE THAT MUCH LIGHT
UM BUT OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE MORE LIGHT THAN A CALCULATOR BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF LIGHT
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE OUT TAKING A SUNBATH FOR A FEW HOURS A DAY OR ANYTHING
HMM
WHY WHY MOVING AWAY FROM HAND HELD WHY
WHAT'S THE UH IDEA
HMM
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE THAT ARE PEOPLE THAT BUY A REMOTE ARE THEY ALWAYS GONNA WANNA USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION OR IS IT JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY DO SOMETIMES
RIGHT
I THINK I THINK YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE NEED TO ESCAPE THE TRADITIONAL SHAPE OF A REMOTE
MAYBE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS NICE ON A TABLE IS WOULD BE GOOD EVEN THOUGH AND HAND HELD THE SAME TIME
YEAH THOSE ARE NICE
MM
OKAY
RIGHT
JUST KIND OF THE SQUISHY FEEL
SORRY ABOUT THE UH LACK OF INFORMATION ON COST I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN PROVIDED THAT INFORMATION BY OUR MANUFACTURERS AND I'M JUST HAVING TO GUESS
RIGHT
IF
IF WE'RE NOT GOING THE TOUCH SCREEN ROUTE THEN WE CAN UM JUST INCORPORATE MAYBE SOMETHING THAT FOLDS OUT LIKE WHAT YOU OFTEN SEE ON THESE KINDS OF REMOTES IS THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS UP HERE AND SOMETHING THAT SLIDES DOWN TO REVEAL THE YOU KNOW MORE COMPLICATED THINGS
YEAH
RIGHT
SO ARE WE GONNA ARE WE TALKING WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF BUTTONS WE'RE GOING TO USE ARE WE GOING TO USE SCROLL BUTTONS
RUBBER BUTTONS
UM
RIGHT
RIGHT
SO HAVE WE DECIDED THAT WE ARE GONNA GO WITH DIFFERENT STYLE CASES FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE
OR ARE WE JUST GOING TO GO WITH ONE
THERE'S AN IDEA
RIGHT
OH EXCELLENT YEAH
THAT SOUNDS GOOD
MISTER PARTICIPANT TWO THAT IS
INTERESTING QUESTION
YES
DID YOU
I LIKE IT I LIKE IT
YES
FABULOUS
WE CAN HAVE A DUCK TAPE CASING
IT COULD GO WITH THE GRANOLA CROWD
PHEW
COMPUTER'S ADJUSTING
ONE MOMENT PLEASE
SO INTERME INTERFACE CONCEPT BY YOUR FAITHFUL USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
SO YUR USER INTERFACE GUYS IS BASICALLY ASPECTS OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT WE CAN SEE OR HEAR OR OTHERWISE UH PERCEIVE
UH COMMANDS AND MECHANISMS THAT BASICALLY USER USES TO CONTROL THE OPERATOR OPERATING SYSTEM
HERE'S A D SERIES OF DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE OUT ON THE MARKET TODAY
I THINK WE'RE DEFINITELY TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THIS KIND OF A LOOK
UM SO
THE FOLLOWING ARE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT UH INTERFACE UH CONCEPTS
UH VOICE RECOGNITION WE WE UM ACTUALLY HAVE SOME NEW UH INFORMATION FROM OUR RESEARCH DESIGN TEAM BUT UH I'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT
UM SO CURRENT VOICE RECOGNITION STARTS UP TO ABOUT EIGHTY SPEECH SAMPLES
UM AND BASICALLY YOU RECORD YOUR OWN VERBAL LABELS C AND CONNECT THEM TO THE REMOTE CONTROL
NOW OUR DESIGN TEAM RESEARCH TEAM
HAS BEEN ABLE TO UH SET UP A SYSTEM IN WHICH UH YOU CAN TEACH THE REMOTE CONTROL VOICE C RECOGNITION SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO UM WITH STANDARD RESPONSES
LIKE YOU COULD SAY GOOD MORNING UH REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'LL SAY IN A SEXY FEMALE VOICE GOOD MORNING JOE
UM
IN FACT WE ALREADY HAVE THIS FOR A COFFEE MAKER LINE
ON THE REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT
UM ANOTHER CONCEPT IS WHAT UH APPLE HAS COME UP WITH
THE SPINNING WHEEL WITH UH L. C. DISPLAY LIKE ON THE UH IPOD WHICH I AM SURE MOST OF YOU KNOW ABOUT
UM AND THEN WE HAVE THE SCROLL BUTTON WITH INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON KIND OF LIKE A MODERN A BIT BULKY
A BIT CRAZY I DON'T THINK THAT'S WE'RE NECESSARILY GOING FOR
AND UH SOME SPECIAL COMPONENTS UH IDEAS LIKE UH BLOCKING
HAVING THE ABILITY TO BLOCK CHANNELS FROM YOUR FOR YOUR CHILDREN UM AND UH DEDICATED BUTTONS FOR FOR COMMONLY USED UH CHANNELS AND EVEN UH IDEAS LIKE SECURED OR HIDDEN PROGRAMMING BUT UH I AGAIN IF WE GO WITH TOUCH SCREEN I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BIG ISSUE
UM
AND UH THIS IS KIND OF THE UH THE BIG DADDY OF REMOTE CONTROLS HERE
UH THE JUMBO UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MISPLACE OR LOSE
UM
AGAIN PROBABLY NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR SO I I MEAN MY IDEAS HERE AND KIND OF WHERE I THINK WE'RE HEADING IS SOMETHING SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN A REGULAR IPOD UH WITH A HARD CLA C UH PLASTIC CASING ALTHOUGH I THINK SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE'VE COME UP WITH ARE DEFINITELY UH VERY GOOD IDEAS
UH CHANGEABLE CASINGS UH OUR DESIGN TEAM WAS POSSIBLY TALKING ABOUT INCLUDING ONE EXTRA FACE PLATE WITH THE PACKAGE TO KIND OF SET THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN CHANGE IT AND YOU CAN TRY CHANGING IT AND KIND OF GET USED TO THINKING ABOUT MAYBE BUYING ANOTHER ONE WHICH CAN ADD VALUE TO OUR UH BOTTOM LINE
UH TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE UM POSSIBLY HAVING GO TO BUTTONS BEING UH STUCK INTO THE SYSTEM SO THOSE DON'T MOVE AWAY FROM THE SCREEN
UH THE IMPORTANT ONES LIKE POWER VOLUME AND JUMP BETWEEN CHANNELS
UM
AND OF COURSE OUR VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM WHICH I'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ALREADY AND UH THE USE OF RECOGNISABLE COLOURS AND SHAPES TO AID RECOGNITION OF THE FEATURES UM THAT ARE AROUND SO
RED FOR POWER UM ARROWS FOR DIFFERENT VOLUME UPS AND DOWNS AND CHANNELS UPS AND DOWNS AND WHAT NOT
AND UH PERHAPS EVEN ADDING IN SOME STUPID LITTLE JOKES WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION IDEA LIKE PERH MM FOR INSTANCE MY TOASTIE MAKER THAT I GOT FROM MY BANK
HAS JOKES WHEN IT'S READY
AND UH THAT IS ABOUT IT
OH YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS THE DAMPERS ON THESE PROJECTS
YOU INDUSTRIAL DESIGNERS
WHERE DO YOU GUYS COME UP WITH THESE NUMBERS
I'M THINKING THAT'S UH DEFINITELY A GOOD IDEA AND I ALSO THINK THAT WE COULD PROBABLY COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF A CHEAPER UH MEANS TO TO GO ABOUT THIS KIND OF PRODUCTION
MY MY TEAM IN THE UH ON THE THIRD FLOOR SUGGESTED THAT UH
YEAH
I MEAN I THINK THAT WE REALLY HAVE TWO MAIN SELLING POINTS I THINK THAT OUR CASING AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION
TO BE HONEST WE HAVE THE CAPA WE HAVE THE DESIGN IN HOUSE
I MEAN WE'VE WE'VE COME UP WITH THIS WITH THIS NEW VOICE WE'RE USING IT FOR OUR COFFEE MACHINES ALREADY
I CAN PASS YOU ON THAT EMAIL FROM MY UH GUY IN UH GUY DOWN THE HALL
SOUNDS GOOD
I MEAN WE WE HAVE TO R REFLECT BACK ON WHAT OUR MARKET RESEARCH DID SAY
DOES HAVING BOTH REALLY UP OUR COSTS
WELL MY P IS
UM I DEFINITELY HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT LAST COMMENT
IT'S YOU AND ME OUTSIDE A LITTLE HERE
CALCULATOR
I'M WILLING TO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID
UH I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH THAT UM ANOTHER IDEA'S COME UP IN MY HEAD
IF WE'RE REALLY NOT UH HANDLING THE REMOTE CONTROL TO A GREAT EXTENT WE COULD POSSIBLY GET AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF HAVING A HAND HELD REMOTE CONTROL AND MAYBE KIND OF HAVE A ROUND REMOTE CONTROL THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A PAPERWEIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
KIND OF A SLEEK LITTLE UH NEAT THING THAT SITS ON YOUR TABLE OR SOMETHING
JUST A THOUGHT
WELL IF YOU DON'T NEED TO PICK IT UP IT COULD KIND OF BE A SELLING POINT
I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT FOLLOWING APPLE'S LEAD ON A LOT OF THESE THINGS
MM-HMM
EXACTLY
THINK THEN WE'RE HITTING OUR COST ISSUE AGAIN
I THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WE HAVE TO STICK WITH UH KIND OF UH A LITTLE BIT TRADITIONAL IN TERMS OF THE BUTTONS AND THEN AND THEN MAKE OUR UNIQUE FEATURE OUR CASING AND WHAT NOT AND OUR VOICE COMMAND
WELL WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY DOING
WHAT WERE
SURE
AND AGAIN COPYING IMAC'S KIND OF FOR IPOD MAC APPLE'S UH COLOUR SCHEME
FABULOUS
THAT WENT WELL THANK YOU
PERFECT
GO AHEAD
NICE
MM
RIGHT
RIGHT
NICE
INTERESTING
MM
GOOD CALL
CHOOSE IT
WELL I'D SAY SHOP AROUND BUT WITH OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS IS THAT REALLY A FEASIBLE OPTION
RIGHT
RIGHT
UM
IT'S AN OPTION
UH BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S I'VE GOT SOME RESEARCH ALREADY ON LIKE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND TRENDS IN CASING RIGHT NOW WHICH ACTUALLY MIGHT EVEN COME INTO PLAY BEFOREHAND
IT MAY HELP US DECIDE FOR NOW
TEMPORARILY ANYWAY
I GUESS SO 'CAUSE I FOUND SOME INTERESTING THINGS
YOU WAITING FOR ME
I KNOW WHAT A TEASER AIN'T IT
UM
RIGHT
SO CURRENT MARKET TRENDS
SCREEN
UM BASICALLY I WAS LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET RIGHT NOW AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN OTHER DESIGN FIELDS
TO SEE SORT OF WHAT'S WHAT'S TRENDY WHAT'S NEW WHAT'S HAPPENING
UM REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT NOW BASICALLY EVERYBODY SAYS THEY WANT NEWER FANCIER MORE EXCITING THEY'RE SICK OF THIS BORING
NORMAL FUNCTIONAL UM THAT WE NEED INNOVATIVE DESIGN OPTIONS AND THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EASY USER INTERFACE
UM THE CHALLENGE IS THAT CURRENT TRENDS RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE BOARD IN FASHION IN FURNITURE
IN TECHNOLOGY IS A VERY ORGANIC FRUIT AND VEGETABLE KIND OF THING
NOW I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW TOMATO SHAPED REMOTE CONTROLS OR ANYTHING
BUT I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE MAYBE TO USE UM NATURAL COLOURS LIKE IF WOOD IS AN OPTION THAT WHOLE ORGANIC SLEEK CLEAN
V LINE THING MAY BE SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO
DIFFERENT SKIN OPTIONS OR IF WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS TOUCH PLATE THING OR TOUCH FACE SCREEN INTERFACE UM
MAYBE HAVING THE B IMAGES BE SPECIFIC LIKE YOU COULD CHOOSE YOUR MENU BULLETS TO BE
A DIFFERENT SHAPE OR OKAY NOT THE EXAMPLE I WOULD CHOOSE
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN TO T SORT OF AND TH APPARENTLY THE FEEL OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IS SPONGY
UH NOT SOMETHING I I'VE COME UP WITH A THOUGH IF WE CAN GET AROUND TO GETTING PILOTING I THOUGHT MAYBE A CASING OPTION LIKE UH
NOT LIKE A SKIN BUT LIKE A HOLDER ALMOST IF YOU COULD DO LIKE UM LEATHER OPTIONS OR WOOD OPTIONS OR SOMETHING
MM-HMM
MM
MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING WAY TO GO
UM YEAH SO SOMETHING TO SIT ON FOR NOW
SO OVERALL I THINK WE SHOULD STICK WITH WHAT WE'RE FINDING EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR EASY TO USE
TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND THIS FANCY NEW I THINK PERHAPS THE DOUBLE CURVE THING AND MAYBE THIS RUBBER OPTION IS OUR BEST WAY TO GO FOR RIGHT NOW
UM
YEAH
UM
WELL I D BUT THEN IF THE TOUCH SCREEN THING ISN'T GONNA WORK OUT FOR US THAT'S REALLY A NON ISSUE
TRUE
VERY TRUE
VERY TRUE
VERY MUCH SO
UM
WE COULD
I THINK THAT GOES AGAINST THE WHOLE FANCY SOMETHING A NEW LINE BUT WORTH A SHOT
AH IT COULD BE IT COULD BE UM
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I KNOW
NO PROBLEM
MM
YEAH
VERY TRUE VERY TRUE
MM
HMM
OKAY
MM RIGHT
MM
NICE
MM
MM
I THINK IT'S OUR MOST MARKETABLE FEATURE JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO NEW AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS SHOWING UP IN OTHER PLACES
BUT CAN WE REALLY AFFORD IT 'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE A REALLY MAIN COST SOURCE THEN RIGHT
PER
PIECE
I KNOW
AND OUR GOAL WAS TO BE UNDER TWELVE FIFTY OR WE HAVE TO BE UNDER TWELVE FIFTY
DO WE REMEMBER
OKAY
CAN WE JUSTIFY IT
RIGHT
THOUGH I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY FOR I MEAN IF YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR AN EXPENSIVE HIGH CLASS REMOTE YOU'RE GONNA EXPECT IT TO DO SOMETHING
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
SEE IF WE CAN CUT SOME CORNERS
RIGHT
WELL AND WE CAN LOOK INTO THIS OTHER MANUFACTURING OPTION AND MAYBE WE CAN GET 'EM SOMEWHERE ELSE CHEAPER
RIGHT
IT'S A STARTING POINT ANYWAY SO
MM
YEAH 'CAUSE WITH VOICE RECOGNITION
I MEAN REALLY THIS IS PRETTY BELLS AND WHISTLES KINDA REMOTE
I THINK WE'D HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN 'EM DEFINITELY
PRICE WISE
TRUE
WE'VE ALREADY GOT IT
PRETTY MUCH
RIGHT AND THEY SAID THEY WANTED VOICE RECOGNITION
COURSE MAYBE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OF THIS WHOLE TOUCH SCREEN OPTION
BUT DEFINITELY WE KNOW THE MARKET IS THERE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION SO TO SAY WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND WE'RE NOT GONNA USE IT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT'LL SELL
IS A CALL I DON'T THINK I CAN GIVE THE HIGHS UPS
LIKE REALLY I CAN'T GO IN AND SAY NO WE'RE GONNA JUST IGNORE EVERYTHING WE KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
WELL WE ALREADY HAVE RESEARCH BACKING VOICE RECOGNITION AS YOU KNOW
FISCALLY SOLVENT
BUT UH I I I PERSONALLY WOULD TEND TO ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT IF THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA SELL I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GO WITH AND MAYBE WE CAN TABLE THIS TOUCH SCREEN FOR OUR NEXT MODEL
MM
RIGHT
RIGHT
AND WE'RE STILL NOT THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS BATTERY ISSUE NEARLY AS MUCH EITHER WE CAN STICK WITH WHAT WE'VE ALREADY GOT
IN A LOT OTHER WAYS TOO
I THINK IT'S OUR LOWER RISK OPTION WHICH FOR RIGHT NOW WE CAN HAVE IT ON THE MARKET SOONER WHICH IS ALL IN ALL OUR BEST OPTION
SO AND WHEN ARE WE GONNA HAVE BASIC PROTOTYPES COMING UP NEXT THAT'S YOU GUYS'S NEXT STEP RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL WHAT OF PEOPLE WITH LIKE THE T. V. IN THEIR BASEMENT LIKE WHAT IF WHA WE CAN'T GUARANTEE SUNLIGHT EVERYWHERE SO HAVING A SECONDARY SOURCE IS PROBABLY
YEAH
TRUE
TRUE
RIGHT
OKAY
UH
INTERESTING
I IF IT'S GOT VOICE RECOGNITION IT CAN BE TECHNICALLY ANYWHERE IN YOUR ROOM AND STILL DO ITS JOB
TRUE AND I PROBABL I THINK WE'RE BANKING ON SELLING IT TO MORE THAN JUST VOICE RECOGNITION PEOPLE
LIKE WE WANT IT TO WORK FUNDAMENTALLY AS A BASIC MANUAL TOO RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEP
YEAH
WITH THE BU YEAH
MM-HMM
TRUE
WAY TO GO
YEAH I'M THINKING OF THE AIRPORT PORTAL YOU KNOW LIKE THAT LITTLE POD LOOKING THING
RIGHT
THAT WOULD BE KINDA NEAT
TERRACOTTA BOWL OR SOMETHING
MM
MM
YEAH
YEAH WHICH IS THE NEXT BIG THING SO THAT'S NOT GONNA HURT US EITHER
RIGHT
HANDY
OKAY
MM
RIGHT
WELL WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE ONLY USING THE MOST PRIMARY FUNCTIONS ON A DAILY BASIS
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD COMPLETELY RULE OUT MAJOR FUNCTIONS THEY SHOULD BE SECONDARY AT LEAST IF NOT FUNCTIONALLY THEN VISUALLY LIKE THOSE SHOULDN'T BE
TAKE PRECEDENCE YEAH
RIGHT
AND THEY SLIDE
WELL AND DO WE WANNA CONSIDER LIKE AN IPOD SCREEN WHICH ISN'T A TOUCH SCREEN BUT YOU'RE STILL SCROLLING THROUGH MENU OPTIONS IN P
TRUE WE'RE STILL NOT MAKING IT EASIER THEN
TRUE
FAIR ENOUGH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S JUST A SCROLL
YEAH
YEAH
PROBABLY
RIGHT
MM
WELL NO IT'S BASIC JUST LIKE FOUR DIRECTIONS THAT ARE THAT CAN USE AS MENU OR CHANNEL AND VOLUME OR HOWEVER YOU WANNA DO IT
ARE REALLY VERSATILE AND EVERYBODY'S ALREADY GOT THEM TO SOME EXTENT ON THE REMOTES THEY ALREADY OWN SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE DEALING WITH EVERYBODY RELEARNING THINGS 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING ANYBODY'S GONNA WANNA BUY A NEW FOR
MM
RIGHT PARTICULARLY IN TECHNOLOGICAL FIELDS SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE HEADED
UH
OH IT WASN'T IN THE WAY BUT YEAH WHATEVER
NO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
MM
YEAH
YEAH GET IN THERE
YEAH TOTALLY
COOL
COOL
ALL SET
COOL
ALRIGHT IT IS POWERPOINT TIME
I'VE DONE MORE POWERPOINTS IN THIS PARTICULAR EXPERIMENT THAN I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE BEFORE THIS EXPERIMENT WHICH IS KIND OF FUN
SO UH HERE WE HAVE OUR DETAILED DESIGN MEETING WHERE WE WILL UM LOOK AT THE PROTOTYPE AND UM RIGHT SO UM
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT THIS WHOLE SECOND BULLET POINT IS ABOUT IN MY THAT MY COACH WAS SENDING TO ME
IT MEANS I'M SUPPOSED TO READ THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING
I THINK
I DON'T KNOW
OTHERWISE IT'S JUST SAYING I'M THE SECRETARY AND I'M THEREFORE I'M TAKING THE MINUTES
S SO JUST TO GO UM JUST REAL BRIEFLY TO GO OVER MINUTES FROM LAST MEETING
UH I WILL OPEN THEM SLOWLY NO
WAIT FOR IT WAIT FOR IT
NO
THAT'S HOW THE
WAIT
THIS IS THIS IS VERY HIGH POWERED STUFF HERE DOUBLE CLICKING THERE WE GO
SO UM BASICALLY THE MORAL OF THE STORY FROM OUR LAST MINUTE UH LAST MEETING WAS THAT UM WE THAT WE HAD MEETINGS FROM UH WE HAD PRESENTATIONS DONE BY THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
UH OR FROM NATHAN AND RON AND FROM SARAH ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO HERE UM AND WHAT
SORT OF LIMITATIONS WE'RE OPERATING WITH UM UH EXCUSE ME WHAT LIMITATIONS WE'RE OPERATING UNDER
WHAT KIND OF RISK WE'D BE LOOKING AT WITH SOME OF THE VARIOUS APPROACHES WE WERE DISCUSSING AND WE ESSENTIALLY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WE SHOULD DEVELOP A REMOTE WITH UH VOICE RECOGNITION
I. E. THAT HAD A VAGUELY NON REMOTE LIKE SHAPE UM BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO USE IT AS A REMOTE SINCE YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR VOICE
THAT WOULD INCLUDE SOME MOSTLY JUST THE SIMPLE DESIGN FEATURES FOR A TELEVISION OPERATION BUT WITH A SLIDE OR A FOLD OUT BAY FOR MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS FOR USERS
UM AND UH THE UH UH THE U. I. D. AND THE I. D. WERE ASKED TO GO AHEAD AND START DEVELOPING A PROTOTYPE FOR US TO LOOK AT
SO
THAT'S SORTED BACK TO THE MAIN
MEET HERE UM GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT AWAY GUYS
MM-HMM
NICE
PERFECT
OH RIGHT
OH WELL DONE YEAH YEAH OH OK
EDIBLE TELEVISIONS IT'S A WAVE OF THE FUTURE
BRILLIANT
BRILLIANT
COOL
NO NO I THINK THAT'S
RIGHT YEAH THANKS GUYS THAT'S VERY VERY GOOD WORK
I LIKE IT BRILLIANT
UM WHAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS NOW IS THE FINANCE OF IT UM I GOT ME YOU'VE GOT YOU PROVIDED A NUMBER THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS QUITE NICE
UM THE TROUBLE IS I WAS JUST GIVEN THIS BY FINANCE
UM IT'S A SPREADSHEET OF THE PARTS AND I'VE JUST TENTATIVELY PUT IN WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE UM
I'M JUST GONNA CLEAR THIS OUT REAL QUICKLY BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
SO WE'LL JUST IF WE CAN JUST ITEMIZE WHAT'S IN HERE WE'VE GOT THIS IT'S A SOLAR CELL THING RIGHT
WITH A BACK UP BATTERY
WITH THE BA OKAY
UM AND
CLEVER CLEVER WELL DONE
UM SO I GUESS THAT WOULD MEAN WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A UM
IT'S A S A SPEAKER AND A SENSOR AT THE SAME TIME ISN'T IT
OKAY
UM AND THE CASE IT'S MORE OF A SINGLE CURVED CASE I GUESS WOULD BE THAT BE THE GENERAL
UM AND WE'VE GOT A RUBBER SKIN MATERIAL BASICALLY THROUGHOUT
UM
PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE
UM WITH THIS OTHER DROP DOWN SO MAYBE WE'VE GOT TWO PUSH BUTTON INTERFACES DON'T WE
UM
AND UM A SPECIAL
I GUESS IT'S UH WE'VE GOT A SORT OF A WOOD MATERI A RUBBERY TYPE MATERIAL THAT THROUGHOUT YEAH
YEAH IT'S IT'S QUITE UNIQUE
I LIKE IT YEAH IT'S
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
A BIT OVER BUDGET UM
SO WHAT WE COULD DO PERHAPS A SIMPLE FIX WOULD MAYBE TO SWITCH AWAY FROM THE SOLAR CELLS
UM OR TAKE OUT THE BACK UP BATTERY
UH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
WHAT'S DIFFICULT WE HAVE ALL THESE THINGS INTEGRAL TO THE UM TO THE DESIGN OF IT THAT WE JUST CAN'T BACK OUT OF NOW
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SEEMS LIKE WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK TO
SQUARE ONE
IN A WAY
UM IF WE WERE GONNA TRY TO UNDO ONE BIT WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO UNDO MOST OF IT UM
IT'S EITHER OR
'CAUSE WE CAN'T REMOVE THE PUSH BUTTONS 'CAUSE THEY'RE UM AND WE CAN'T GET RID OF THE UH I MEAN REMOVING THE CHANGING THE CASE WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH OF A
MM MM UM NOR WOULD CHANGING THE CASE MATERIALS
UM
SO YEAH THAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE THE ONLY THING
SO THAT WOULD BE THE IT'S A MAJOR CHANGE BUT
YEAH
ALRIGHT SO WE'RE IN AGREEMENT ON THAT
RIGHT
MOVING ALONG SWIFTLY
UM SO I GUESS NOW WE JUST GO TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION
WHICH I WILL ALLOW SARAH TO TAKE OVER
AH OF COURSE SORRY
WHOOSH
THAT'D BE GREAT
BRILLIANT
HMM
UM YEAH I WAS JUST GO ON
WELL THEY DON'T OWN TELLYS ANYWAY DO THEY
RIGHT
SO UM THIS ONE'S A BIT UNCLEAR TO ME TO BE PERFECTLY FAIR UM
I GOT THIS SLIDE FROM THE COACH AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CONNECTED TO
UM SO I GUESS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS UM OUR PROJECT PROCESS UM AND THAT IS GONNA GO INTO MY REPORT
SO I GUESS THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE GO UM UH OUT OF ROLE IT LOOKS LIKE AND TALK ABOUT OUR SATISFACTION FOR ROOM FOR CREATIVITY AND SO FORTH AND HOW THAT ALL WORKED
I GUESS UM
I THINK SO YEAH
I THINK IT'S
I MM-HMM I THINK SO
I THINK HOPE I'M NOT SCREWING UP AN EXPERIMENT
BUT I TRUST THAT SHE WOULD JUMP IN IF I WAS SO OKAY FAIR ENOUGH
UM RIGHT UM SO ANY THOUGHTS
YEAH
WHAT DO YOU GUYS FEEL ABOUT THE PROCESS
MM-HMM
NO NO WHITEBOARD
WAS PRETTY COOL TACK THOUGH
ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT COACH INEFFECTIVE
VERY NATURAL LOOK
THAT'S THE BRILLIANCE OF THEY HAD A P THEY HAD A PEELER IN HERE
YEAH I THINK YEAH RE I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE REALLY CREATIVE ACTUALLY I MEAN
INCLUDING THE S THE MULTI COLOURED WAVE PATTERN
WHAT DID YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THE THE THE ROLES
THAT'S TRUE I I GOT THIS SPREADSHEET
OF WHAT TO DO
MM MM
COOL
SHE SAID I I I SHE ACTUALLY MADE A COMMENT OFF BOY YOU'RE GETTING INTO THIS AND I REALLY I THINK IT'S TRUE I DID GET I I FELT LIKE I GOT WAY TOO INTO IT
I FELT LIKE I SLIPPED INTO IT A LOT
I DUNNO
THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE YEAH PROJECT PROJECT MANAGEMENT
I USUALLY ORGANISE CRAP IT'S ONE THING TO DO YOU KNOW SET UP A PARTY WITH YOUR FRIENDS YOU KNOW
BUT YOU GUYS FELT THAT YOU COULD KEEP THE YEAH SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF KIND OF LIKE LIKE THE ROLE AND THE OKAY
YEAH YEAH
MAYBE IN IN LEGOS YOU KNOW
BE FUN WITH LEGOS TOO LIKE MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL OR SPACESHIP
WE USED TO HAVE SPACESHIP LEGOS DID YOU GUYS EVER USED TO BUILD SPACESHIPS WITH LEGOS EVERYBODY KNOWS BEST SPACESHIPS EVER
UM YOU GUYS FELT LIKE THERE WAS ENOUGH TEAMWORK IN ALL
HMM
NO I NO I DUNNO I D I I DUNNO I DON'T I I WAS JUST I
IT'S TRUE HUH
YEAH
YEAH
COURSE I'M I'M CONSCIOUS OF THE IDEA OF THE PROJECT MANAGER ASKING IF YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE THERE'S A TEAM YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE
KIND OF LIKE LIKE HMM
IT D
BUT YEAH
INTERESTING
IT'S KIND OF FASCINATING WASN'T IT
I MEAN THE WHOLE PROCESS OF
I DON'T KNOW
I I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A RI I TH
MM
NOR I
I WANNA SEE THE OUTPUT FILES FROM THESE UM FROM THE DIGITAL PAPER
I WANNA SEE WH WH WHAT MY MY HANDWRITING LOOKS LIKE DIGITIZED BECAUSE MY HANDWRITING IS CRAP
I MEAN JUST TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN P. D. F. FORMAT OR SOMETHING
T I I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THE DE BRIEFING IS GONNA BE LIKE
YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT IS THE UH
WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE
I DUNNO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE NEW IDEAS FOUND I IS ABOUT
WELL THAT'S THE THING I GOT I IN THE EMAIL I GOT THIS POWERPOINT FILE BUT THIS SLIDE WAS JUST THERE MM-HMM
I DIDN'T CHANGE THIS ONE AT ALL
UM CH
YEAH WELL
W I KINDA LIKE TH
YEAH YOU CAN'T
YEAH
DOES KINDA MAKE YOU WONDER I MEAN HOW MUCH CAN YOU DO WITH A REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S LIKE INVENTING A NEW CAR
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN
YEAH
HMM
UM
'KAY
SO THIS WAS OTHER COSTS
I DUNNO
I THINK THIS IS
FORTY ISH I I I MM WE SHOULD GO ON A BIT YEAH ABOUT THE PROJECT EVAL UM
I DUNNO ABOUT YOU GUYS BUT I FELT LIKE
A BIT
UNDER STIMULATED ON THE WHOLE THING
LIKE WHAT LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT AM I REALLY DOING YOU KNOW WHAT IS
YEP
HEY
MM
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T DO THAT AT ALL THOUGH EVERY SINGLE ONE I A ALL THE PRESENTATIONS I EITHER ADDED SLIDES OR EDITED 'EM
I DI
OH
WHAT
REALLY
DID THEY NOT HAVE THEY DIDN'T LIKE UH MINE YEAH THEY DIDN'T COME LIKE THIS
LIKE WITH THIS WAS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS IS WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE LITERALLY JUST LIKE THAT
INTERESTING
UH-HUH HUH-HUH
INTERESTING
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS COME TO MIND
YEAH BUT
BUILDS
MM
INTERESTING
UH YEAH I'D SAY SO
MM I KNOW
IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING FLOWED PRETTY LOGICALLY
YOU KNOW FROM THE THE THE BASICS TO THE CONCE ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE CONCEPTS THING THE WHOLE CONCEPTS PHASE I DON'T THINK I REALLY UNDERSTOOD LIKE THE CONCEPT
WELL THE ID OKAY THE NOTION OF YEAH I MEAN I IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE A CONCEPT OF A MUG'S MATERIAL IT'S JUST IT IS WHAT IT IS
YOU KNOW
MAYBE I RATHER THAN CONCEPTS I IT SHOULD BE TH THOUGHT OF WE SH I I THOUGHT OF I THOUGHT OF RATHER THAN IN TERMS OF CONCEPTS I THOUGHT OF IT IN TERMS OF UM LIKE
PROPOSED IDEA
AND THEN THE FINAL WOULD BE LIKE TH THE ACTUAL SPECIFIED PROTOTYPE OR WHATEVER I DUNNO
BUT
ALL IN ALL IT'S KINDA INTERESTING
NO JUST THIS CLOSING ONE
NO WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT THE COSTS WEREN'T REALLY WITHIN BUDGET BUT WE COULD S YOU KNOW DO IT
WE DID THE PROJECT EVALUATION BASED ON UM SARAH'S EVALUATION OF ON OFF SWITCHES AND
MM
TRUE
YEAH
'CAUSE WE DI WE HAD A THU THINK ABOUT IT
UM
YEAH
AND IT'S ALL RECORDED WOO HOO
YEAH WHAT I'M GONNA I'M GONNA PUT UM I'M SUPPOSED TO DO THIS FINAL REPORT THING AT THE END SO I'LL PUT ALL THAT INTO THE FINAL REPORT AS WELL
OR AS MUCH AS SEEMS LIKE MAYBE NOT LIKE THE ARTICLES AND STUFF
LIKE BECAUSE AND IF AND SO FORTH BUT I'LL PUT MOST OF IT IN THE REPORTS
NICE
OH YEAH
THERE'S A WHOLE BRANCH OF PSYCHOLOGY THAT LOOKS INTO THAT PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
YEP THEY'RE CALLED UM DISFLUENCIES
YEAH WE LIKE OUR FANCY PHRASES AND TERMINOLOGIES FOR THINGS
EXACTLY UH I WILL SAVE THIS INTO THE
PROJECT DOCUMENTS
YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH I KNOW
COME ON GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION
WELL TO BE FAIR WE'RE WE'RE HOOKED WE'RE ALL HOOKED ON THE INTERNET SO I MEAN I DO THE
I KNOW IMAGINE WE WENT THE FIRST TEN Y FIFTEEN YEARS OF OUR LIVES WITHOUT THE INTERNET
IT'S ONLY IN THE LAST TEN THAT WE'RE LIKE WHERE'S THE INTERNET
I MEAN YOU KNOW IT JUST IN THE PAST FIVE WE'VE GONE FROM TWENTY EIGHT EIGHT MODEMS TO BROADBAND ALL THE TIME
NO WE HAVE BUT I NOT IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S SO UN YOU KNOW UH UBIQUITOUS
MM
YEAH THAT'S OUR LAST STEP
CELEBRATION
'KAY I GUESS WE CAN PROBABLY CALL THAT MEETING TO AN END FOR THE MOST PART
COOL
WHERE DO YOU FIND THAT
IS THIS ONE OF THOSE MEDIA PLAYER
W OH
THE DEFAULT TRACK
I THOUGHT IT WAS DAVID BURNS LOOK INTO THE EYEBALL
THAT'S ONE THAT SEEMS TO BE SHIPPING WITH IT UH SHIPPED WITH FOR A WHILE MAYBE THIS IS THE NEW VERSION
YEAH I GUESS WE'LL CALL THAT A A DONER
FAB
YEAH
OH REALLY
OKAY
WELL
UH WE HAVE ASSEMBLED OUR PROTOTYPE UM
WHAT'S TO BE SAID ABOUT IT
UM WE TOOK INTO ACCOUNT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE WENT OVER IN THE LAST MEETING UM
SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO CONSIDER ARE THAT WE DECIDED NOT TO GO FOR THE TOUCH SCREEN WHICH YOU CAN SEE AND OPTED FOR SOME VERY LARGE BUTTONS FOR THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS
UM
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE ON OFF BUTTON AND WE HAVE THESE BUTTONS TO GO THROUGH THE CHANNELS UM AND THEN TWO VOLUME BUTTONS DOWN HERE
D UH WE DECIDED THOSE WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT UH BUTTONS
AND THEN FOR THE MORE ADVANCED UH FUNCTIONS THERE IS A SLIDE OUT PANEL HERE UM AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS GOING ON
BUT THIS ACTUALLY CAN SLIDE BACK IN AND PROVIDES A VERY NICE AESTHETIC WHEN IT'S ALL PUT AWAY UM
AS FAR AS THE UH WHOLE VISIBLE LIGHT THING WE DECIDED TO GO WITH THE MULTIPLE COLOURS COMING OUT WHY NOT
OF COURSE IF THAT'S ANNOYING FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT FUNCTION CAN BE TURNED OFF
UM
GO AHEAD
THAT'S THIS HERE
UM I WORRIED ABOUT THE MATERIALS IT IS UH THE ENTIRE THING IS COVERED IN A RUBBER COATING SO IT'S VERY DURABLE UH
IT'S NOT GONNA BREAK LIKE SOME TYPES OF PLASTIC THAT'S DROPPED
UM AND OF COURSE AS YOU CAN SEE AND IF YOU TOUCH IT IT DOES HAVE THAT NICE SQUISHY FEEL
FACT I DUNNO IF YOU NOTICED BUT I WROTE THE UH THE COMPANY'S NAME ON THE TELEPHONE SCREEN I THOUGHT THAT WAS KINDA NICE
THIS WAS ACTUALLY AN APPLE ON THE INSIDE
THIS
YEAH
WE GOT A BIT AHEAD OF OURSELVES I KNOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MAKING TELEVISIONS AT THIS POINT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT
RIGHT
UH WE DID YEAH
THIS COST WELL TO PUT THIS INTO UM PRODUCTION WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT WHAT WAS OUR GOAL
IT WAS TWELVE FIFTY EURO UM AND THIS ACTUALLY CAME IN AT ABOUT ELEVEN NINETY NINE
UM SO I WAS QUITE PLEASED WITH THAT
ONE THING THAT WE DIDN'T DO UM OBVIOUSLY WE HAD A CHOICE WITH THE BUTTONS WHETHER TO USE SCROLL BUTTONS OR STANDARD RUBBER BUTTONS
BUT WE JUST WENT FOR A CLASSIC RUBBER BUTTON AND UM SINCE WE DID THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO USE AS MANY MICROCHIPS WHICH WAS QUITE NICE AND THAT'S WHAT HELPED KEEP THE COST DOWN
SO EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A LOT OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY UM FOR EXAMPLE THE VOICE RECOGNITION
IN A LOT OF WAYS IT'S JUST A SIMPLE REMOTE AND UM I THINK IF WE SHOPPED AROUND FOR OTHER MANUFACTURERS UM WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET EVEN CHEAPER
AND
OH NO WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT YET HAVE WE
HMM
YEAH
ANY QUESTIONS
UM DO YOU WANNA ANSWER THIS ONE OR DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER IT
YEAH YEAH
UM WELL AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS JUST A MOST SUPERFICIAL LAYER AND UM IT'D BE VERY EASY TO PUT ANOTHER LAYER OF SOMETHING ELSE LIKE
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT QUITE A A FACE PLATE
IT'S MORE LIKE A PSEUDO FACE PLATE BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH THAT IN THE FACTORY IT COULD WE COULD VERY EASILY PUT A DIFFERENT ONE ON IT
IT LOCKS INTO PLACE SUCH THAT YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY PERMANENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME
IF WE WANNA GO THE OTHER WAY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF A COUPLE OF ADJUSTMENTS AND WE COULD GO THE FACE PLATE WAY IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
OH
OOH
RIGHT UH WE DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH ON THAT BUT IT IT'S IN THERE YEP
YEAH YEAH
IT'S JUST MAKING USE OF THE SAME SPACE AND THE SAME MATERIALS BUT
YEAH ONE BIG CURVE I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
YEAH MM-HMM
YEAH SPECIAL
AND S I GUESS YOU HAVE TO MARK SPECIAL COLOUR AND SPECIAL FORM AS WELL DON'T YOU
'CAUSE IT I IT IS VERY UNCONVENTIONAL I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS UNCONVENTIONAL
OH
HUH DOESN'T MATCH UP DOES IT
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT
I MEAN WE COULD TAKE WE COULD TAKE THE BATTERY OUT OF IT YOU SEE AND IT'D PROBABLY WORK NINETY NINE PER CENT OF THE TIME BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SET UP A CALL CENTRE FOR THAT ONE PER CENT OF THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE CALLING AND SAYING OH LOOK MY REMOTE ISN'T WORKING WHAT AM I GONNA DO
PEOPLE'D BE REAL UPSET
I THINK IN THE LONG RUN IT'S BETTER TO KEEP THE BATTERY
IT'S HARD TO SCRAP THE WHOLE CELL BATTERY IDEA 'CAUSE THAT'S SO INTEGRAL TO THE THEME THAT WE HAVE
YEAH
HMM
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH
I GUESS WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO THAT
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET BELOW OUR UH GOAL ISN'T IT
OF TWELVE FIFTY
YEAH
GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO
MM
REALLY GOOD
SIX
WE DID
I AM BIT DISAPPOINTED ABOUT LOSING THE SOLAR PANEL BUT IT'S OKAY
MM
I KNOW
TRUE
OKAY
RIGHT SO IT'S JUST KIND OF A OPEN MIC KIND OF THING OR
'KAY
YEAH
ARE WE CONSIDERING THESE POINTS HERE
OKAY
NO
YEAH IT'S TRUE
MM
DEFINITELY
AS YOU WRITE YOUR PERSONAL COACH
WHAT IF YOU GET A RESPONSE TWO OR THREE MONTHS FROM NOW
THAT'D BE WEIRD
YEAH
THAT'S VERY NATURAL
YEAH
AND TO PROVE THAT WE WEREN'T WASTEFUL WE DIDN'T WASTE A SINGLE BIT OF PLAY DOH WE USED EVERY BIT
YEAH I GUESS
MY ONE MY ONE CRITICISM IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH COLOURS TO WORK WITH WE ONLY HAD FOUR WASN'T ENOUGH
I KNOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN AMAZING
HMM
YEAH IT'S F KIND OF FUN IT WAS
I THINK IT WAS PRETTY CLEVER 'CAUSE WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO GET TOO FAR OFF TRACK BECAUSE THE INFORMATION CAME IN AT THE RIGHT TIME AND KIND OF FILLED IN THE GAPS ENOUGH
AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAD ENOUGH ROOM TO KIND OF JUST MAKE THINGS UP WHICH WAS KIND OF FUN
YEAH
MM
YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
THAT WAS FUN
I THINK THE MOST HELPFUL THING OUT OF EVERYTHING WAS GETTING THE THE POWERPOINT SLIDES ALREADY PUT TOGETHER FOR YOU 'CAUSE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD HAVE GOT ALL THAT DONE IN TIME
IT WAS REALLY GOOD YEAH
IT'S KINDA FUN
YEAH
LITTLE DIFFERENT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU DON'T
YEAH
YEAH
WONDER WHY IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE GOT SO MUCH INFORM WHAT WAS IT THAT KEPT US FROM GOING TO THE THE BOARD
YEAH THAT'S IT 'CAUSE THE MICS ARE LOOSE AND EACH TIME YOU GET UP IT'S S A POSSIBILITY OF TRIPPING OVER SOMETHING OR GETTING TANGLED OR
YEAH THAT'S IT
USUALLY I WOULD DO A LOT MORE DOODLING TOO BUT I DIDN'T BECAUSE
NEW IDEAS
HMM
I GUESS WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
NO NONE
I THINK THEY'RE FINE ACTUALLY
YEAH MAYBE A S A CIRCLE WOULD BE ALRIGHT DIFFERENT
ARE WE BACK INTO PROJECT MOOD
YEAH
YEAH
DEFINITELY WHEN WHEN I FIRST FILLED OUT THE QUESTIONNAIRE I WAS MARKING IT PROBABLY HIGHER IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH I HAD TO HOW MUCH I STRESSED OVER IT AND THEN BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE LAST ONE I WAS LIKE
YOU KNOW NOT VERY MUCH
YEAH
MM-HMM
DID YOU REALLY
I JUST GOT BLANK ONES AND
ME TOO
I DELETED SLIDES
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL IT WAS A HIGH MOMENT OF THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT
I THINK IT WOULD FAIL I THINK
IT'D BE A HUGE DISASTER ESPECIALLY IF IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
I DON'T WE KIND OF DESIGNED IT TO LOOK LITTLE BIT LIKE A FACE
IT'S A HAPPY FACE
YEAH IT'S UH
I WANNA SEE A
YEAH
HMM
SO WE HAVE MORE SLIDES OR
MM
HMM
I
IT'D BE SO COOL IF WE GET A COPY OF THE RECORDING
REALLY
FILLER WORDS OR
DISFLUENCIES
I FIND MYSELF HITTING THE SEND AND RECEIVE BUTTON ON THE EMAIL A LOT JUST OUT OF BOREDOM LIKE C COME ON GIMME SOMETHING
IT IS SCARY
YEAH
IT'S CRAZY
SO
SHOULD
HAS IT BEEN FORTY MINUTES OR WHATEVER
THIS HAS BEEN LONG ENOUGH
IS THAT THE ONLY SONG YOU HAVE
THAT'S AWESOME
MAYBE I HAVE A DIFFERENT ONE
READY FOR THIS
OH MAN
NO IT'S IMPORTANT TO WE TALKED A QUITE A BIT ABOUT UH YOU KNOW THE THE INTERCHANGEABLE UH FACES AND WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS COME UP WITH A BIT OF A NATURAL LOOK HERE UM F WE CALL IT FRUITY IF YOU WILL
UM
RIGHT UM
OF COURSE THAT'S UH INTERCHANGEABLE AND UH I THINK IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE FOR THE UH FOR THE REGULAR PRODUCT IN THE IN THE IN THE IN THE FIRST PACKAGING TO BE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE SUBDUED BUT THIS IS KIND OF SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE UM AND AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE TELEVISION THERE UH WE HAVE THE UH VOICE DETECTOR DEVICE UM ON THE TOP THERE
UM
SO THAT THAT WILL WORK QUITE WELL WITH WITH REGARD TO FINDING THIS UH CONTRAPTION
UM WHAT OTHER THINGS DO WE SEE HERE WELL UM IF YOU GIVE IT A TOUCH IT DOES HAVE ACTUALLY A BIT OF A SPONGY FEEL
UM SO I THINK THAT WILL WORK WELL WITH REGARDS TO OUR MARKET
UM AND UH LET'S SEE WELL CLEARLY THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MORE COLOURS AND WHAT NOT AVAILABLE
UM UH DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO THAT
IT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE TELEVISION UH YOU KNOW IF THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT I IT ACTUALLY IS EDIBLE INSIDE
UM IT'S ENCASED IN A NEW UH TYPE OF UH
POLYMER YEAH
IT'S FINE
HMM
IT'S POS A POSSIBLE NEW PRODUCT
UM BUT I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT SUMS UP THE MAIN FEATURES OF OUR OF THE REMOTE
UM I DUNNO IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR F WHETHER THAT UH WHETHER WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ANY UH OTHER MARKETING AREAS OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE
UM DID WE COME IN UNDER BUDGET
MM-HMM
MM
DID WE TALK ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH OPTION
SO UH SO UH YEAH ON THE BACK HERE YOU ALL NOTICED THIS AREA HERE WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH UH CONSOLE AND UH I THINK IT'S NICELY DESIGNED INTO THE INTO THE OVERALL LOOK
UM BUT BASICALLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH INCORPORATES UM THE LATEST DESIGNS THAT OUR RESEARCH TEAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO CUFW UH COME UP WITH
BASICALLY UH QUITE SIMILAR TO THE COFFEE MAKER UM DESIGN THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER AND UM
I THINK THAT UH HAS GIVEN A PROVEN UM EASE OF USE AND WHAT NOT
AND UH ALLOWS FEATURES LIKE THE REMOTE ACTUALLY TALKING BACK TO THE USER UM SO
WELL WE DIDN'T QUITE HAVE ENOUGH MATERIAL UH
OH I SEE RIGHT UM
RIGHT
ACTUALLY THIS BOTTOM RED RING HERE JUST UNCLIPS AND THEN YOU PUT A A NEW A NEW UH A NEW PLATE ON TOP OF THAT
SO I MEAN THERE ARE I WE DEFINITELY PRICED OUT A SPONGY EVEN SPONGIER NON NATURAL LOOK UM MATERIALS WHICH I THINK WORKED OUT FINE
WE ALSO CONTINUED ON WITH THE IDEAS THAT F FOLLOWING UH APPLE'S COLOUR SCHEMES WITH THE KIND OF THE UH LIGHT ORANGE AND THE GREEN
THE VOICE RECOGNITION AREA ACTUALLY DOUBLES AS UH AS THE SOLAR CELL AREA
YEAH
I MEAN I THINK THAT UH IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT BEING ONE OF OUR MAIN SELLING FEATURES BEING ENVIRONMENTAL AND WITHOUT THE BATTERIES AND WHAT NOT
ALTHOUGH IT DOES STILL HAVE A BATTERY SO I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE SELL IS ON THAT
I MEAN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWAY ME ON THE IDEA THAT WE OUR MAIN SELLING POINT COULD BE ALREADY THIS VOICE RECOGNITION THING I MEAN THAT'S WHAT SETS US APART RIGHT
AND THE REALITY IS YOU KNOW FOR ME FROM AN IDEOLOGICAL STAND POINT I'D LIKE TO STICK WITH THE UH THE SOLAR CELL
BUT I H KIND OF HAVE TO THROW MYSELF IN THE IN THE BUSINESS STRUCTURE MODEL HERE AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO COME TO A COMPROMISE HERE AND MAYBE MOVE AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT
WITHOUT THE SOLAR CELL
SAVINGS
NO I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD COMPROMISE YOU BROUGHT FORWARD SARAH
YEP
THEY LIKE THAT SPONGY FEEL
AND THE PAGING FUNCTION WORKS WELL THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR WE WORKED HARD ON THAT ONE
W WE MIGHT HAVE UH WE MIGHT HAVE LOST THAT GRANOLA MARKET AGAIN THAT WE'RE
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE
WE DIDN'T USE THE WHITEBOARD AT ALL
AND
UM ALSO HAD I NOT BEEN INTRIGUED ABOUT THE PEN I DON'T THINK I WOULDA USED IT AT ALL I DIDN'T WRITE BARELY ANYTHING
UH
YEAH
I SO I DON'T N I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
WE COULD DO WHATEVER BASICALLY WHAT WE WANTED UNTIL THE BUDGET CAME DOWN ON US UM
WITH THE NATURAL LOOK
I THINK THE TEAMWORK WAS GOOD AS WELL
WELL I THINK THAT WAS I THINK THAT WAS AN ISSUE I KEPT FINDING WITH REGARD TO WELL NO BUT ALSO YEAH WHEN I WAS REPORTING ABOUT WHAT EACH OF US WAS DOING I WAS OFTEN CONFUSED AS TO WHAT YOU WERE DOING UM AND THEN I ALSO FELT LIKE YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR DISCUSSION WOULD CENTRE AROUND N SPECIFICALLY WHAT MY TASK WAS BECAUSE THAT WAS KIND OF THE INTERFACE PORTION WHICH WAS WHAT THE WHOLE PROJECT WAS ABOUT UH BUT AND THEN IN THE END I THINK OUR JOBS KIND OF MELDED TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT MORE
WHICH WAS FINE
MM-HMM
AND I THINK YOUR LEADERSHIP WAS QUITE GOOD
AN SO IS THAT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE TAKEN ON THAT KIND OF ROLE
I HAD TO ADMIT AS SOON AS W WE STARTED I MEAN AS SOON AS WE GOT THE PLAY DOH
TH YOU KNOW THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF REALLY TRYING TO STICK WITH REALITY WENT OUT THE WINDOW
POSSIBLY
OH YEAH STILL HAVE 'EM
YEP
I MEAN I THINK HAD THE ISSUE BEEN MORE SERIOUS WE PROBABLY WOULDA BRAINSTORMED MORE DURING OUR MEETINGS AS A TEAM
WELL I DUNNO WHAT I WOULDA SHOWN ON THAT BOARD
I MEAN IT'S JUST LIKE THE PAPER I DON'T KNOW WHAT I REALLY NEEDED THE PAPER FOR
UM BECAUSE I'VE GOT THIS LAPTOP
STANDARD I JUST USED IT 'CAUSE IT'S LITERALLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
SO IS THIS ALL WE NEED TO GET THROUGH
IS IT
ANY NEW IDEAS WITH REGARD TO REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS
WHAT IS THAT
OUR LIMITED ABILITY TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
WHY
HUH I THINK IT WAS THE REAL
YEAH
THINK IT WAS ALSO REALISATION OF YOU BASICALLY JUST COPY AND PASTE WHAT'S GIVEN TO YOU INTO YOUR PRESENTATION WHICH UH WASN'T SO CLEAR TO ME AT THE BEGINNING
OH I ADDED LIKE FIVE SLIDES TOO BUT I
YEAH MINE TOO
NO
I ADDED MANY SLIDES EVERY TIME YEAH
UM
EVEN YOU
ACTUALLY THAT LOOKED A LOT MORE LIKE A TONGUE FROM PREVIOUS TO UH FR SOME OTHER DESIGN UH MODIFICATIONS
I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THE UH INCORPORATION OF SOME TIN FOIL FROM A UH RANDOM KIT KAT BAR THAT HAPPENED TO BE CONSUMED
SO AGAIN I REITERATE MY QUESTION OF HOW DIFFERENT WE ARE COMP COMPARED TO THE OTHER GROUPS ESPECIALLY BETWEEN CULTURE GROUPS AND WHAT NOT
MM
WHAT THE UHS AND THE
MM
THAT'S SCARY YEAH
WELL JUST AROUND THAT EIGHT OR OR NINE PEOPLE THAT ARE
DUDE I THINK WE'VE HAD INTERNET FOR LIKE EIGHTEEN YEARS
IN THE EIGHTIES
RIGHT
YEAH IT WAS TO THE LIKE SEVEN UNIVERSITIES OR SOMETHING
YOU GUYS READY TO CELEBRATE
CELEBRATE
THERE IS ANOTHER ONE
HUH
YEP
OKAY
OH I TOTALLY
YEAH 'CAUSE I MOVED IT
'S PUT IT OVER HERE
THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT
HUH
YEAH THAT'S NOT YOU
AH
FAIR ENOUGH
MM
RIGHT
APPROPRIATE OKAY
MM 'KAY
IT IS AN OPTION
AH
I SEE
NICE
DO WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT UM ROT FACTORS
OH OKAY THERE'S PRESERVATIVES INVOLVED WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY OKAY
FAIR ENOUGH
NO BUT
IT'S A COUPLE YEARS OFF AT LEAST
OKAY
MM
MM
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
MM 'KAY
RIGHT
DO WE HAVE UM OTHER FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD SKINS
COVERS
IN PLAY NOW OR ARE THOSE ONES GONNA BE DEVELOPED LATER ONCE WE SEE HOW THE COUPLE WE HAVE G GO OR
DO WE KNOW WHERE WE STAND ON THAT YET
OH I WASN'T EXPECTING A PROTOTYPE I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY IN MIND YET
OKAY
JUST VENEER REALLY YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
AND THE WHOLE THING
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH
THERE'S
OKAY
MM 'KAY
OKAY VERY COOL
OKAY
OKAY
YEP
IT'S STILL AN OPTION IF WE NEED IT
VERY COOL NICE JOB
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
M COME IN AT SIXTEEN
YEAH
MM K
TRUE
NAH
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T WANNA GET RID OF THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENTAL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE SOLAR CELL IS A BIG PIECE OF THE WAY WE'RE MARKETING THIS AS LIKE A NATURAL
NEW THING BUT HONESTLY IF WE CUT THAT ONE PIECE OUT WE'RE ACTUALLY COMING IN UNDER BUDGET IF I'VE DONE MY MATH CORRECTLY
I MEAN
WHICH IT'S YEAH THAT'S WHAT SETTING US INTO THIS YOUNG MARKET I MEAN THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED FROM SO
I DON'T KNOW
AND I MEAN YOU KNOW PERHAPS WHEN THE CELL TECHNOLOGY COMES DOWN IN PRICE WE CAN BRING THAT BACK INTO THE GAME BUT IT LOOKS LIKE AT THIS POINT THAT MAY BE OUT OF OUR LEAGUE
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S OUR BEST OPTION
MM
IT KIND OF YEAH
MM MM
YEAH
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE ARE
THAT WOULD BE ME
UM CORD
NO PROBLEM
CAN YOU REACH THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU
I DIDN'T EVEN DO THAT ONE ON PURPOSE EITHER DAMN
OKAY UM
BASICALLY I WAS JUST EVALUATING UM FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF HOW OUR PRODUCT'S WORKING RIGHT NOW WITH THE CRITERIA THAT WE SET AT THE BEGINNING OF THESE ARE THE THINGS WE NEEDED TO DO
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE WE FEEL THEY'RE IMPORTANT
UM SO I WAS LOOKING AT BASIC DESIGN THINGS DOES IT FULFIL ITS FUNCTIONS AS A REMOTE
IS THE DESIGN WHAT WE WANTED IT TO DO
I ARE TECHNOLOGIES UP TO WHERE WE HOPED THEY WOULD BE AND DOES IT FULFIL THE AESTHETIC QUALITIES THAT OUR ORIGINAL MARKET RESEARCH WAS LOOKING FOR
UM
BASIC QUESTIONS LIKE YOU KNOW DOES IT TURN ON
DOES IT RESPOND TO VOICE RECOGNITION
AND OVERALL IN GENERAL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COMING UP TO PAR
UM THE ONLY THING IS WITH WITH THE PULL OUT PANEL THAT IS CAN IT TAKE SOME ADJUSTING BECAUSE IT'S A NEW SORT OF INTERFACE
UM THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COMING UP ROUGH BUT THEN ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT IT DOES MAKE A LOT OF SENSE
SO I THINK OVERALL WE'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
SO
YEAH
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING OVER WELL SO
WE'RE WE'RE GOOD YEAH
YEAH
IT'S I THINK EVENTUALLY IF WE DO UM BRANCH OUT WITH THIS PRODUCT MAYBE WE DO HAVE A HIGHER BUDGET OPTIONS AND IF IT GOES OVER WITH THIS MODEL WE CAN LOOK INTO UM WIDER RANGE VOICE RECOGNITION LIKE FROM OTHER ROOMS OF THE HOUSE AND STUFF
BUT FOR NOW WHAT WE'VE GOT IS WORKING IN THE RANGE WE NEED IT FOR SO IT'S ALL GOOD
THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM ME
YEAH
YEAH IT IS A SET BACK BUT
OKAY DO YOU NEED THE CORD BACK
AS IN WITHIN THE TEAM OR
OKAY
IT IS NOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE SO THERE YOU GO
WHATEVER
UM
I THINK THEY'RE STARTING BLOCKS YEAH
UM YOU KNOW I THINK IN GENERAL FOR A DAY'S WORTH OF WORK WE ACTUALLY WERE RELATIVELY PRODUCTIVE
CONSIDERING THE LITTLE AMOUNT OF INPUT WE HAD GOING IN
UM AND THE TECHNOLOGY HAS DEFINITELY BEEN A HELP IT'S REALLY BEEN INTERESTING TO TRY OUT ALL THIS NEW STUFF
NO WE DIDN'T
WE COULD NOW IF THAT'D MAKE UP FOR IT BUT REALLY AND I FEEL LIKE IF YOU GUYS HAD BEEN DESIGNING IN HERE PERHAPS THAT WOULD HAVE CHANGED BUT BECAUSE OF ROOM CONSTRAINTS
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
YEAH I THINK I WAS TAKING NOTES MORE OFTEN THAN USUAL JUST 'CAUSE I LIKED THE PEN YEAH
MM
I AM DISAPPOINTED I DIDN'T GET A NOTE BACK FROM MY PERSONAL COACH
YEAH BUT I DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE SO WE'LL SEE
OKAY THAT WOULD BE KINDA CREEPY
WELL WHAT KIND OF COACHING IS THAT REALLY
WHAT IF I REALLY NEEDED SOMETHING
I THINK SO
AND EVEN THEN WE DID GET A DECENT PRODUCT TURNED OUT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT EVERYTHING WE WANTED IT TO BE
ORGANIC REALLY
AND HIGHLY RESOURCEFUL TEAM MATES MIGHT I ADD WHICH IS ALWAYS A PLUS
MM YEAH I'M IMPRESSED
NICE
ALL FOUR OF THOSE LITTLE CONTAINERS
YEAH
YOU COULD HAVE DEVELOPED MULTIPLE SKINS REALLY HAD YOU HAD MORE COLOURS
OH WELL
THEY WERE GOOD
YEAH
TRUE
DO YOUR OWN
THOUGH I DID FEEL LIKE TH THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION DROPPED OFF SEVERELY OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BUT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET ANY INFORMATION FOR THE LAST PRESENTATION AT ALL
NOTHING I DIDN'T EVEN GET AN EMAIL LIKE THAT WAS IT
SO YEAH I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS SLIGHTLY LACKING BUT THEN YOU KNOW FILL IN THE BLANKS ON YOUR OWN LEVEL OF CREATIVITY UPPED
WHATEVER
MM-HMM
UH-HUH THAT WASN'T VERY MUCH
MM
YES
HMM VERY MUCH SO
YEAH ALREADY HAVING THE FORMATTED STUFF HELPED A LOT
VERY MUCH SO
HMM
YEAH
THAT'S KIND OF A GOOD THING THOUGH YOU KNOW GIVE THE REST OF US SOME STRUCTURE TO WORK WITH SO HEY
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
I EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE MOMENTS WHERE IT JUST GOT OUT OF HAND AND I KNEW WE WERE ALL LYING THROUGH OUR TEETH OTHER THAN THAT
I COULD ONLY IMAGINE
YEAH
TOTALLY
I THINK SO
THOUGH WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY I MEAN OTHER THAN MINOR DISCUSSION AT MEETINGS THERE WASN'T EXCEPT FOR THE ACTUAL BUILDING
BUT I FEEL LIKE IF THIS WAS A TEAM PROJECT THERE ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE OF THE COLLABORATIVE LIKE BRAINSTORMING
USE THE BOARD WELL AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN SIX MONTHS' WORTH OF WORK NOT LIKE THREE HOURS' WORTH OF MEETINGS
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH THAT IS KIND OF
MINE WAS THE MICS
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE GETTING UP AND DOWN AND DEALING WITH ALL THESE WIRES I WAS AFRAID I WAS GONNA BREAK SOMETHING ACTUALLY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
TRUE BUT IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO ME AS AN OPTION I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE BUT I KNOW THAT I CONSCIOUSLY DIDN'T
TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
WELL IT LOOKS REALLY PROFESSIONAL
I KNOW
I KNOW I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO BE PROFESSIONAL SO I DIDN'T LIKE DRAW ALL OVER MY PAPER AND STUFF
OKAY WELL NOT ENTIRELY BUT STILL I DOODLED LESS THAN I USUALLY DO
I GUESS
UM
IT DID IT JUST SAY IN AN EMAIL THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS THAT
THAT SLIDE WAS LIKE THAT
WELL
UH I THINK THEY STILL DO THEIR JOB
I AM THINKING OUTSIDE THE LITTLE SQUARE BOX THOUGH WITH LITERALLY IN LIKE FORM I DON'T
YEAH
IT'S STILL GOTTA BE TECHNICALLY CAR SHAPED OR IT WON'T FIT ON THE ROAD YOU KNOW
DON'T KNOW
KIND OF
OH HOW LONG WAS OUR MEETING SUPPOSED TO BE
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE LEFT
MM
YEAH
AT THE BEGINNING IT STARTED OUT AND I FELT ACTUALLY LIKE UNDER PRESSURE LIKE THE FIRST COUPLE WERE TAKING A LOT OF WORK AND I WAS LIKE HAD LIKE ALL THIS BRAINSTORMING I WAS DOING AND THEN SUDDENLY I WAS LIKE WELL IT'S JUST ANOTHER TWO MINUTE PRESENTATION THAT YOU GUYS DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT ANYWAY SO TYPE AWAY
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE WE ALL SORT OF KNEW WHERE WE WERE HEADED WITH IT SO IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT MATTERED ANYMORE
MM-HMM
WHATEVER
YEAH
VERY MUCH YEAH
SEE I ONLY GOT BLANK ONES
MY SLIDES WERE ALL BLANK THEY'D HAVE A TITLE MAYBE AND THEY WERE JUST EMPTY
LIKE WITH THOSE WORDS ALREADY ON IT
NO
I WONDERED WHY YOURS ALWAYS LOOKED SO MORE COMPLICATED
I THINK I ADDED A SLIDE ONE TIME
HEY WITH THE WHOLE NEW BACKGROUND BEING INNOVATIVE YEAH THAT WAS CLASS
MM
I WANNA KNOW HOW OUR PRODUCT WOULD FARE
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT THERE
I THINK IT WOULD TAKE EXTENSIVE MARKETING OKAY AN APPLE WITH A RED BUTTON ON TOP EVEN I AM SCEPTICAL
BUT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE
YEAH
I KNOW IT IS
MM
I I NOTICED THAT
BY ACCIDENT
WELL HUH
AN INTERESTING DAY ALL IN ALL I WOULD SAY
I KNOW
I
YEAH
'CAUSE IT'S SUCH A FUNCTIONAL ITEM
MM
MM
WE GOT IT TO BE
LIKE CUTTING CORNERS
KIND OF THOUGH IT WAS REALLY TECHNICALLY AN EVALUATION OF THE PRODUCT NOT THE PROJECT IN GENERAL
WHICH I'M NOT SURE IS THE SAME THING AT THE TIME THAT JUST I MADE MORE SENSE BUT I COULD SEE IF THEY WERE REALLY ASKING ABOUT US
YAY
MAKE IT SOUND ELOQUENT
OH
I HAVE TO DONE I'VE I'VE DONE TRANSCRIPTION BEFORE AND IT'S REALLY RIDICULOUS HOW MANY WORDS PEOPLE SAY LIKE JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR SENTENCES LIKE THAT THAT MEAN NOTHING
THERE'S A GUY STUDYING IT HERE YEAH HE'S STUDYING UMS AND AHS OR SOMETHING
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD WORD FOR IT
JUST ADD SOME PREFIXES SOUNDS CLASSIER
I YEAH PRETTY COMPULSIVELY DURING MEETINGS LIKE YEAH
YEAH WE ARE ADDICTS
MM
YEAH
I YEAH
TRUE
I YEAH
BUT IT'S NOT REGULAR I MEAN MY GRANDPARENTS HAD IT IN THE EIGHTIES AND I GOT IT IN NINETY FOUR BUT STILL
UH-HUH
MY UM GRAMMY DOES COMPUTER SCIENCE BACK IN THE STATES AND SO THEY HAD UM AN E. D. U. AND GOV NETWORK
THERE'S BASICALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURES BUT IT WASN'T UH HOUSEHOLD TO HOUSEHOLD YET BECAUSE IT HADN'T BEEN
PARTITIONED OFF AND STUFF YEAH THAT WAS HIM
APPARENTLY DOES THAT INCLUDE LIKE CHAMPAGNE OR SOMETHING EXCITING

THEY WANT THE ERGONOMIC ONES
YEAH
ONES THAT ONES THAT LOOK HIGH TECH TOO

SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE MY MOTHER CAN USE IT
YEAH
'KAY
ANYBODY HAVE ANY EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER THAT
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
DO SOME OF THEM USE TRIPLE A. S THOUGH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
BUT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE SIZE OF IT TOO
WELL W AS LONG AS WE KNOW THAT ISSUE IS
HERE WE CAN
TRIPLE A
BUT IT'S OKAY WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT IT NOW JUST AS LONG AS WE REMEMBER BATTERY TYPE AND SIZE IS IMPORTANT
HEY
ANYTHING ELSE
ALRIGHT
MOVING ALONG
OH WE'RE CLOSING THE MEETING
NEXT MEETING IS GONNA START IN THIRTY MINUTES
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
UM THE I. D. WHICH IS WHO

WELL WE WANNA MAKE A MULTIFUNCTIONAL REMOTE RIGHT
ONE REMOTE FOR EVERYTHING
UM
I THINK THEY'LL BE PHASING V. H. S. OUT SHORTLY
OKAY
SO WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE IT HOW TO COVER ALL THE DIFFERENT VARIANCES IN SIGNALS
WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING WITH THE CURVATURE LIKE THAT MATCHES THE CURVATURE OF A HAND
WHAT KINDA BATTERY WOULD WE WANT TO USE

AND THEN WE'RE GONNA CLOSE UP THE MEETING
AND WE'RE GONNA DO THIS ALL IN ABOUT FORTY MINUTES
OKAY
FIRST I WANT TO DISCUSS THE GOALS OF THIS MEETING
FIRST WE NEED TO DETERMINE THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND THE QUESTION THAT WE CAN ASK OURSELVES IS WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED BY THIS REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DETERMINE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE APPARATUS
WHAT ACTUALLY IS IT SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT DO PEOPLE PICK UP THE REMOTE AND USE IT FOR
AND THEN LASTLY WE'RE GOING TO DETERMINE ITS WORKING DESIGN HOW EXACTLY WILL IT PERFORM ITS FUNCTIONS THAT'S THE WHOLE TECHNICAL SIDE OF
'KAY I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A MINUTE 'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE MAKING SOME NOTES
'KAY
OH WELL LET'S GO AHEAD AND BACK PREVIOUS
SO WHAT I WANNA DO RIGHT NOW IS HEAR FROM ALL THREE OF YOU ON YOUR RESEARCH THAT YOU JUST DID

OKAY
WHO WOULD LIKE TO UM FOLLOW THAT ONE UP

DO YOU WANT ME TO RUN IT OR YOU WANNA OKAY
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
'KAY
ALRIGHT
NOW WE HAVE COURTNEY WITH THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
OKAY WHAT DO YOU M OH I'M SORRY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY UM THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL WITH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER LIKE THEY HAVE TO PRESS THE BUTTONS
OKAY
OH RIGHT
THE BUTTONS
OKAY
YEAH

READY FOR THE NEXT SLIDE
HMM
IT'S OKAY
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

USER FRIENDLY
AND SO JUST TO JUST TO CLARIFY BY SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU MEAN THEY WOULD SAY CHANNEL FIVE AND THE THING WOULD GO TO CHANNEL FIVE
OKAY
OH THAT'D BE LOVELY
DIDN'T THEY UM DIDN'T OUR RIVAL COMPANIES MANUFACTURE A REMOTE THAT YOU WOULD PRESS THE BUTTON ON THE T. V. AND IT WOULD THE REMOTE WOULD BEEP SO IF YOU HAVE LOST IT
MM
OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
WE COULD DEFINITELY INCLUDE THAT IF WE WANTED TO
IF IT'S WITHIN OUR PRICE
OKAY
ARE WE READY FOR OUR LAST PRESENTATION AMBER
OKAY
THERE WE GO
'KAY
OH MY BAD
OKAY
READY
THAT'S OKAY
HMM
SO THIS WOULD BE THE FRONT
SO THE RED WOULD BE THE FRONT OF THE REMOTE THOUGH RIGHT
OKAY
THE L THE LIGHT UP KIND OF YEAH
HMM
IT'D PROBABLY BE LIGHTING UP THE KEY TOO RIGHT
'KAY
THE BUTTONS
OKAY

WE'LL COME TO DECISION LATER ABOUT ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT WE NEED TO INCLUDE LET'S UM WRAP UP THIS ONE AND I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MY POWERPOINT
'CAUSE WE NEED TO DISCUSS THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS WHICH YOU MIGHT'VE ALREADY SEEN FLASHED UP ON THE SCREEN A BIT EARLIER
WAIT COME BACK
ALRIGHT
SORRY LET'S GO THROUGH THIS
ALRIGHT
HERE WE GO
NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
FIRST IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE A T. V. REMOTE
WE'RE TRYING NOT TO OVER COMPLICATE THINGS
SO NO D. V. D. NO TIVO NO STEREO
IT'S NOT GONNA BE MULTI FUNCTIONAL
HEY
AND WE TH NEED TO PROMOTE OUR COMPANY MORE SO WE NEED TO SOMEHOW INCLUDE OUR COLOUR AND OUR COMPANY SLOGAN ON THE REMOTE
WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR NAME OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
OKAY
AND YOU KNOW WHAT TELETEXT IS
IN STATES WE DON'T HAVE IT BUT UM IT'S LIKE THEY JUST HAVE THIS CHANNEL WHERE JUST HAS NEWS AND WEATHER KIND OF SPORTS
IT'S VERY UM BLAND LOOKING IT'S JUST TEXT ON THE SCREEN NOT EVEN YEAH JUST BLACK WITH JUST TEXT
YEAH
KIND OF
YEAH IT'S THE WHOLE SCREEN
SO ANYWAY
RIGHT
RIGHT
BUT IT'S BECOMING OUT DATED NOW BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET
NOBODY NEEDS TO GO TO THE TELETEXT CHANNEL TO CHECK THE NEWS
AND WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS CHANNELS NOW TOO SO THOSE ARE OUR NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
YES
IT'S PART OF THE LOGO
OKAY
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW IS COME TO SOME DECISIONS DEFINITIVE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON
ABOUT UM THE TARGET GROUP AND THE FUNCTIONS AND JUST DEFINITE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO AND THEN WE'LL CLOSE UP THE MEETING
SO
ALRIGHT
WHATEVER
OKAY
SO OUR TARGET GROUP IS YOU MENTIONED UM OLDER PEOPLE
WOULD IT JUST BE UNIVERSAL FOR EVERYONE YOU THINK
BECAUSE I THINK EVEN IF SOMETHING HAS LARGE BUTTONS AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT CHILDISHLY LARGE LIKE EVEN TECHNICALLY
NON TECHNICALLY CHALLENGED PEOPLE ARE GONNA USE IT
I MEAN THEY WANT SOMETHING USER FRIENDLY SO
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY SO WE WANT UM FOR OUR TARGET GROUP WOULD WE SAY
I MEAN YOUNG AND OLD ALL AGE RANGES ALL UM NOT KIDS OBVIOUSLY RIGHT
OR KIDS
OKAY SO WE'RE GOING TO GO ANYWHERE FROM KIDS TO ADULT IN THE AGE RANGE UM WHAT ABOUT
TECHNIC TECHNICAL UM SPECIFICATIONS LIKE HOW HOW TECHNICALLY LITERATE ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE USING OUR REMOTE
OKAY
RIGHT OKAY
SO SO THEY NEED NO TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE TO OPERATE
OKAY
AND WE ALSO NEED TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THIS JUST TO GET IT ALL OUT ON PAPER
SO WE SAID IT NEEDS TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE T. V. NEEDS TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL TURN ON AND OFF JUST BASIC SIMPLE STUFF LIKE THIS
SO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING JUST SAY IT AND WE'LL ADD IT TO MY MEETING MINUTES
MM-HMM VOLUME
RIGHT
AND WE WANNA KEEP UM I'LL MAKE A NOTE HERE THAT WE WANNA KEEP THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS DOWN
CORRECT BECAUSE PEOPLE ONLY USE TEN PERCENT
'KAY
HEY WHAT ELSE
UM
I THINK SO
WHAT DO YOU
A FINDING KIND OF DEVICE OR YEAH HO HOMING DEVICE
MM 'KAY
OKAY
RIGHT
HMM
WOULD THAT ADD TO OUR COSTS AT ALL I WONDER
RIGHT
OKAY
I I THINK WE CAN MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THAT LATER
UH WE'LL STILL PUT THAT AS A POINT THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS
SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE BATTERY SOURCE
POWER SOURCE RATHER
IS IT GOING TO HAVE A CHARGER OR IS IT GOING TO BE RUN STRICTLY OFF BATTERIES
AND WE ALSO NEED TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE YOU MENTIONED OF SPEECH RECOGNITION IF WE WANT THAT
MM
YOU COULD UM WE COULD HOOK IT UP
OH
MM-HMM
AND IF AND IF WE INTRODUCED IT WHEN THEY'RE THIS AGE THEY'RE GOING TO PROBABLY ALWAYS BUY A REMOTE THAT HAS
RIGHT
YEAH
AND THE SPEECH RECOGNITION COULD BE PART OF THE LOST AND FOUND DEVICE TOO
IF WE SAID FIND REMOTE LOCATE REMOTE OR SOMETHING
A CERTAIN PHRASE
THEN IT COULD BEEP
I DUNNO
JUST THROWING IT OUT THERE
WELL
OKAY ANYTHING ELSE WE WANNA DISCUSS
UM
HOW HOW YEAH HOW WOULD YOU LEAVE THOSE OUT
UNLESS YOU COULD SAY THE CHANNEL
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT IN THIS DAY IN AGE WE NEED YOU KNOW LIKE A HUNDRED BUTTON TOO
I USED TO HAVE A REMOTE THAT DID NOT EVEN GO UP PAST LIKE FIFTY
SO I COULDN'T WHENEVER I GOT CABLE I HAD TO GET A NEW T. V.
MM
GET YOUR OWN REMOTE OR DIGITAL CABLE
'KAY
UM
I GUESS WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THE PROJECT FINANCING LATER MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN FIT ALL OF THE STUFF THAT WE WANT TO ON OUR BUDGET
UM
'KAY
AND DON'T FORGET WE NEED TO INCLUDE THE COLOUR
OF OUR COMPANY AND THE LOGO
I'M GUESSING
AND THE R. R.
WE COULD JUST HAVE THE LOGO IN YELLOW OR MAYBE A YELLOW LIGHT FOR THE KEYS
RIGHT
SO WE'VE SIMPLIFIED WE DON'T NEED ALL THOSE UM PLAY FAST FORWARD REWIND
OR NO MENU BUTTONS
SO WE'VE PRETTY MUCH PARED IT DOWN TO ON OFF VOLUME MUTE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN UM THE NUMBERS
YEAH
UM CAN WE GO BACK TO I'M GONNA LOOK REALLY QUICKLY BACK AT THOSE
EXAMPLES AND SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING
WHICH ONE IS YOURS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OR FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
OKAY
THE T. V.
I THINK THAT THAT'S FINE JUST FOR THE T. V.
I MEAN HOW OFTEN DOES THE AVERAGE USER NEED TO DO THAT KIND OF STUFF
HMM
COULDN'T WE DO THAT ALL THROUGH ONE BUTTON SOMETHING A MENU BUTTON THAT POPS UP WITH A MENU ON THE T. V. THAT SAYS
YOU KNOW AUDIO VIDEO WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOU KNOW
FOR THE MENUS
THAT'S TRUE
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MAYB YOU KNOW
Y RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
THAT ONE
RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE PERHAPS
YEP
GOOD
ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THEY'D LIKE TO BRING UP IN THIS MEETING
OKAY
GET OUT OF HERE
LET'S GO BACK TO THE MEETING CLOSURE THEN AND SEE WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT
MM
ALRIGHT
AFTER THIS MEETING WE'RE GONNA BE SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE AND SUMMARY AGAIN WHICH WE NEED TO REPLY TO THAT E MAIL
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE LUNCH BREAK
AND AFTER LUNCH THIRTY MINUTES OF INDIVIDUAL WORK TIME
UM I'M GONNA PUT THE MINUTES I PUT THE MINUTES FOR THE FIRST MEETING ALREADY IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IF YOU'D LIKE TO REVIEW THEM
AND I'M GONNA TYPE UP THE MINUTES FOR THIS ONE AS WELL
UM HERE'S WHAT WE'RE EACH GOING TO DO
THE I. D. IS GOING TO WORK ON THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT UM U. I. D. THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOME TREND WATCHING
'KAY
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
AND IF ANYBODY HAS ANYTHING THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADD
NO
OKAY WELL THIS MEETING IS OFFICIALLY OVER
THANK YOU ALL
DID YOU SEND IT
OKAY
GREAT
WE ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF OUR BRAINS
YEAH
DO WE REALLY NEED T TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT R. S. I. IS
YEAH I'M JUST TRYING TO MOVE IT
'KAY
I THINK IT SHOULD BE THERE WORKING DESIGN
'KAY
UH I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO COMPLETE THIS ONE 'CAUSE SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT I WAS GIVEN WERE FRUSTRATING
UH OKAY SO METHOD METHOD OF OUR DESIGN I THINK I JUST START LISTING TH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO PUT INTO THIS
WE NEED A POWER SOURCE WE'RE GONNA NEED A SMART CHIP IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT MULTI FUNCTIONAL
UM EXTRA FUNCTIONS WILL PROBABLY NEED AN ADDITIONAL CHIP
EITHER THAT OR THE SMART CHIP WILL HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY SMART
USUALLY A SMART CHIP IS JUST A CHIP THAT'S BEEN PROGRAMMED AND DESIGNED SO THAT IT CAN COMPLETE A FAIR RANGE OF FUNCTIONS
I WOULDN'T THINK SO 'CAUSE WE COULD PROBABLY GET IT FROM LIKE IN BULK FROM A A NEWER COMPANY
AND THEY TEND TO SELL THEIR CHIPS PRETTY CHEAP
UM YEP NOTHING HERE
UM POWER SOURCE I FIGURED BATTERIES 'CAUSE THEY'RE EASILY AVAILABLE
TYPICALLY A REMOTE HAS EITHER TWO DOUBLE A. S OR FOUR TRIPLE A. S SOMETIMES THREE
UH IT REALLY KINDA DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE ITSELF
UM A LARGE ON OFF BUTTON DEMOGRAPHICALLY WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS AN OLDER GENERATION OF PEOPLE SO A LARGE ON OFF BUTTON WOULD PROBABLY BE GOOD
SELECTION BUTTON FOR VARIOUS ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES SO YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL PERMIT YOU TO SELECT THE D. V. D. PLAYER OR THE T. V. OR THE STEREO SYSTEM
UM SMART CHIP THAT PERVERTS UH THAT PERMITS SORRY UNIVERSAL APPLICATION AGAIN
SOMETHING THAT'LL ALLOW US TO SKIP OVER BETWEEN DEVICES AND THAT'S KINDA IT
UH THIS IS MY FIFTY SECOND DESIGN
POWER SOURCE OVER HERE
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SWITCH OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN THE POWER SOURCE AND THE REST OF IT AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED THE SWITCH
UM EXTRA BULB COULD JUST BE FOR FLASHINESS UM SUBCOMPONENT WHICH WOULD BE LIKE A WAY OF DIVERTING THE POWER TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE THE DEVICE
UM THE CHIP AND OF COURSE THE INFRA RED BULB SO IT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE VARIOUS DEVICES THAT IT NEEDS TO TALK TO
THIS IS JUST LIKE A ROUGH SCHEMATIC
SO THIS IS THE INTERNAL WORKINGS
YEAH
YEAH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO STARE AT THAT INFRA RED 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN THE BATTERY STARTS DYING IN YOUR REMOTE CURRENTLY
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY STARE AT THAT BULB AND GO OKAY WHEN I PUSH THIS BUTTON IS IT WORKING
WE CAN SKIP THAT WHOLE THING
YEP
SO YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE DARK
YEAH THAT'S IT
I THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS
OKAY
YOU CAN ALSO GET THE KIND OF THE T. V. GUIDE SO
IT'S THE ENTIRE SCREEN IS JUST RUNNING INFORMATION AT RANDOM
SEEMINGLY
OKAY
SO DO WE HAVE TO INCLUDE THE COMPANY COLOUR WITHIN THAT
MM WELL EVEN IF WE KEPT THE REGULAR STANDARD SIZE OF REMOTE
IF WE REDUCED THE BUTTONS DOWN TO THE ONES THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY USE THE MOST OFTEN AND A COUPLE EXTRA
'CAUSE THEY'RE SAYING THEY ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF THEM THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE FAIRLY DECENT SIZED BUTTONS
MOST OF THEM WILL INTUITIVELY PICK IT UP THOUGH
HOW 'BOUT LITTLE TO NO BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT NO
DO WE WANT THIS THING TO BE ABLE TO BE FOUND EASILY
AND
LIKE IF THIS IS GONNA GET LOST UNDERNEATH THE COACH HOW ARE WE GOING TO ACCOMMODATE THE QUICK ABILITY TO FIND IT
WHAT IF WE GAVE IT A CHARGER
AND ON THE CHARGER JUST LIKE A PHONE LIKE YOU GET A PORTABLE PHONE AND IT'S GOT A CHARGER AND IF YOU D LEAVE YOUR PHONE SOMEWHERE
YOU PUSH THE BUTTON TO FIND IT AND IT FINDS TH THE PHONE BEEPS FOR YOU
IT'S USEFUL FOR THE REMOTE PHONE
YEAH
RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES ARE CHEAPER USUALLY
YEAH
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD FIND THAT TOO FOREIGN
IT'S WHEN WE GET SATELLITE
YEAH
YEAH 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY MATERIAL PRICING INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ME AT THE MOMENT SO
R. THE DOUBLE R.
OR IS THE L
YEAH YELLOW COULD BE AND IT COULD DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HUGE
MM-HMM
I HAD SOMETHING BUT I FORGOT
I DON'T MIND GOING FIRST
YEAH IT'S IN THE SHOULD BE IN THE M PROJECT
YOU KNOW YOU COULD YOU COULD DO IT YOURSELF ACTUALLY
PUT IT IN PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH
SURE
YEAH
OKAY
UM WELL THE FUNCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL AS WHAT UH WE'VE BEEN INFORMED
IS BASICALLY TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET FOR EXAMPLE
SWITCH IT ON SWITCH IT OFF GO TO THIS CHANNEL GO TO CHANNEL NINE TURN THE VOLUME UP ETCETERA
UM SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS IS JUST UM FOR EXAMPLE THE WHAT IT NEEDS TO INCLUDE IT'S THE NUMBERS
YOU KNOW ZERO TO NINE SO YOU CAN MOVE TO A CHANNEL THE POWER BUTTON ON SLASH OFF
THE CHANNEL GOING UP AND DOWN
VOLUME GOING UP AND DOWN AND THEN MUTE
A MUTE FUNCTION
AND THEN FUNCTIONS FOR V. H. S. D. V. D. FOR EXAMPLE PLAY REWIND FAST FORWARD STOP PAUSE ENTER
AND ENTER WOULD BE FOR LIKE YOU KNOW THE MENUS
AND THEN OTHER MENUS FOR D. V. AS WELL AS T. V.
WHETHER THAT MEANS LIKE UM WE CAN GO AND DECIDE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SCREEN THINGS LIKE THAT ALL THE MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS OF MENUS
AND WE CAN DECIDE IF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT UM IF WE WANT TO INCLUDE THAT ON THE REMOTE
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD STAY ON THE T. V. ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE
THESE ARE TWO EXAMPLES
UM AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT IT'S GOT A LOT MORE BUTTONS
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN READ IT BUT IT SAYS STEP GO TO FREEZE
UM SLOW REPEAT PROGRAM MUTE AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE BUTTONS AND SO IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF S ONE EXAMPLE
AND THEN ON THE RIGHT IT'S A LOT MORE SIMPLER IT'S GOT VOLUME IT'S GOT THE PLAY THE LIKE CIRCLE SET WHICH IS PLAY
REWIND BUT IT'S ALSO WHAT IS FAST FORWARD IS ALSO LIKE NEXT ON A MENU
SO YOU HAVE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE D UH DUPLICATING
AND YOU HAVE A MUTE BUTTON AND THEN THE NUMBERS AND THE EJECT AND THE POWER BUTTON
SO THAT GIVES YOU TWO DIFFERENT KINDS A MORE COMPLEX AND MORE SIMPLE VERSION
OKAY
AND THEN LASTLY IT'S JUST THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WANT TO CONSIDER LIKE WHAT FUNCTIONS DO WE WANT IT TO INCLUDE
AND HOW SIMPLE COMPLEX IT SHOULD BE
AND WHAT FUNCTIONS IT NEEDS TO COMPLETE
UH WHAT ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE INSULATION PROCESS 'CAUSE YOU KNOW
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALSO HAS TO BE CONSIDERED AND IT'S GONNA BE HOPEFULLY A ONE TIME THING
WHEN YOU SET IT UP IT SHOULD BE SET TO GO
BUT WE HAVE TO INCLUDE THE FUNCTIONS THAT CAN ALLOW IT TO SET UP I IN THE FIRST PLACE
SO THAT'S IT
MM
LEFT
WAIT
AND THAT MEANING WHAT
OKAY
RIGHT
ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
LOST
S
WAIT IS THAT LIKE YOUR
ERGONOMICS LIKE YOUR HAND MOVEMENTS OR SOMETHING
LIKE
CHANNEL VOLUME POWER
IT'S LIKE IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT
TO JUST SAY WHERE ARE YOU AND THING BEEPS YOU KNOW
YEAH
IT'S KINDA LIKE WHAT THE REMOTE PHONE USED TO DO
YOU KNOW LIKE GO TO THE BASE
YEAH
WORKING DESIGN
HELP ME
WELL HOW MUCH EXTRA WOULD THE ADDITIONAL CHIP BE
IS THAT GONNA PUSH US OVER OUR PRODUCTION COSTS
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S GONNA BE WHAT'S COMMUNICATING WITH THE T. V. BUT THE OTHER BULB I THINK
IS GOOD TO JUST TO INDICATE I'M DOING SOMETHING IT'S SORT OF LIKE A REASSURANCE
YEAH
JUST
WELL SHOULD IT BE LARGER BUTTONS IN GENERAL YOU KNOW LIKE UH THE EXAMPLES THAT I HAD THEY WERE SWI QUITE SMALL
SO SHOULD WE TRY AND GO FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS L LARGER BUTTONS
OVALS
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
I KNOW
YEAH IT'S LIKE BLACK BLACK AND WHITE KIND OF
IT'LL GIVE YOU THE SPORTS
EXCEPT THE ENTIRE SCREEN
YOU CAN PICK SPORTS YOU CAN PICK THE NEWS YOU ENTERTAINMENT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE
YEAH
COMPANY COLOUR BEING YELLOW
MM-HMM
IT'S GONNA MAKE IT NICER
YEAH
WE SHOULD GO FOR THE LOWEST DENOMINATOR
HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED
WELL IT'S CHANNEL ON OFF BUTTON VOLUME MUTE
UM
OH RIGHT YEAH OKAY
TRACKING
BUT YOU GOT A BASE
WELL IF YOU HAVE THE BASE YOU COULD START PUTTING IN A CHARGER AND THEN YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF BATTERY
YEAH
WELL THEN WE COULD IF WE HAVE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN WE CAN START AIMING AT A LIKE ANOTHER KIND OF MORE HANDICAPPED DISABLED UH DEMO DEMOGRAPHIC
WELL
WELL THEN THEN DO YOU PUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION DO YOU PUT THE R LIKE RECEIVER ON THE ACTUAL TELEVISION
IN THE BASE OR IN THE ACTUAL REMOTE
'CAUSE THEN YOU'VE ALREADY GOT REMOTE IN YOUR HAND WHY YOU JUST GONNA SPEAK TO THE REMOTE
WHEREAS IF YOU JUST SPEAK IN GENERAL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE REMOTE IN YOUR HAND AND LIKE TALK AT IT
STILL FIFTEEN MINUTES
UM
WELL DO WE WANNA INCLUDE THE NUMBERS LIKE ZERO THROUGH NINE
CAN WE CONCEIVE OF LEAVING THEM OUT
YEAH LIKE YOU HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE ZERO
WELL I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IF YOU CAN LIKE WELL I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S JUST A WAY OF LEAVING THEM OUT
THE COLOUR BEING YELLOW
AND HOW DO WE
CAN'T MAKE IT ENTIRELY
WELL IF YOU HAVE LIKE A HANG ON
IF YOU HAVE THIS SORT OF STRIP KIND OF DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THE BASE OF IT JUST LIKE YELLOW WITH THE R. R.
RIGHT YEAH
TWO EXAMPLES
YEAH
OH IT'S A YEAH
WELL THE OTHER OPTION IS SORT OF LIKE DOWN AT THE BOTTOM LIKE FARTHER AWAY
YOU JUST HAVE THIS SORT OF BOX INSET WHERE IT'S LIKE THE BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T USE AS MUCH BUT OCCASIONALLY YOU WILL USE
AND SO IT'S LIKE
I DON'T WELL I DON'T KNOW
RIGHT
WELL THAT COULD BE NO YOU COULD JUST DOUBLE UP WITH LIKE THE CHANNEL OR THE VOLUME BUTTONS
CHANNEL IS JUST UP AND DOWN
AND THEN ADD A
YEAH
SO WE JUST HAVE IT LIKE ADD A MENU BUTTON THEN FOR THE VARIOUS THINGS NEEDED
INCLUDING V VOICE RECOGNITION IF WE HAVE ANY LIKE SETTINGS FOR VOICE RECOGNITION NOW
INCLUDED IN THE MENU
DO YOU WANT US TO DO OUR POWERPOINTS NOW OR
I CAN GO
YEAH YOU SHOULD RUN IT
MM YES
YES OKAY SO WE TESTED A HUNDRED SUBJECTS IN OUR LAB AND WE JUST WE WATCHED THEM AND WE ALSO MADE THEM FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE
AND WE FOUND THAT THE USERS ARE NOT TYPICALLY HAPPY WITH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT THINK THEY'RE UGLY
EIGHTY PERCENT WANT THEY'VE ARE WILLING TO SPEND MORE WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR US UM IF WE MAKE IT LOOK FANCIER
AND BASICALLY W WE JUST NEED SOMETHING THAT REALLY I MEAN THERE'S SOME OTHER POINTS UP THERE BUT THEY IT NEEDS TO BE SNAZZY AND IT BUT YET SIMPLE
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO
AND WE NEED WE NEED IT TO BE SIMPLE YET IT NEEDS TO BE HIGH TECH LOOKING
SO
LIKE
THEY LIKE I GUESS USE THE BUTTONS A LOT
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
IT'S FROM MY UH RESEARCH
MY TEAM WASN'T VERY CLEAR
THAT'S OKAY
I I THINK IT'S LIKE THE ENGINEERING VERSUS USER
WHEREAS LIKE THE ENGINEERING SHE SHOWED THAT THE ENGINEERING ONES ARE MORE COMPLEX AND USERS DON'T REALLY NEED ALL OF THE BUTTONS THAT ARE CONTAINED ON THERE
BECAUSE THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS REALLY
GOOD POINT
IT'S A NECESSARY EVIL
MM-HMM
AND SO PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY TYPICALLY LOSE IT AS YOU YOURSELF KNOW BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY LOSE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL ALL THE TIME
MUCH LIKE ANY SMALL APPLIANCE LIKE A CELLPHONE AND THEY WE NEED SOMETHING SIMPLE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE
WELL THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAY THAT IT'S JUST TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW ONE
AND WE DON'T WANT TO GO WE DON'T WANT TO VARY TOO FAR FROM THE NORMAL STANDARD REMOTE
BUT I MEAN THEY DO NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IT AND R. S. I. I'M NOT VERY SURE WHAT THAT IS
YES IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL WORLD
SH
UH POSSIBLY
UH YEAH THAT'S WHAT MY WEB SITE SAID I
DON'T KNOW
YEAH I WOULD ASSUME SO
I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW IT AS REMOTE CONTROL EXPERTS
BUT ALSO S SO THE CHANNEL
THE VOLUME AND THE POWER BUTTONS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ON OUR COMPANY WEBSITE YOU CAN FIND LIKE THE SPECIFIC STATISTICS CONCERNING TO HOW MUCH EACH BUTTON IS USED
BUT THOSE ARE THE DEFINITELY THE TOP ONES
YES
AND SO PERSONALLY I THINK THAT WE NEED A MODERN EYE CATCHING DESIGN BUT IT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE SIMPLE
SO SAYING FROM Y YOUR SLIDE YOUR PRESENTATION THE ENGINEERING VERSUS THE USER SPECIFIED REMOTES I THINK THAT WE SHOULD GO WITH SOMETHING THAT'S MORE USER FRIENDLY
WHERE THE ENGINEERING ONES THE BOXES TEND TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT REALLY IS
UM THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PRODUCT REALLY NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS TO LIKE WHAT TYPE OF BUTTONS DO WE REALLY NEED ON IT
AND IT NEEDS TO BE OPEN TO A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMERS SO EVEN THOUGH WE NEED A SMALL NUMBER OF BUTTONS
WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE IN LIKE ARE MOST PEOPLE GOING TO BE USING IT FOR A D. V. D. PLAYER
A TIVO WHAT WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE USING IT FOR AS WELL AS THE AGE RANGE
SO WE NEED A HIP BUT NOT A CORNY MARKETING SCHEME FOR PROMOTING OUR PRODUCT
AND ALSO WE FOUND OUR TEAM FOUND THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION IS IT'S LIKE AN UP AND COMING THING THEY REALLY CONSUMERS ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN IT
AND SINCE OUR FINDINGS FOUND THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE MONEY FOR A REMOTE FOR IT TO BE MORE HIGH CLASS WE COULD CONSIDER IT
I GUESS SO YEAH
YEAH I GUESS WE CAN INTERPRET IT LIKE WE CAN JUST TRY OUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPEECH RECOGNITION WITHIN OUR REMOTE PROGRAMME
OH THAT'S FINE
WHAT EXACTLY IS A SMART CHIP
SO WHAT EXACTLY WE ARE LOOKING AT IS THIS LIKE THE FRONT OF THE REMOTE
OH OKAY
LIKE THAT WE KNOW THE BATTERY'S WORKING
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH AND THAT'S GOOD
WE SHOULD MAKE IT GLOW IN THE DARK
MM 'KAY
I THINK WE SHOULD
LIKE I THINK THAT WOULD BE IN A AS IN LIKE IN FOR THE DESIGN SORRY UM
I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GO WITH BUTTONS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE A NORMAL REMOTE 'CAUSE MOST REMOTES HAVE SMALL SQUARE BUTTONS
I THINK WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE MAYBE BIGGER AND ROUND LIKE BUBBLES
WHAT IS IT
LIKE RUNNING ALONG THE BOTTOM
WAIT IS IT LIKE THE WEATHER CHANNEL WHERE IT'S GOT LIKE THE TICKER RUNNING ON THE BOTTOM OR SOMETHING
SO IT'S LIKE A SEPARATE CHANNEL FROM LIKE WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING
OKAY
NO KIDS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO USE A REMOTE I WOULD THINK
THEY GOTTA CHANGE BETWEEN DISNEY CHANNEL CARTOON NETWORK
YEAH I THINK WE NEED IT ALL
UM I WOULD SAY WE SHOULD SAY DUMBER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
YEAH
AND CHANNEL
YEAH
THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES
YEAH
SURE YEAH
I NEED WE WE NEED A LIKE HOMING DEVICE
BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR A REMOTE THAT'S MORE HIGH TECH
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE'LL REALLY GO FOR THAT THOUGH
BECAUSE
YEAH
I WOULD THINK SO BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE TO DEVELOP A BASE
HMM
RIGHT
DO W
WELL TH THERE'S THE PEOPLE WHO DESIRE SPEECH RECOGNITION THERE'S THE DIFFERENT DEMOG DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE DIFFERENT DESIRES I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS GE
IT WOULDN'T COPY ONTO THE THE THING 'CAUSE IT'S BLACK BUT ALL THE DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS HAVE DIFFERENT DESIRES FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO BASICALLY OLDER PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE
IT'S REALLY THE PEOPLE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE
I FEEL THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY WATCH A LOT OF T. V. THOUGH
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT GET ADDICTED TO SOAP OPERAS AND
JUST SITCOMS AND STUFF
RIGHT
SO
RIGHT
YEAH
WAIT ON THE REMOTE ITSELF
WELL WE DEFINITELY NEED THOSE
YEAH
YOU DEFINITELY NEED
WAIT
I FEEL LIKE A YE I FEEL LIKE A YELLOW ONE WOULD BE TOO GARISH
OR PUT LIKE STRIPES OH YEAH YELLOW LIGHTS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AUDI AUDIO SETTINGS AND SCREEN SETTINGS WE NEED THOSE LIKE AUDIO SETTINGS MONO STEREO
PITCH SCREEN SETTINGS LIKE BRIGHTNESS COLOUR OR DO WE JUST WANT THAT ACCESSED ACCESSED FROM THE TELEVISION ITSELF
YEAH 'CAUSE WE NEED TO WE DEFINITELY NEED TO HAVE BUTTONS FOR LIKE SUB TITLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
IT'S 'CAUSE THE FOREIGN FILM MARKET IS EXPANDING AND STUFF
AND LIKE ON TELEVISION LIKE I KNOW F K LIVING IN LOS ANGELES IT'S TONS OF SPANISH NETWORK TELEVISION IF IT HAS ENGLISH SUB TITLES IT'S DEFINITELY HELPFUL
SO WE NEED UP DOWN AND SIDE TO SIDE BUTTONS
YEAH OKAY
OKAY YEAH
SUCH AS YEAH THE ONE THE ONE OVER THERE ON THE LEFT THE ENGINEERING CENTRED ONE
OOH I JUST GOT AN IDEA FOR A DESIGN
OKAY
HI TEAM
HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD LUNCH
OKAY WE'RE BACK FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
UM LET'S GET STARTED
'KAY HERE IS THE AGENDA FOR TODAY'S MEETING
UM WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT AND I'M GONNA KEEP THE MINUTES AS PROJECT MANAGER
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS ONE FROM EACH OF YOU AGAIN
AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO COME TO DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA CLOSE IT UP
AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES AGAIN
'KAY AND JUST TO REITERATE UM AFTER THIS MEETING THE TEAM WILL REACH A DECISION ON THE CONCEPTS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
LET'S GO AHEAD AND START OFF WITH YOUR PRESENTATIONS
WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST
OKAY
UM COURTNEY WOULD YOU MIND STARTING US OFF
OKAY
TREND WATCHING
'KAY
MM 'KAY
MM
MM
RIGHT
YES
RIGHT
RIGHT
PEOPLE DON'T BUY A NEW REMOTE EVERY SO OFTEN
OKAY
HMM
VERY GOOD
I LIKE IT
OKAY READY FOR THE NEXT SLIDE
OP MM 'KAY
GREAT
GREAT PRESENTATION
READY
'KAY
WHICH ONE IS IT
INTERFACE CONCEPTS NEW
Y
'KAY
SORRY
OH OKAY
OH THERE WE GO
SURE
MM 'KAY
MM
MM
OKAY
OKAY
'KAY
NO
MM
OR I LIKE YOU KNOW THE BLACK FINISH OR THE SILVER FINISH OR WHATEVER
GOOD LORD
OKAY
READY
OH YEAH
OKAY
GREAT JOB
OKAY
WHAT'S THE TITLE
GOT IT
HMM
INTERESTING
MM
'KAY
NO OKAY
MM
HMM
OKAY
ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR THOSE INFORMATIVE PRESENTATIONS
LET'S GO BACK TO UM NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS
WHERE WERE WE
SURE
MM
RIGHT
RIGHT
MM
HMM
PROGRAMME
IF IT'S WITHIN OUR PRICE TO GET THAT KIND OF CHIP THAT WOULD YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY
HMM
MM
HMM
OKAY THAT KIND OF BRINGS US TO THIS LET'S LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DECIDE WHAT KIND OF ENERGY SOURCE WE WANT TO HAVE FIRST AND FOREMOST
UM
DO WE WANNA GO FOR BATTERIES OR A STAND LIKE THE ONE THAT WE SAW ILLUSTRATED EARLIER
THE BASE THE CHARGING BASE WITH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
HMM
YEAH AND WE DON'T HAVE MULTIPLE THINGS THAT IT HAS TO CONTROL IT JUST HAS TO CONTROL THE T. V.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE A HUGE UNIVERSAL REMOTE
WHAT SIZE BATTERY AND
RIGHT
I AGREE IT'S EITHER GONNA BE BIGGER WITH A BASE OR SMALLER WITH JUST
A BATTERY LIKE THIS GUY
ALRIGHT SO WHAT DIRECTION DO YOU WANT TO GO IN
YOU WANNA VOTE
I'M KIND OF I'M KIND OF LEANING IN THE DIRECTION OF THIS KIND OF
BIGGER AND THE BASE
THAT JUST SEEMS SO CLUNKY AND
OKAY
HMM
OKAY SO WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL DO WE WANT TO BE MADE OUT OF
NO
OH WHAT DID YOU OH SORRY GO AHEAD
RIGHT
WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND
MM
I I THINK WE SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON ONE DESIGN AND ONE CONCEPT RIGHT NOW
REMOTES
IF THIS WAS A SUCCESSFUL REMOTE WE MIGHT THEN PRODUCE A HIGHER END VERSION OF IT I THINK
OKAY SO WE WANNA GO FOR PLASTIC OR WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND FOR MATERIALS
HMM
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
THEY COULD BUY CASES MAYBE
IF THEY WANTED
I THINK IT'S GOOD TO SELL A BASIC THING AND THEN SELL
OPTIONS
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY AND WHAT KIND OF CHIP WOULD WE NEED FOR THIS GUY
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO VOICE I THINK WE SHOULD JUST DO UM THE RECOGNITION FOR WHEN IT'S LOST YOU KNOW
COULD WE YEAH
HMM
RIGHT
OH DEAR
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE VOICE ACTIVATED IN THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD SAY CHANNEL UP AND IT WOULD WORK RIGHT
JUST A OKAY ALRIGHT
NO
MM 'KAY
UH AND WHAT SIZE BATTERIES DOUBLE A. TRIPLE A.
TWO
COULD IT RUN OFF OF TWO
THEY'RE MORE EXPENSIVE THOUGH TOO
MM
THOUGHTS ANYBODY
OKAY
YEAH
ALRIGHT
OKAY
SO WE'VE COVERED THAT FIRST CATEGORY USER INTERFACE CONCEPT MEANING DESIGN
OKAY
I KI I KIND OF LIKE YOUR IDEA ABOUT THE RETRO PHONE DIAL AND THAT THE CENTRAL BUTTON COULD HAVE MAYBE OUR LOGO ON IT
IT MIGHT BE THE FOUR WAY SCROLL TOO
I MEAN IF YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
I THINK SO
YEAH I LIKE THAT
'KAY
MM
CAN WE
SO THAT YOU'RE JUST NOT HOLDING IT AND IT CHANGES THE CHAN
MM
YEAH
HMM
'KAY ANY OTHER IDEAS
OH YEAH
LATEX COVERS
W
I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT ON A B BUTTON ITSELF THOUGH
BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO CHANGE THE COVERS I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THE ON OFF BUTTON
SOMETHING SOME THE MENU BUTTON I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA PUT OUR COMPANY LOGO ON THERE AND SOMEBODY COULD JUST GET
ANOTHER ONE
ARE THEY ALL GONNA HAVE OUR COMPANY LOGO ON THEM
EVERY COVER
YEAH
IF WE WANT IT TO BE VISIBLE AND
UM ARE ALL THOSE THOSE ONE THAT YOU SHOWED WHERE THEY WERE UM S MET SILVER METALLIC LOOKING
BUT THOSE ARE PLASTIC RIGHT
THEY'RE NOT TITANIUM
I KIND OF LIKE THAT LOOK
UH BUT OR IF IT WAS REALLY YEAH FOR THE BASE OR IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE RETRO LOOK
I THINK LIKE A REALLY SHINY BLACK WOULD BE COOL
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
GUN METAL GRAY
THERE YOU GO GUN METAL GRAY
WHY
MM
RIGHT
ON THE BACK
IT D VISIBLE VISIBILITY THOUGH 'CAUSE IF IT WAS ONLY ON THE BACK REALLY THE ONLY TIME YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT IS WHEN YOU DROP IT OR WHEN YOU'RE CHANGING THE BATTERY
I CAN FIND IT AGAIN
OKAY
AND YOURS WAS CALLED INTERFACE CONCEPT
THIS ONE
WELL FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T GET IT TO JUST GO TO THAT SLIDE DIRECTLY
MM
OKAY YES YES
OKAY
LIKE A LITTLE CUT OUT KIND OF
OKAY
ANYBODY SEE ANYTHING THAT THEY LIKED IN THESE ONES
MM
MM
YELLOW I LIKE THAT IDEA
MM
MM
I LIKE THE YELLOW ILLUMINATION IDEA VERY GOOD
OKAY
ANY OTHER IDEAS OR THOUGHTS
WE ALL SEEM TO BE FAIRLY IN AGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT WE WANNA DO WITH THIS PROJECT SO
'KAY
I THINK THERE WILL BE TIME FOR THAT LATER
I'M GUESSING
'KAY WELL WE'RE GONNA WRAP THIS UP
UM NEXT MEETING IS GONNA START IN THIRTY MINUTES
AND HERE'S WHAT WE'RE EACH OF US GOING TO DO
THE I. D. IS GOING TO DO THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN THE U. I. D. THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF I MEAN THE FINAL SAY ON WHAT BUTTONS GET PUT WE'LL ALL TALK ABOUT IT
BUT I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO RIGHT
I GUESS
'KAY
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO SOME PRODUCT EVALUATION
OKAY AND RIGHT NOW THE I. D. AND U. I. D. YOU TWO ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE USING MODELLING CLAY
YEAH
OKAY AND YOU SHOULD ALL BE GETTING AN EMAIL PRETTY SOON
ALRIGHT
WELL THANK YOU FOR A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING
JUST TRYING TO MOVE MINE RIGHT NOW
THEY WANT EVERYTHING BUT SIMPLY
OKAY
YEAH TH
I I CAN
I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THAT ISSUE I THINK WITH UH MY PRESENTATION
OKAY
MINE WILL ALWAYS READ COPY OF SOMETHING OR OTHER
I I COPIED MINE BEFORE I SENT IT OVER
HMM
OKAY MY TURN
WHOO
IT'LL BE COPY OF COMPONENT DESIGN
YEAH
TH THAT LOOKS LIKE IT
'KAY
SO BASIC REMOTE OPERATION RUNS AS FOLLOWS PRESS BUTTON MAKES CONNECTION WITH THE POWER SOURCE AND THE REST OF THE CIRCUIT
CHIP SENSES THE CONNECTION CHIP PRODUCES A MORSE CODE INFRA RED SIGNAL SPECIFIC TO THAT BUTTON
SO YOU PRESS THE BUTTON IT PRODUCES UH A SIGNAL THAT'S ENCODED SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT BUTTON
TRANSISTORS AMPLIFY THAT SIGNAL AND IT GOES TO THE T. V. 'S CENTRE WHICH INTERPRETS THE SIGNAL RESPONSE ACCORDINGLY CHANGES CHANNEL ETCETERA
SO THAT BEING SAID NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
FINDINGS OH WHICH WERE THE REQUIRED MATERIALS FOR THE BASIC INTERNAL CONSTRUCTION SO ALL THE REALLY SIMPLISTIC FUNCTIONS THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED WE NEED RUBBER FOR BUTTONS
ALUMINIUM FOR BATTERY Y CONTACTS INTEGRATED CIRCUIT WHICH CONSISTS OF A DIODE TRANSISTOR
RESONATOR RESISTORS AND A CAPACITATOR ALL THOSE BASIC THINGS THAT MAKE A CIRCUIT FUNCTION
UM FIBREGLASS AND THIN COPPER WIRE TO CREATE THE ACTUAL CIRCUIT BOARD ITSELF
AN L. E. D. WHICH IS A LIGHT EMITTING DIODE UM CONTACT DISCS FOR THE BUTTONS
PLASTIC FOR THE CASING AND A POWER SOURCE WHATEVER POWER SOURCE WE'VE ACTUALLY DETERMINED WE WANT
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
THANK YOU
UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES UH TO SAVE MONEY FOR THE COMPONENTS THE REMOTE SHOULD BE MASS PRODUCED AND BASIC MATERIALS SHOULD BE BOUGHT EN MASSE
UM IF WE FIND ANOTHER COMPANY WHO CAN PRODUCE THE REQUIRED CHIPS CASING L. E. D.
ANY ADDITIONAL MATERIALS WE DECIDE WE REQUIRE AT A LESS EXPENSIVE RATE THAN WE OURSELVES ARE PRODUCING WE SHOULD GO FOR IT
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
UM JUST TALKING TO THE UM MANUFACTURING DIVISION
THEY SUGGESTED POWER OPTIONS SOLAR CELLS HAND DYNAMO AND KINETIC POWER SO YOU SHAKE IT AND IT INCREASES THE POWER
UM I'M NOT SURE HOW THE HAND DYNAMO WORKS THEY HAVE YET TO GET BACK TO ME ON THAT
SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
SUGGESTED CASING OPTIONS
OKAY
WE CAN OFFER OPTIONS FOR CASING SUCH AS STRAIGHT CURVED DOUBLE CURVED YOU KNOW VERY SPECIFIC TO THE CUSTOMER
OPTIONS FOR MATERIALS PLASTIC RUBBER TITANIUM WOOD
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S GONNA GO FOR A WOOD ONE BECAUSE SPLINTERS
YEAH
UM CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS DO APPLY HERE THOUGH
UH LATEX YOU CAN'T DO SOLAR POWER WITH A LATEX ONE
SO IF THEY WANT SOME A SOFT SQUISHY RUBBER THEY CAN'T HAVE THE SOLAR POWERED OPTION
DOUBLE CURVED YOU CAN'T DO TITANIUM
UM THAT WOULD BE TWO CURVATURES SO IT WOULD ACTUALLY IF YOU THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND YOU CURVE HERE AND YOU CURVE HERE
SO YOU COULD HAVE TWO CURVES THAT MATCH THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND TO MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD
NOW IF YOU WANTED THAT YOU CAN'T DO TITANIUM
AND UH SO YOU FUNCTIONS WHAT FOR THE BUTTONS SCROLLING FUNCTION COULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO US INSTEAD OF ACTUAL BUTTONS THEMSELVES
I THINK I HAVE ONE MORE SLIDE
NO I DIDN'T
UM THE MANUFACTURING DIVISION ALSO HAS SAID THAT UM THEY HAVE SEVERAL TYPES OF CHIPS AND THEY'VE JUST DEVELOPED A SAMPLE SENSOR OR SAMPLE SPEAKER CHIP
WHICH WE COULD UTILISE
UM PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP AND SCROLL REQUIRES MORE COMPLICATED CHIP
SO DEPENDS ON WHAT WE DECIDE WE WANNA DO
IN ADDITION TO THAT IF WE'RE OFFERING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO THE CUSTOMER FOR PRODUCING THEIR REMOTE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MULTIPLES OF EACH TYPE
LIKE A DOUBLE CURVED IN RUBBER UM YOU KNOW EACH OPTION SHOULD HAVE A CERTAIN SELECT NUMBER PRODUCED WITH ALL THOSE OPTIONS
SO WE'LL HAVE TO MIX IT UP MAKE SURE WE PRODUCE ENOUGH OF EVERYONE
BUT THAT COULD ALSO DRIVE UP THE PRICE OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE ITSELF IF THEY KNOW THAT WE ONLY PRODUCED FIVE THOUSAND YOU KNOW DOUBLE CURVED WOODEN REMOTES
AND THAT'S ALL I GOT
WELL WE ARE MAKING THE CHIP
SO I MEAN
BUT I GUESS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT W WHAT OUR PRODUCTION COST IS FOR THE CHIP ITSELF ANYWAY
YEAH
YEAH
I I THOUGHT OFFERING SOME OF THOSE OPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT MATERIALS THAT IT COULD BE MADE OF DIFFERENT
YOU KNOW I THINK WE'D HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE POWER OPTIONS MAYBE
SO THAT WE COULD REDUCE COST
YEAH
OKAY
I THINK THE P
THAT'S TRUE
IF WE DO A VOICE ACTIVATED LOCATOR THOUGH WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT A MORE SUBSTANTIAL CHIP
SO
HONESTLY I THINK THE CUSTOMER WOULD BE KIND OF IRRITATED BY THE FACT THAT IT HAS A BASE IF WE DID DO A NICE SMALL COMPACT
MM YEAH
YEAH
'KAY SO
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IF YOU FORGET TO TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND IT GOES IN WASH
YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS
I'VE HAD THREE WATCHES GO THAT WAY TOO
PIECES EVERYWHERE
WELL WE HAVE LOTS OF OPTIONS
I DON'T THINK WOOD IS A VIABLE OPTION
HOWEVER WELL WE ONLY WANNA SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO RIGHT
'CAUSE I WAS THINKING IF WE WANTED TO GET THE HIGH IN MARKET THEN YOU COULD PRODUCE A FEW IN TITANIUM MAKE THEM A RARITY SO TO SPEAK
YEAH
WELL THE ORIGINAL
OKAY
YEAH
GOOD PLAN
HONESTLY I'D RECOMMEND LIKE UM UH SINCE WE'RE GOING WITH BATTERIES INSTEAD OF SOLAR POWER I'D RECOMMEND MAYBE A UH SOFT LIKE LATEX
BECAUSE WE COULD PRODUCE YOU KNOW HOW CELLPHONES HAVE THOSE OVERLAYS THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR
WE COULD DO UH ONE THAT FITS IN WITH THE TRENDS OF THE YEAR SO BECAUSE THIS YEAR IS ALL FRUIT GOD ONLY KNOWS WHY
UM WE COULD DO F A CHERRY COVER FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN I IF NEXT YEAR IS STRIPES OR SOLIDS YOU KNOW
THEY COULD COME BACK
AND BUY THE EXTRA CASE
SO WE COULD DO LIKE A B A HARD BASE PLASTIC AND THEN WE COULD GIVE TWO LATEX COVERS TO START
HOW COMPLICATED ARE WE GONNA GO WITH THE VOICE ACTIVATED
WELL WE COULD GIVE IT A SPECIFIC CODE YOU KNOW REMOTE MISSING
YEAH SEE THAT WOULD JUST IRRITATE ME
SO I THINK HAVING A KEY PHRASE IS MUCH BETTER
NO
THAT WOULD BE LIKE A MID CLASS UM YEAH
SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO FOR
WELL IF THEY'VE JUST DEVELOPED THE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER IT'S A BRAND NEW CHIP
WHY NOT INTRODUCE IT IN THIS WAY
I THINK WELL WE COULD D R DO TWO OR WE COULD DO ONE SMALL LITHIUM
'CAUSE YOU KNOW THE LITHIUM BATTERIES ARE DOING QUITE WELL IN MOST OTHER ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS RIGHT
SO THEY'RE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE NOW
AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LONGER BATTERY LIFE THAN MOST BATTERIES
BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE TO REPLACE IT EVERY FIVE YEARS
WELL HOW ABOUT A INITIAL YOU GET ONE BATTERY WHEN YOU BUY IT 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE WE CAN GET THEM PRETTY CHEAP ON BULK
YEAH
IN THE SAMPLE ONES THAT YOU SHOWED US THERE WAS ONE THAT HAD THE SCROLL BUTTONS ON THE SIDE
WHICH I THINK IF WE MAKE IT CURVED LIKE A HAND LIKE A HAND SHAPE LIKE IF WE PUT THE THE SCROLL BUTTON ON THE SIDE THAT COULD BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL
WELL IF IT'S JUST UP AND DOWN
VOLUME OR CHANNEL
I DON'T KNOW
MM YEAH
WE SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE IT THAT YOU HAVE TO DEPRESS IT TO ACTIVATE IT THEN
'CAUSE OTH OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT JUST HOLDING IT AND GOING LIKE THIS YOU KNOW
OKAY
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT LOGO ALWAYS STICKS OUT WHEN WE PUT THE LATEX COVERS ON
SO WE'LL HAVE TO LIKE HAVE A LITTLE SQUARE OR SOMETHING SO THAT THE OUR LOGO'S AVAILABLE
YEAH I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST BE ICKY
SO I THINK MAYBE PUTTING IT ON A BUTTON IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA
FOR OUR BASE ONE
IT'LL WEAR OFF
THERE'S NOTHING SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO PUT THE LOGO ON THE FRONT OF THE ACTUAL
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS WE'RE USING A LATEX OVERLAY SO IT ACTUALLY WOULD GO OVER TOP OF EVERYTHING AND HAVE HOLES FOR THE BUTTONS
SO I WAS THINKING MAYBE INSTEAD OF DOING THAT WHAT WE COULD DO IS LEAVE A SPACE FOR WHERE THE LOGO SHOULD BE
YEAH
GREAT
PLAY DOH
WONDERFUL
OOH
OKAY HANG ON
SEE IF IT'S THERE
I DON'T KNOW
HANG ON
INTERFACE CONCEPTS NO
EITHER REFRESH IT OR IT SH OH WAIT MAYBE I DIDN'T PUT IT THERE
HANG ON
SORRY HANG ON
DON'T KNOW
OKAY
OKAY UM LOOKING AT THE INTERFACE CONCEPT IT'S GONNA BE MOSTLY EXAMPLES OF POSSIBILITIES OF WHERE WE CAN GO WITH THIS
UH IF YOU WANNA START THE NEXT SLIDE
UM UH CAN'T REALLY SEE BUT THERE'S TWO POSSIBLE WAYS ON THE R LEFT
IF YOU SEE ON TH ON THE SIDES OF OF THE REMOTE YOU HAVE THE SORT OF SCROLL DOWN SO YOU HAVE THAT OPTION RIGHT THERE
AND THEN ALSO THERE'S THE IDEA OF THE BASE
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE AN IDEA THERE
AND THEN ON THE RIGHT WE HAVE WHAT'S REALLY BIG TREND RIGHT NOW IT'S THE IPOD
IT'S BECOMING REALLY AND SO YOU HAVE THIS SORT OF VERY VERY SIMPLISTIC MENU SECTION UH WITH THE ROUND BUTTONS
AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE THE BOTH KIND OF TRENDY AND HIP BUT ALSO VERY SLEEK AND
UM AND VERY SIMPLE BUT TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED
SO IF YOU WANTED TO DO THAT TH IF WE COULD FIND A WAY OF SORT OF LIKE USING THAT IDEA IN A REMOTE CONTROL THEN SORT OF
LOOK INTO IT BUT ANYWAY NEXT
UM THERE'S THE IDEA OF LIKE BEING ABLE TO DO IT BY FEEL AS WELL AS BY UM BY SIGHT
YOU'D YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN THE DARK YOU DON'T WANNA BE LOOKING AT THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND THE PICTURE PARTICULARLY IS POINTING OUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP VOLUME BUTTON IT'S A V.
AND SO YO YOU'RE KIND OF FEELING A V. LIKE VOLUME UP
WHAT IT REALLY IS IS A V. AND WHAT IT YOU THINK IT IS IS DOWN BECAUSE THE DOWN ARROW
AND SO IT'S LIKE A SORT OF A CRITICISM YOU'D PROBABLY TURN THAT O THE OTHER WAY UP
UM BUT THEN YOU HAVE YOU COULD EITHER DO IT BY RAISED TYPE WHICH COULD BE YOU KNOW IFFY UM SORT OF OLD FASHIONED IN A WAY
EITHER THAT OR JUST HAVE IT BY SHAPE FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC TRIANGULAR SHAPE THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE UP AND DOWN ARROW
AND THEN THE ROUND ONES YOU SORT OF FEEL BY YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SECOND ONE DOWN THAT SORT OF THING
SO IT'S SORT OF LOOKING INTO HOW WE WANTED T TO DO IT BY FEEL
OKAY
UM THIS IS SORT OF AN EXAMPLE OF GOING FOR A S CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC
UM THIS IS PARTICULARLY GEARED TOWARDS CHILDREN
UM IT'S VERY CUTE AND WE COULD PROBABLY CHANGE IT TO YELLOW BRIGHT YELLOW FOR LIKE A THE FOR THE COMPANY LOGO
UM AND YOU HAVE THE SHAPES AND IT'S VERY SIMPLISTIC AND FRIENDLY LOOKING
UM AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IS JUST TO PRO BE AB YOU PROGRAM CERTAIN
CHANNELS THAT ONLY THESE CHILDREN WOULD WATCH SO IT'S LIKE THEY CH WATCH YOU KNOW THE C. BEEBIES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH KEEP THEM AWAY FROM OTHER CHANNELS
SO THAT'S LIKE ANOTHER AR UM I MEAN THESE ARE THREE EXAMPLES SORT OF LOOKING AT IT
YOU HAVE THE WIDER SECTION FOR THE MAIN CONTROLS THERE
UH YOU COULD SEE HOW MANY BUTTONS THERE ARE
AND THEN ON THE LEFT YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE ROUND BUTTONS AND A SIMPLER DESIGN
ON THE BOTTOM WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T NEED THAT BECAUSE IT'S MORE FOR LIKE A D. V. D. FUNCTION WHICH WE ARE NOT GONNA BE USING
UM
SO AGAIN IT'S SORT OF LIKE JUST GIVE YOU IDEAS AND THEN DOWN AT THE BOTTOM YOU HAVE THE LOGOS AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COULD PUT THE R. R.
REAL REACTION
AND THEN FINALLY THESE ARE LIKE THE SORT OF SAME EXAMPLES BUT ALSO SOME MORE JUST POSSIBILITIES THAT WE COULD GO WITH
NONE OF THEM I'M PARTICULARLY KEEN ON BY THE WAY
BUT IT'S SORT OF LIKE JUST TAKING ASPECTS OUT OF THAT AND SAYING
WELL OUT OF THIS ONE WE LIKE YOU KNOW THE ROUND SECTION OF UM B OR WE'D LIKE THE THE BUTTON SIZE ON THIS
RIGHT
THAT'S IT
RIGHT
LET ME JUST ADD ONE MORE THING THAT I COULDN'T SAY BEFORE AND THAT'S JUST THAT THERE'S THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED ON THE VOICE RECOGNITION
UM
RIGHT EXCEPT THAT IT'S SORT OF ODD AND I'M NO NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY THEY ARE EXPLAINING IT IN THE WAY THEY ARE
UM THERE'S A SAMPLE SENSOR AND THERE'S A SAMPLE SPEAKER UNIT FOR SO
YOU WOULD SAY LIKE GOOD MORNING COFFEEMAKER AND IT WOULD RESPOND GOOD MORNING JILL BUT
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW IT'S GONNA WORK 'CAUSE DO YOU PROGRAMME DO WE PROGRAM THE RESPONSES AND THE QUESTIONS
SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE USER THEN HAS TO ASK THE SPECIFIC QUESTION AND CAN'T CHANGE IT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE RECOGNISED
OR CAN IT BE ALTERED IN A CERTAIN WAY OR DOES THE ACTUALLY USER PROGRAM IT TO SAY A CHANNEL MEANS THIS
RIGHT SO IT'S GOT LIKE A LIMITED MEMORY AND PROGRAMME IT
SO IT'S SORT OF IFFY BUT THAT'S KIND OF WHAT YOU'D SAY
I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE FIRST I WANNA KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE BEFORE 'CAUSE IF IT'S SOMETHING REALLY REALLY SMALL
THEN IT'S SORT OF HARDER TO IMAGINE A BASE FOR IT THAT WAS P QUITE A S SUBSTANTIAL SIZE SORT OF STANDING UP
RIGHT
WELL THE OTHER THING IS LIKE EVEN IF IT'S GOT A FEW BUTTONS SO WE WANT IT TO BE BIGGER THAN THIS
'CAUSE IT STILL FITS IN YOUR HAND SO YOU STILL WANTED SOMETHING THAT'S COMFORTABLE AND SUBSTANTIAL BUT NOT NECESSARILY FULL OF BUTTONS
ARE YOU GONNA LOSE IT EASIER
YEAH
SO I THAT'S THE OTHER THING IT'S LIKE
YOU KNOW
ARE WE GONNA HAVE CERTAIN CHIPS THAT ARE GONNA REQUIRE BIGGER SIZE PERIOD
BUT LIKE YOU KNOW IF WE GET MORE COMPLICATED THEN IT'S GONNA V BE HAVE TO BE BIGGER TO JUST ACCOMMODATE THE CHIP SIZE
SO WE SH
YEAH
I'M A AWAY FROM
THE BASE
YEAH
SMALLER AND SMALLER YEAH YEAH YEAH
YOU'RE KIDDING
OH WATCHES I'VE BUT I'VE NEVER WASHED A CELL PHONE
WELL TITANIUM S I WAS SAYING THAT TITANIUM IF WE'RE BEING RESTRICTED THEN
I WOULD PROBABLY LEAN AWAY FROM THAT
YEAH
THAT'LL YEAH EXACTLY
THE SELLING POINT YEAH
ARE WE RESTRICTED BY THIS
TWENTY FIVE EUROS
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE WHEN IT LEAVES OUR SALESROOM THEN IT'S ALL GONNA BE CHERRY COLOURED OR IS IT GONNA BE THE KINDA THING WHERE PEOPLE COME BACK AND SWAP IT
OKAY
THE WHAT THE TOP FACE RIGHT
YEAH
A TRACKER YEAH
WELL MY LITTLE SISTER GOT FOR CHRISTMAS SHE GOT ONE OF THOSE KEY FINDERS THAT'S LIKE A KEY RING
AND YOU HAVE TO WHISTLE IN A CERTAIN FREQUENCY FOR IT TO WORK
AND THEN SHE WOULD LAUGH AND IT WOULD START GOING OFF IN HER PURSE AND YOU COULDN'T TURN IT OFF
SO IT BECAME HIGHLY IRRITATING
BUT THEN IT
HMM
OKAY
WELL THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE ENERGY IS NEEDED
AS LONG AS WE SELL IT WITH IT
RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT
WHAT'S IT GONNA YEAH WHAT'S IT GONNA LOOK LIKE
UM
WELL MY ISSUE WITH THAT IS IF IT GOT TOO BIG THOUGH 'CAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE CIRCLE AND THE BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE
THEN IS IT GONNA GET WIDER THAN YOUR YOUR HANDS ARE BECAUSE W AND THEN WOULD THE BUTTONS BE TOO SMALL IF IT WAS ENOUGH TO FIT ON IT
YEAH
BUT IS THAT FOR WHICH
DO WE HAVE BOTH SIDES
WELL THE OTHER OPTION IS IN INSTEAD OF A SCROLL YOU JUST HAVE THE BUTTONS UP ON THE SIDE WHICH ARE ON THE SIDE
UM WHAT COLOUR
WELL I SORT OF LIKE HAVING THE A YELLOW STRIP AT THE BOTTOM WITH THE R. R. LIKE THAT
AND THAT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
WHICH BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH
I'M JUST REALLY WARY OF THE PUTTING ANYTHING ON A BUTTON
WHAT'S THE BUTTON WELL W W THEN WHAT'S THE BUTTON DO AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS WHAT THE BUTTON DOES
I GUESS
JUST LOOKING AT EXAMPLES Y YOU JUST DON'T EVER SEE THE LOGO ON A BUTTON IT'S ALWAYS ON THE ACTUAL CASING
BUT YOU DON'T BUT UH YEAH YOU DON'T SEE IT
WELL HANG ON
THE OTHER OPTION IS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE IT BUT IT'S LIKE IF
YEAH IT'S LIKE THE SECOND TO LAST SLIDE
INTERFACE YEAH
YEAH
UM
OKAY IT'S THE VERY RIGHT ONE
YOU SEE AT THE BOTTOM IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO SEE BUT YOU HAVE LIKE A D SORT OF S DIVISION BETWEEN THE BOTTOM LIKE
WHERE THE LOGO IS AND IF WE HAVE THE REPLACEABLE SECTION IT'S LIKE THE TOP
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REPLACE THE ENTIRE TOP
AND SO YOU HAVE THAT ONE PIECE THAT STAYS AND THE REST JUST SORT OF CLIPS IN
IF C YOU ENVISIONING IT
AND SO THAT STAYS THE SAME WHEN YOU HAVE THE LOGO AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS S SLIP THAT KINDA CLIPS IN AND THAT'S THE BIT THAT CHANGES
HMM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
THAT'S LIKE YOU KNOW A A CELLPHONE IT'S LIKE THE THE SCREEN IS ALWAYS JUST LEFT OPENED
AND SO WHAT WE ARE GONNA DO IT LIKE BRIGHT YELLOW WITH THE R. R.
YELLOW
YEAH
OH THAT ONE
UM
HA HANG ON LET ME CATCH UP
DID WE FINALISE WHAT BUTTONS WE'RE INCLUDING OR WE JUST EVERYTHING THAT WE SAID BEFORE
YEAH
FUN
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY SO TREND WATCHING
UH SINCE WE DO PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS IT IS KIND OF IMPORTANT HOW OUR PRODUCT LOOKS
SO I GUESS WE CAN GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE NEXT
SO WHAT THEY WANT
RIGHT NOW CUSTOMERS WANT FANCY VERSUS FUNCTIONAL
UM BASICALLY ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT OF WHAT THEY LIKE OF THE PRODUCT THAT THEY WANT DESCRIBING LIKE THE IN ORDER OF HOW MUCH THEY WANT
FIFTY EIGHT PER CENT OF THE DECISION OF WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE FANCY VERSUS FUNCTIONAL
AND THEN IT HAS TO ALSO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND YET EASY TO USE
SO THE CUSTOMER BASICALLY IS CONFUSED
THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT
THEY WANT US TO TELL THEM
YES
EXACTLY
SO WE CAN GO TO NEXT
OKAY
SO IN MILAN AND PARIS RECENTLY THE TRENDS HAVE BEEN SHOWING THAT CLOTHING SHOES AND FURNITURE ARE BASICALLY JUST COVERED WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLE PATTERNS
SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO GO WITH THAT UM AND ALSO THE SPONGY FEEL IS IN IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR
I DON'T KNOW REALLY
I MEAN I GUESS THE SPONGY COULD RELATE TO THE BUTTONS IF WE WANT TO RATHER THAN LIKE A HARD CLICKY BUTTON THAT YOU FIND ON LIKE SOME MOBILES AND STUFF
YOU'D WANT LIKE A SOFTER TOUCH
I MEAN DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YEAH
UM
BUT AS FOR THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLE PATTERNS I DON'T KNOW IF WE REALLY WANT TO GO WITH THAT BECAUSE IT IS JUST A TREND
AND OUR PRODUCT WE WANT TO STAY AROUND FOR MUCH LONGER THAN JUST A FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YEAH
I MEAN THAT COULD JUST BE A SPRING THING RIGHT NOW
OKAY
AWESOME
UM SO DESIGN PREFERENCES UM WE NEED EASY TO READ LIKE LARGE BUTTONS CLEARLY LABELLED SO THAT I MEAN 'CAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEING A PROBLEM
UM AND THEN ALSO BUTTONS ILLUMINATING UPON TOUCH YOU SAID THAT IN YOUR DESIGN WITH THE BULB
UM AND THAT COULD ALSO TIE IN WITH THE COLOUR SCHEME
UH WE NEED THE REAL REACTION LOGO AND COLOUR SCHEME OBVIOUSLY
THAT'S ONE OF OUR KEY GOALS WE WANNA PROMOTE OUR PRODUCT
AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF DESIGNS AND I CAME UP WITH SOMETHING
ACTUALLY RIGHT HERE
SO WHAT WE COULD DO IS SOMETHING LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED TELEPHONE LIKE THIS
WHERE WE PUT THE BUTTONS AROUND LIKE WE'D PUT A BIG ON OFF BUTTON OR SOMETHING ELSE IN THE MIDDLE
I MEAN IT COULD BE THE ARROWS OR WHATEVER FOR CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND THEN PUT THE NUMBERS AROUND IN LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED DIAL SHAPE
'CAUSE THEN IT'LL APPEAL TO OLDER GENERATION AND LIKE SAID RETRO'S COOL
SO IT'S CLASSICALLY RETRO
SO I MEAN THAT'S JUST AN IDEA IF YOU GUYS LIKE IT
AND YEP
AND THAT'S IT
THAT'S CUTE
YEAH
I HAVE FOUR OF THOSE REMOTES
OKAY
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING THOUGH YEAH
NO SPLINTERS WOULD
WHAT IS THAT
MM
RIGHT
OKAY
OH THIS THE THING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER
YEAH LIKE USING THE MENU TO BE LIKE ENTER YOUR NAME INTO THE SCREEN LIKE ON THE MENU OPTIONS
SO THAT WAY THE REMOTE READS IT
I FEEL LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD BE
I DON'T KNOW W IT WOULD BE TOO HARD TO REALLY I MEAN WE COULD DO IT BUT
TECHNOLOGY
AND IT IS A GROWING TREND THE HIGHER TECHNOLOGICAL LIKE
THE I MEAN JUST LIKE THE MORE ADVANCED IT IS
THE BETTER IT'LL SELL
YEAH 'CAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW HOW BIG IT'S GONNA BE AND HOW HEAVY
OH THE BASE YEAH
W
WE NEED TO DECIDE WELL SO WE CAN FIGURE HOW BIG IT'S GONNA BE LIKE EXACTLY WHAT BUTTONS WE WANT AND EXACTLY
IT COULD BE LIKE THIS
YES
I'D WELL UH
THIS ONE IS REALLY COMFORTABLE LIKE I LIKE THE SIDES WHATEVER BECAUSE
BUT IF WE HAVE THE UM THE LOCATOR THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
SO WE CAN MAKE IT SMALL IF WE HAVE A L LOCATING DEVICE
HMM
TWO DOUBLE A. S
FOR THIS SIZE
RIGHT
YEAH
SMALLER WITHOUT YEAH
I THINK IF WE HAD A A LOCATING DEVICE WITH THE SMALL ONE I THINK THAT SEEMS WAY MORE ADVANCED
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE I MEAN IF EVEN LOOKING AT CELLPHONES RIGHT NOW THOSE TRENDS THE SMALLER THE HOTTER IT IS YEAH
OH
YEAH
OUCH
A PHONE WHOA THAT WOULD WOW THAT WOULD HURT
YEAH WOOD
YEAH 'CAUSE IF IT'S GONNA COST US MORE TO PRODUCE A CHIP TITANIUM WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE
YEAH
WE COULD DO THAT BECAUSE ALL OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE ARE DEFINITELY WILLING TO SPEND MORE IF
GOOD PLAN
OH
YEAH WHO KNOWS
O OR WE COULD LIKE TAKE OFF THIS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE THE SOFT LATEX DEFINITELY IS SQUISHY
THAT'S IN
WELL I MEAN SQUISHIER THAN LIKE YEAH JUST A HARD PLASTIC
'CAUSE THAT UH WHAT IT TYPE OF YEAH FOR VOICE ACTIVATION WOULD IT BE LIKE A CERTAIN TERM WHAT WE WOULD SAY LIKE
BECAUSE PEOPLE COULD JUST BE TALKING AND WE DON'T WANT IT GOING OFF ALL THE TIME
SO UH
OOH
UH SEE I'M UH I'M STRANGELY ATTRACTED TO IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE BIG
BECAUSE IT'S I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST SO HIGH TECH
OH THEN MAYBE VOICE
MAYBE VOICE ACTIVATION WON'T BE GOOD
YEAH N N NO WE JUST WANT IT TO BE A FINDER
BUT DO CAN YOUR CAN THE DEPARTMENT MAKE
OH BRILLIANT THEN
YEAH GOOD POINT
I THINK TRIPLE A. IT'LL BE LIGHTER
I MEAN MORE MORE COME IN A PACKAGE
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD POINT
WE COULD THINK ABOUT IT AND COME BACK TO IT NEXT MEETING
WE STILL HAVE ONE MORE MEETING
YEAH IT COULD BE WHATEVER AS LONG AS THERE'S SOMETHING BIG IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE LIKE THE OLD PHONES
THERE'S LIKE THAT JUST LIKE PIECE OF METAL OR LIKE A PICTURE OR SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE
OH THAT'S TRUE
GOOD POINT
SO SCROLL BUTTONS ON THE SIDE AND THEN BUTTONS ON TOP
BUT WE DEFINITELY IF WE HAVE SCROLL THINGS ON THE SIDE WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO HAVE 'EM LABELLED
YEAH LIKE ON THE SIDE OF IT
OH IF IT'S JUST UP AND DOWN
WELL YOU COULD DO SOME ON BOTH SIDES
YEAH
THAT'S SQUISHY
THAT'S SQUISHY
HAVE BUTTONS
YEAH THAT
YEAH
YEAH OR LIKE A GUN METAL GREY 'CAUSE THEN IT COMBINES THE SILVER AND THE BLACK
YEAH BUTTONS WEAR OFF
HMM
BUT WE WANT IT TO BE SEEN
WE NEED IT TO BE SEEN
RIGHT
YEAH
SOME OF THO
WELL SOME OF THOSE BUTTONS THOUGH ARE BLUE BASED
UM WELL A LOT OF THOSE BUTTONS ARE BLUE BASED
WELL KIND OF
UM AND THEN IF V WE DO HAVE THEM ILLUMINATE UPON CONTACT THEY COULD ILLUMINATE YELLOW
LIKE IF WE LIKE THE ONE ALL THE WAY ON THE LEFT UH YOU CA YOU CAN SEE IT ON YOUR COMPUTER BETTER
UM WHERE THE BUTTON IS ACTUALLY BLUE BUT THE NUMBER ITSELF IS CLEAR OR WHITE OR WHATEVER SO IF YOU PRESSED IT WOULD ILLUMINATE YELLOW
SO WE'D HAVE BLUE AND YELLOW FOR THE TOUCH BUTTONS
YEAH
MM YEAH
ME TOO
OKAY
UM HERE'S THE AGENDA FOR OUR LAST MEETING
UM AFTER THE OPENING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION THEN WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THE EVALUATION CRITERIA AND THE FINANCING OF OUR REMOTE
THEN WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AND I THINK THE WHOLE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA CLOSE IT UP AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES SO
LET'S GET STARTED
OH NO LET'S HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
RIGHT
HMM
YEAH
GREAT
OKAY
OKAY
AND DID YOU DETERMINE UM THE CURVATURE OF THE BOTTOM PART OF IT FOR THE HAND IS IT GONNA BE A SINGLE OR A DOUBLE
SINGLE
SINGLE SOUNDS GOOD 'CAUSE IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH TO REALLY CONSTITUTE A DOUBLE
GREAT
GREAT
I THINK YOU DID AN AWESOME JOB
IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S EVERYTHING THAT WE DISCUSSED
GOOD JOB
ALRIGHT WHAT'S NEXT IN OUR AGENDA
UM WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THE EVALUATION CRITERIA AND THAT'S WITH COURTNEY
RIGHT
MM
RIGHT
SQI
RIGHT
RIGHT
'KAY
I'LL WAIT
ARE WE GOING TO INDI I SAY WE INDIVIDUALLY RATE WHAT DO YOU SAY
JUST ORALLY
WHY NOT
WE HAVE OKAY
UM EASY TO USE
I VOTE SIX
OH TWO
UH HELLO WE'RE GREAT
UM ONE
NO
ME TOO VERY CHIC
ONE I GIVE IT A ONE
OH AND MA IT'S A PROTOTYPE RIGHT
WELL NOW I'M
SO THE AVERAGE IS ABOUT A TWO
TWO OR THREE
TWO POINT FIVE
IMAGINE SINCE WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THAT
AND IT'S I IT IS VERY ERGONOMICALLY DESIGNED
IT'S GONNA BE CURVED
YEAH
I THINK SO TOO
'KAY
TWO
ALRIGHT AVERAGE IS TWO
IS IT TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
OH SORRY I'M TAKING OVER YOUR JOB HERE
GO RIGHT AHEAD
YES
RIGHT
WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT WITH THAT KIND OF CHIP
YEAH RIGHT
THAT WAS 'KAY
AND WE DISCUSSED THAT BEING INCLUDED
WELL WE DON' HAVE THE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T SAY CHANNEL AND IT CHANGES THE CHANNEL CHANNEL EIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
YEAH
I'D GO FOR A THREE OR FOUR ON THAT ONE SO OKAY LET'S GO FOR A THREE POINT FIVE
ALRIGHT AND THE LAST CRITERIA IS IT IS IT UM
WELL WE'VE COVERED THAT WITH THE TRENDY
SURE
CAPABLE
VERY CAPABLE
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
'KAY THERE WE GO
SO
NEXT
IT DOES
VERY GOOD
ALRIGHT LET'S GO BACK TO THIS
NO THAT'S IT
HMM
OOPS
OKAY SO NOW UH WE'RE MOVING ON TO FINANCE OKAY
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET AND WE'RE GOING TO FILL IT IN TOGETHER BASED ON WHAT COMPONENTS WE'RE INCLUDING IN OUR REMOTE AND SEE IF IT'S UNDER TWELVE FIFTY EURO
IF SO WE CAN PROCEED IF NOT WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD A LITTLE BIT
'KAY
SO LET ME BRING THAT UP
HERE WE GO
ALRIGHT
UM IT'S NOT HAND DYNAMO IT'S POWERED BY BATTERY SO WE GIVE IT A
NUMBER OF COMPONENTS YOU PLAN TO USE
DO I JUST PUT QUANTITY BEING ONE BATTERY OR
YEAH
BUT IF IT'S A DO YOU WANNA GO FOR THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE A FINAL CALL ON IF IT'S A LITHIUM OR DO WE WANNA GO TRIPLE A. S
'CAUSE TRIPLE A. S WE'RE GONNA HAVE T DO MORE THAN ONE BATTERY
OH LET'S JUST GO FOR A LITHIUM
WHAT DO YOU SAY
I THINK UH I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO PURCHASE THIS ARE GONNA BE TECHNOLOGICALLY RIGHT
OKAY DOWN TO THE ELECTRONICS UM SECTION
WE'RE GONNA NEED THIS KIND CORRECT IF WE DO THE VOICE SENSOR SO ONE OF THOSE
IT IS A SINGLE CURVED SO ONE OF THOSE
OH
WHAT'S THAT
YEAH THAT'S CORRECT
'KAY DOWN HERE CASE MATERIAL
PLASTIC
'KAY
DOWN HERE INTERFACE TYPE
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE INTEGRATED SCROLL SCROLL WHEEL
ISN'T OH THOSE ARE JUST REGULAR BUTTONS
THIS
OKAY SO WE CAN JUST GO UM
RIGHT I THINK SHE'S I THINK WHAT COURTNEY'S TALKING ABOUT IS DO WE NEED TO PUT TWO HERE
RIGHT
I DON'T KNOW THEY MIGHT PUT US WELL LET'S JUST
TWO OR WOULD IT BE THREE
OKAY AND WE'RE GONNA BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS THE BUTTONS ARE NO UH OKAY
ARE THEY
OH RIGHT
MM
WELL WE'RE UNDER COST THEN
ALRIGHT
NO WE'RE UNDER
TWELVE POINT FIVE IS OUR LIMIT
WE'VE GOT ELEVEN POINT TWO
ALRIGHT
WE CAN GO TO
I DUNNO WHAT I JUST DID
OKAY
NOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT PROCESS UM AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE SATISFIED WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS AND THE RESULT
UM DID WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
DID WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP UM TEAMWORK AND THE MEANS
MEANING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USED TO PRODUCE OUR LITTLE GUY THERE AND IF WE FOUND ANY NEW IDEAS
NOW QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DO THIS
DISCUSS SURE
ALRIGHT
WHO WANT WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST
HMM
HMM
AND HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WHOLE THE WHOLE PROCESS THOUGH
RIGHT AND WE GOT SAY OVER
WHAT HOW TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED IT SHOULD BE AND ALSO HOW FASHIONABLE WHICH I KIND OF LIKE WE YEP
YOU KNOW IT
UM WHAT ABOUT UM THE TEAMWORK ASPECT
HOW DID YOU GUYS ENJOY MAKING THE MODEL THE PROTOTYPE
I THINK YA' DID
DID YOU WORK WELL TOGETHER IN THERE AND 'KAY
OH MY GOD AND WE'VE ALL BEEN A PRETTY CONGENIAL TEAM HERE I THINK
WE HADN'T HAD ANY MA FALLINGS OUT
IRRITATING
OKAY
YEAH
I HAVE TO KNOCK THAT ONE DOWN A COUPLE NOTCHES
YEAH DIGITAL PENS
THEY WERE FINE
RIGHT LAPTOPS ARE EXTREMELY HANDY WIRELESS
AND THAT WE HAVE A SHARED NETWORK WHERE WE CAN PUT ALL OF THE
BIG BROTHER
'KAY HAVE WE FOUND ANY NEW IDEAS THROUGH THIS PROCESS
FOR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS COOL AND ALSO HAS WHAT I WANT IT TO B DO TECHNOLOGICALLY
AND THAT'S YOUR RIGHT BRAIN TAKING OVER W WANTING THE ARTISTIC THE FASHIONABLE THE HIP YOU KNOW
IF WE ALL JUST WENT OUT AND BOUGHT USEFUL THINGS I DON'T THINK I MEAN THAT'S NOT WHAT TECHNOLOGY
MM
YEAH
YEAH
JUST THE MAC FONT BOTHERS ME EVEN
BUT I DO LIKE IPODS GO FIGURE
YEAH
MM-HMM
COLOURS
EXACTLY
I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE WENT OUT AND BOUGH A NOKIA PHONE BACK WHEN WE WERE LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL
JUST SO THEY COULD GET THE CHANGEABLE FACE PLATES
OKAY
ANYWAY SO THAT IS DEFINITELY AT WORK
YEAH
FASHIONABLE CHIC PEOPLE WILL
HMM
THERE YOU GO MARKETING
ALRIGHT
OKAY WE'RE GONNA WRAP THIS UP NOW
UM THE COSTS ARE WITHIN THE BUDGET WE EVALUATED THE PROJECT AND NOW WE'RE GONNA COMPLETE THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG GIANT PARTY APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THIS SO
ALRIGHT THANK YOU TEAM YOU DID A GREAT JOB IT WAS LOVELY WORKING WITH YOU
MM 'KAY YOU READY
Y YOU READ THAT STUFF SINCE YOU WROTE IT
I'LL BE THE VANNA
NO
THEY'RE JUST BUTTONS
ON OFF SWITCH WILL BE HERE AND AS YOU'VE NOTICED ON OUR PROTOTYPE UM THEY'VE ENDED UP WITH A CURVATURE KIND OF
BY CONCAVE SORT OF THING EXCEPT FOR YOU KNOW CAN'T SEE UNDERNEATH
SO I'M HOPING THAT WHEN WE GET TO PRODUCTION WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THEM LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY
NICE TO STOCK YOU KNOW STICK YOUR FINGER IN
UM THE TWO SQUARED BUTTONS ARE ARE TWO PROBABLY LEAST USED MENU
MUTE AND THEN THESE ARE THE NUMBERS SO OUR CHANNEL AND OUR VOLUME WILL BE ON EITHER SIDE
I'D SAY A SINGLE
YEAH IT'S ONLY ACTUALLY THE SIZE OF MY HAND
WHOOHOO
YEAH IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO INCORPORATE THE COVER WITH THE CHERRY FRUIT ON IT
YES
I'D SAY TWO AS WELL
AT THE MOMENT NO
OKAY
I'LL GIVE IT A TWO BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT LOOKING THAT WAY
NEITHER ARE ALL O ALL THE CUSTOMERS WE HAVE EITHER
UH THE SHAPE OF IT ACTUALLY DOES UH
I'D SAY A TWO
WE COULD DO IT WITH THE CHIP YES
IT WASN'T WE HAVE NO REFLECTION OF IT ON THE PROTOTYPE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S ONLY TWO DIMENSIONS REALLY
IT
YEAH
THREE AND AN HALF
IT'S CAPABLE OF BEING SQUISHY AND FRUITY
HOW DID YOU GET THAT IN THERE
THE SLIGHTLY RESEMBLING A GIANT DELICIOUS COOKIE
THAT WAS GOOD
YEP
MM 'KAY
YEAH IT'S
YEP
WELL THAT'S THE PUSH BUTTON TOO RIGHT THERE
INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL OR PUSH BUTTON
WE'RE REALLY HAVING JUST PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE
BUT IT THAT JUST COVERS THE TYPE OF BUTTON WE'RE HAVING
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING A SCROLL ON THE SIDE IT'S STILL PUSH BUTTON
PUSH BUTTON
BUT WE JUST HAVE PUSH
YEAH
OKAY
LET'S CALL IT TH
OKAY
GRAND
SO WE CAN GO TO PRODUCTION
GO BACK
PREVIOUS
WE THINK WE GOT STIFLED FOR CRI CREATIVITY BY THE COMPANY ITSELF IN RESTRICTING US ONLY TO USING A T. V. REMOTE INITIALLY
RIGHT
YEAH
WELL NO THERE WAS THERE WAS SCRATCHING AND FIGHTING BUT NO
IRRITATING
THE MEANS THE WHITEBOARD DIDN'T WORK
A AND OUR FRIEND HERE REALLY FEELS STRONGLY ABOUT THE INTERNET
I REALLY APPRECIATED THOSE YEAH
THE USE OF THE LAPTOPS FOR RECEIVING EVERYTHING
IT WAS WIRELESS TOO SO
AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE SEXY DUAL MICROPHONES EVERYONE GETS TO WEAR
THE TORONTO DISTRICT SCHOOL WOULD ONLY USE HIS MACS WITH THEIR KIDS
WELL I IPODS ARE NOW QUITE TRENDY AND THEY COME IN DIFFERENT COLOURS
YEAH
NOT ME
I DIDN'T HAVE A PHONE 'TIL UNIVERSITY
THAT'S OKAY
WE CAN CREATE A COMMERCIAL WHERE THEY THINK THAT ALL THEIR NEEDS WILL BE MET
THIS WILL HELP THEM FIND THE ONE
THAT'S RIGHT
AND SO THE SERPENT SAYS USE OUR REMOTE
WHOOHOO
MARGARITAS FOR EVERYONE
YAY
THANKS TO THE PROJECT LEADER
NOW WE KNOW W
UM SURE
YOU OR ME
OKAY
WELL SINCE OUR MATERIALS AREN'T EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE GOING FOR I'M JUST GONNA TRANSLATE WHAT THIS ALL MEANS FOR YOU
THE BASE IS GONNA BE GUNMETAL GRAY WHICH IS WHAT WE HAD DECIDED AND IT'S GONNA BE PLASTIC
UM THEN THERE'S THE LATEX COVER WHICH IS WHAT YOU SEE AS RED
UM BECAUSE IT CAN BE REPLACEABLE WE JUST KINDA WENT WITH THE COLOUR
UM AND THEN THE BUTTONS ARE ACTUALLY KIND OF POKING THROUGH RATHER THAN ON TOP
UM AND THE BUTTONS WILL BE A L MUCH LIGHTER BLUE ALMOST SEE THROUGH
IT'S JUST SORT OF A VERY PALE BLUE AND A LIGHT UP YELLOW
THE WHOLE THING LIGHTS UP IF YOU PRESS ANY BUTTON RATHER THAN IT JUST THAT ONE BUTTON WILL LIGHT UP
UM AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM WE HAVE OUR LOGO
UM BRIGHT YELLOW SORT OF DESIGN WITH THE R. R. WHICH WILL ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE OUR LOGO
AND THEN ON THE SIDE YOU HAVE THE BUTTONS
THEY'RE ONE BUTTON BUT THEY KIND OF PUSH UP AND DOWN
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SCROLLING
RIGHT YEAH
AND THEN YEAH THE BUTTONS
THUMB SHAPED
YEAH
AND THEN THE LAST THING IS JUST THAT IT'LL BE BLACK LABELLING ON TOP JUST WHICH WE DIDN'T DO
SINGLE
RIGHT
OH THANK YOU
FEEL GOOD MEANING WHAT
PHYSICALLY OKAY
YEAH
TRUE OR FALSE EASY TO USE
YEAH
YEAH TWO
MM I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT FASHIONABLE
I'D GIVE IT LIKE THREE OR FOUR
BUT THEN I'M NOT FASHIONABLE SO
DON'T USE MY OPINION
DOES IT FEEL GOOD
YEAH IT'S GONNA BE THICKER
DEPTH
I'LL GIVE IT A ONE
OH RIGHT THE
RIGHT
YEAH I GO FOUR
SQUISHY AND FRUITY
IT'S JUST TRENDY BASICALLY
OKAY
IT'S PLASTIC
AND SPECIAL COLOUR
NO WE DON'T HAVE THE SCROLL
BUTTONS
OH LIKE THE TWENTY NINE MEANS LIKE YOU HAVE BOTH SCROLLS AND
PUSH BUTTONS
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SCROLLS
TWO INTERFACES IS THAT WHAT W SHOULD WE S SAY
OKAY FINE
YEAH
AND THEN S YEAH
WE'RE OVER
OKAY
OH I SEE
WE DIDN'T HAVE A WHITEBOARD
YEAH
AND NO INTERNET
I THINK WE DID WELL
YEP
GOUGES
IRRITATING
AND NO INTERNET
MISSES
I DO
THERE'S SO MUCH AVAILABLE
LIKE IT'S INFORMATION
YEAH
YEAH
WELL THAT'S WHY I DON'T LIKE UH MACS OR APPLES JUST 'CAUSE I LOOK AT IT AND I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY A VERY GOOD COMPUTER
BUT I LOOK AT IT AND I'M TAKEN BACK TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 'CAUSE THEY LOOK THE SAME
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY DID WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THAT'S SO OLD FASHIONED TO ME
EXACTLY SO I ASSOCIATE THEM WITH LIKE REALLY LOW TECH REALLY CHEAP BAD
YEAH
BUT THE MY BUT MY ONE ISSUE IS JUST LIKE THE WHOLE IT'S FOR T. V. ONLY
I WAS LIKE WHO'S GONNA BUY A REMOTE JUST FOR THE T. V. UNLESS THEY'VE LOST THEIRS
YOU'RE KIDDING
NO NO
NO MARKETING HAS TO ACTUALLY CREATE THE DESIRE FOR IT
RI THEY'LL BE SEXY WITH IT
OH RIGHT
LET YOU LOOSE
YEAH NO
GOOD
I WANNA FIND OUR IF OUR REMOTE WORKS
OH
WHOOHOO
THAT'S NICE
GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
YEAH
GOOD JOB YOU GUYS
THOSE ARE REALLY GOOD
OKAY IT'S A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
I DON'T REALLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD UH TALK ABOUT
IT'S UNDER EVALUATION
ALRIGHT
UM SO THESE ARE THE CRITERIA WE'RE GONNA ASK IS IT EASY TO USE
IS IT FASHIONABLE UH YEAH I GUESS WE SHOULD WRITE THESE DOWN SO WE CAN REFERENCE THEM
LIKE DOES IT FEEL GOOD LIKE YEAH PHYSICALLY
THAT'S JUST FOR CURRENT TREND
IT DOESN'T REALLY COUNT YOU GUYS
YEAH
BUT IT'S SO WE DO HAVE REMOVABLE COVERS RIGHT
YEAH WELL THEN THAT'S COVERED
AND SO WE N K EVERYBODY HAVE THAT
YEAH SHE'S GOT IT
IT'S GOOD
YEAH
OKAY SO WE'RE USING THE CRITERIA UH FOR A SEVEN POINT SCALE AND SO WE NEED TO DISCUSS HOW WE FEEL

DO WE FEEL IT'S VERY EASY TO USE
YOU GUYS
OKAY
OH WAIT THAT'S FALSE
OKAY
TWO
THAT'S WHAT I SAY

OH NO IT'S FINE YOU'RE I MEAN YOU'RE PROJECT MANAGER
UM YEAH I MEAN AND IT DOES IT HAVE VOICE I MEAN THE PHRASE RECOGNITION ON IT
AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN REPRESENT IT ON HERE
Y
YEAH SO
THEN YES THEN I WOULD WELL IT ISN'T WHAT ELSE WOULD IT NEED FOR IT TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
AND IT DOESN'T COVER ANYTHING OTHER THEN T. V. SO I'D PROBABLY GIVE IT A THREE
EVEN THOUGH IT IS FOR JUST A T. V. REMOTE IT'S UH VERY ADVANCED
BUT IT IS JUST A T. V. REMOTE
WELL YEAH SO I'D GIVE IT A TWO
OH IT'S VERY CAPABLE OF BEING SQUISHY AND FRUITY
YEAH
OKAY NEXT
SO UM OUR RE MODEL SLIGHTLY RESEMBLING A GIANT DELICIOUS COOKIE APPEARS TO BE A WINNER AND UH HOPEFULLY WE'LL SELL MILLIONS
GOOD JOB TEAM
WHAT
IT IT DOES
THANKS
TWO
YEAH
YEAH LET'S LET'S DO A LITHIUM
WE'RE GON THAT'S GON

AND SPECIAL COLOUR
BUT IT'S
YEAH BUT I SO I
BUT WILL WE W ACTUALLY WE'LL NEED TWO WON'T WE
ONE FOR THE TOP AND THEN ONE FOR THE S ONE E FOR EACH SIDE
OKAY
LIKE BECAUSE THERE'S LIKE ONE INTERFACE RIGHT HERE AND THEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE ON THE SAME PLANE WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON
THERE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE ADDITIONAL SIGNALS ON THE SIDES
SO IS THAT GONNA BE AN EXTRA ONE ON EACH SIDE
OR THREE BECAUSE OF ONE ON EACH SIDE AND ONE ON TOP
I MEAN IT'S FINE 'CAUSE IT COMES OUT THE SAME AS TWENTY NINE
WELL LESS THAN TWENTY NINE EVEN
THEY'RE A SPECIAL COLOUR
UM THEY'RE UH THEY'RE A SPECIAL FORM 'CAUSE THEY'RE INDENTED
AND THEY'RE A SPECIAL MATERIAL

I THINK WE JUST DISCUSS IT
OH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
NO YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT
'CAUSE I'D FORGOTTEN THAT THAT WASN'T OUR DECISION YEAH
OH OVERALL I MEAN I THOUGHT WE DID A GOOD JOB LIKE
WE GOT TO CHOOSE BASICALLY WE HAD CONTROL OVER MINUS IT BEING JUST MERELY A T. V. REMOTE WE GOT TO CHOOSE WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WITH IT
AND WE'RE A FASHION FORWARD TECHNOLOGY COMPANY
MINUS THAT ONE FIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN MINUS YOU GUYS BEING WHA WHAT IS IT THE SURVEY ANNOYING OR WHAT IS IT
IRRITATING YEAH
WOW THAT'S A IT'S DEFINITELY A STRONG ONE
YEAH
YEAH AND NO INTERNET

WE COULD HAVE LIKE AN ADAM AND EVE TYPE COMMERCIAL AND THAT'S THE FIG LEAF
MM
THAT'LL SELL
YEAH
YEAH
YOU TOO
RIGHT W WELCOME TO THE THE FIRST MEETING OF UH REAL REACTION'S UH UM DEVELOPMENT MEETINGS FOR OUR OUR NEW TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
UH THIS FOLLOWS OUR VERY SUCCESSFUL ENTRY INTO THE THE CONSUMER MARKET OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO UM WHICH WE WANT TO TO BUILD ON
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE UH THE THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE UH THE LATEST UH UH FEELINGS IN IN CONSUMER DESIGN AND AND DEMAND AND UH WE WANT TO MAKE THIS THE THE VERY BEST PRODUCT TH THAT'S POSSIBLE FOR EVERYBODY
UH ONE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS UH AT A GOOD PRICE FOR THE CONSUMER AND AT A GOOD PRICE FOR THE COMPANY
UH AND TO THAT END WE NEED ALL TO WORK TOGETHER UH TO DO THAT
UM AND UH B IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER BECAUSE EV EVERYBODY IS UH JUST AS VITAL TO THIS PROJECT UM I'LL JUST GO ROUND TH THE TABLE ANDREW
MARKETING UM M KENDRA WITH THE UH UM DESIGNING THE THE THE USER INTERFACE UH UH AND KATE WITH THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
UM
WHAT'S UH THE THE TH TH PROJECT IS IS HERE TO DO IS IS TO TO GET THIS THIS PROJECT UP AND MOVING
EV EVERYBODY IS IS FREE TO UH SAY WH WHATEVER THEY WANT UH EVERYBODY HAS A CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE AND UH
EVERYBODY FEEL FREE TO INTERRUPT ME AT ANY TIME TO TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
UM IN IN TERMS OF THE IMMEDIATE MEETING THE UH UM EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY ELSE
EVERYBODY'S WORKED FOR THE THE COMPANY FOR A WHILE IF IF AN ANYBODY FEELS THAT THEY NEED TO SAY MORE ABOUT THEMSELVES PLEASE DO
IF IF IF ANYBODY WANTS TO B BRIEFLY GIVE THEIR THEIR BACKGROUND SO THAT EVERYBODY'S QUITE CLEAR WHAT EVERYBODY UH UH EVERYBODY'S EXPERIENCE IS PLEASE DO SO
UH
IN FACT I'D I'D I'D WELCOME ANYBODY TO UH SAY SOMETHING BRIEFLY ABOUT THEMSELVES
IN FACT WE WILL DO THAT BY BY GOING ROUND THE TABLE QUICKLY AND AND SAYING WHAT WHAT CONTRIBUTION YOU YOU'RE LOOKING TO MAKE
SO WE'LL START WITH ANDREW
RIGHT KENDRA
RIGHT AT LEAST MEANS YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY PRECONCEIVED IDEAS SO
YEP GOOD
OKAY VERY VERY QUICKLY
UM THIS I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS MEETING TOO STRUCTURED BECAUSE THE THE WHOLE IDEA IS THAT IT'S A UM YOU KNOW A THINK TANK
EVERYBODY SAYS WHAT THEY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY
UH AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE CONSTRAINED BY UH KIND OF CONVENTION OR UH UH SLIDES ON SCREENS OR OR ANYTHING ELSE UM BUT UM BRIEFLY UM TH TH THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO
THE THE REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO BE ORIGINAL
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT UH OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS DON'T HAVE SO THAT AS SOON AS PEOPLE SEE IT THEY THINK UM YES THAT'S DIFFERENT
UH I WANT ONE UM AND THAT GOES ALONG WITH BEING TRENDY UH UH YOU KNOW THE I WANT IT
UH SCENARIO
USER FRIENDLY AS AS WE ALL KNOW
REMOTE CONTROLS CAN BE UH UH VERY USER UNFRIENDLY SO WE WANT TO MAKE OURS ONE THAT PEOPLE CAN PICK UP AND THINK OH YES THAT'S IT'S OBVIOUS HOW THAT WORKS
UH AND THEY ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE PRICE AND THINK OH YEAH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I MAY NOT NEED ANOTHER REMOTE CONTROL BUT UH IT'S SUCH A NICE ONE I'M GONNA HAVE ONE
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST OR INDEED FIRST OF ALL IT IT MUST MAKE THE COMPANY MONEY
AND WE MAKE THE COMPANY MONEY BY PRODUCING WHAT THE CONSUMER WANTS
THE UH THE FURTHER WORK TO BE DONE IS I THE UM THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH WHAT IT UH WHAT IT MUST ACTUALLY DO
THE UH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN UH HOW WE ACTUALLY PRESENT THAT TO THE CONSUMER AND TH THE THE DETAILED DESIGN I IS UH HOW WE GET THAT INTO PRODUCTION
UH NOW TH THE MAIN DESIGN TOOL THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US AT THE MOMENT IS IS THE WHITE BOARD AND UH UH LET US VERY QUICKLY DO WHAT I WHAT IT SAYS IN THE IN THE IN THE PROMPT SLIDE HERE
UM
IN FACT I SUGGEST TO AVOID EVERYBODY UNTANGLING THEMSELVES FROM THE UH THE THE WIRES THAT WE DON'T DO THAT UM
SO I I EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WHITEBOARD IS SO WE'LL UM UH WE'LL DO A VIRTUAL DRAWING ON THE ON ON THE WHITEBOARD OF OF YOUR YOUR OWN UH UH FAVOURITE ANIMAL
BUT LE LET'S GO ROUND THE TABLE YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL
MM AND WHY
UH-HUH
OH RIGHT UH MY MY WIFE SAYS MY BEARD LOOKS LIKE A BADGER'S ARSE 'CAUSE OF THE THE WHITE STREAKS IN IT
KENDRA
UH-HUH
RIGHT OKAY
UH-HUH FAIR ENOUGH YEAH
I'M NOT SURE THAT I'VE GOT ANY FAVOURITE ANIMAL TO BE QUITE HONEST I THINK HOMO SAPIEN BECAUSE OF THEIR THEIR UH OVERALL ABILITY TO UH UH
SORRY
INDEED ABSOLUTELY YES THA THAT'S UM
OKAY AND UH W WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND HERE THAT THE UH WE WANT TO SELL THIS FOR FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO UM
WE WANT TO M MAKE AN OVERALL PROFIT FOR THE THE COMPANY OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT SELLING A LOT OF THESE UM AG ACROSS THE THE ENTIRE PLANET AND AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A GROSS PROFIT OF FIFTY PERCENT
IT NEEDS TO COST TWELVE EUROS FIFTY TO MAKE
UM SO WE'RE NOT ONLY LOOKING AT A A VERY TRENDY ORIGINAL PRODUCT WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING IT AT A VERY GOOD PRICE
UM OKAY UM WOULD ANYBODY LIKE T LIKE TO TO START BY GIVING THEIR O UM SORT OF QUICK VIEWS OF OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
NO
ANY ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT BUTTONS OR ANY OTH OTHER WAY OF APPROACHING THE P THE UH THE PROBLEM
OR ANYBODY ELSE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS
ARE THERE YOU KNOW BAD ONES THEY'VE USED OR GOOD ONES THEY'VE USED OR ONES THAT THEY'VE LOST AND NEVER FOUND AGAIN
UM WHAT SO WH WHAT'S IN IN WHAT PARTICULAR STYLE FEATURES ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
UH-HUH
YEAH D NO I MEAN DO YOU THINK THERE'S A RISK IF IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE REMOTE CONTROL PEOPLE WON'T SEE IT AS A REMOTE CONTROL UM AND UH
UH-HUH
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS ABOUT UM TH THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF A OF REMOTE CONTROLS
I MEAN TH THE THING THAT I IMMEDIATELY COMES TO MIND IS COMPUTER MOUSES WHICH UM I MEAN Y YOU GET ALL SORTS OF SHAPES IN THE SHOPS AND S YOU KNOW SOME QUITE FANCY ONES UM THAN THE SOME FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHICH LOOK NICE BUT AREN'T PARTICULARLY COMFORTABLE
UM ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT BUTTONS OR FLAT SCREENS OR UH UH
YES I MEAN THE ONLY THING IS IF IF YOU'RE WATCHING TELEVISION IN A IN A A DARKENED ROOM UM YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO UH
FI FIND THE BUTTON BUTTONS EASILY
YEAH THAT'S UH MUST ADMIT I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN ONE WITH CONCAVE BUTTONS THAT'S UH CERTAINLY BE DIFFERENT
UM DO WE NEED IT TO UH I CAN'T THINK OF ANY RE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT I KNOW OF THAT ACTUALLY LIGHT UP AT ALL
DO WE DO WE WANT UH
YEAH
OKAY
SO
ANDREW HAVE YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS YET ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT MARKET SOMETHING WHICH THERE ARE ALREADY MILLIONS OUT THERE AND THAT WE WANT TO UH UH UH T TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE
UM THE PLANET WITH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY YEAH YEAH WELL I D I THINK AN ANY UH ANY FACETS THAT WE IDENTIFY W WE AIM NEED TO AIM FOR FOR ALL OF
UM OKAY WELL FIRST THOUGHTS ON UM
THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN SIDE
INDEED
YEAH
OKAY AND UM COLOURS MATERIALS
KENDRA ANYONE
YEAH
UH-HUH
RIGHT
YEAH
OKAY THAT'S UH
AGAIN I DON'T THINK THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
IT'S UH THE SORT OF THE SORT OF THING THAT WOULD GET PEOPLE UH THINKING YES THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN'T GOT AND UH
MIGHT NEED SO
UH ANDREW ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT UH HOW WE MIGHT MARKET INTERCHANGEABLE FRONTS ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK
MM MM
RIGHT OKAY I THINK WE'VE GOT UM A GOOD IDEA NOW
WE UH MEETING IS UH
NEEDS TO BE K UH WRAPPED UP FAIRLY QUICKLY
SO UH UM WE'VE GOT THIRTY MINUTES TO
START LOOKING AT THE UM AT THE DESIGN IN MORE DETAIL
UM
THEN WE'LL WE WILL RECONVENE IN IN THIRTY MINUTES AND TRY TO GET SOME OF THESE IDEAS UH
UH MORE FORMALISED
UH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
UH I'M KATIE I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND I'LL JUST BE I GUESS PRESENTING ABOUT THE THE INTER WORKINGS OF OUR LITTLE REMOTE CONTROL AND UH YEAH
UH 'S HORSES NO PARTICULAR REASON WHY
UM
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS IT'LL ACTUALLY PICK UP THE SIGNALS FROM KIND OF ANYWHERE AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIKE CONTORT YOURSELF AND TWIST YOUR REMOTE CONTROL TO GET IT THE T. V. TO ACTUALLY PICK UP THE SIGNAL
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM THAT WOULD BE GOOD
MM
MM
MM
OH I THINK IT'S IT'S REMOTE CONTROLS ARE KIND OF A UNIQUE OBJECT 'CAUSE IT'S YOU DEPEND ON THEM SO MUCH
BUT YOU DON'T I I IT'S YOU SORT OF JUST ASSUME THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA WORK
YOU DON'T THINK OF THEM AS A COMP LIKE A COMPUTER CAN BREAK DOWN AND YOU'RE KINDA LIKE OH WELL FAIR ENOUGH THERE'S ALL THESE COMPLEX THINGS GOING ON
IT'S GONNA SOMETHING'S GONNA GET MESSED UP EVENTUALLY
THEY THEY JUST NEED TO BE VERY VERY DEPENDABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE SORT OF TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED AND THEN IF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BREAKS IT'S
GOD FORBID YOU ACTUALLY GET UP AND MANUALLY CHANGE THE CHANNEL IT JUST IT NEEDS TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE VERY ALWAYS DEPENDABLE
UH I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT TOO SMALL I 'CAUSE I THINK IT NEEDS TO IT CAN'T BE TOO BIG LIKE YOU WERE SAYING BIG AN AND HUGE AND UM AWKWARD
BUT ALSO IF YOU MAKE IT TOO SMALL KINDA LIKE YOU KNOW HOW MOBILE PHONES ARE GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER UM
IT'S JUST GONNA END UP UNDER A COUCH CUSHION SOMEWHERE AND UM YEAH
BUT SO YES DEPENDABLE AND HAVE A GOOD MEDIUM RANGE SIZE
MM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
WELL YOU COULD COME UP WITH LIKE NOVELTY ONES LIKE THEY'VE DONE WITH THE THE MOBILE PHONES
YOU CAN GET LIKE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SCENES FROM DIFFERENT MOVIES AND STUFF ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND SORTA STAGGER THE RELEASE OF THEM AND GET PEOPLE LIKE OH I WANT THAT COVER ON IT NOW AND THAT'LL KEEP THEM SPENDING MONEY
THANK YOU
I'M KENDRA AND I'M THE US USER INTERFACE DESIGNER AND UM I HAVEN'T HAD A WHOLE LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE BUT I'M M SO I'LL BE
WORKING ON THE DESIGN
RIGHT
YEP I'M JUST OPEN TO BEING CREATIVE
UM PROBABLY A DUCK I JUST I LI I LIKE THE WAY THEY LOOK AND THEY'RE JUST NICE ANIMALS AND I LIKE HOW THEY CAN FLY OR SWIM OR WALK AROUND OR WHATEVER
WELL I THINK I FIND A LOT OF THEM REALLY COMPLICATED TO USE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT BUTTONS AND UH IT'S HANDIEST WHEN YOU HAVE ONE THAT WORKS BOTH THE D. V. D. PLAYER OR WHATEVER AND THE T. V. AS WELL
UM
BUT THAT IT'S EASY TO IF YOU CAN SWITCH BACK AND FORTH INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PRESS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS AND SO I THINK IT'S IS BEST WHEN THEY'RE CLEARLY LABELLED AND YOU CAN SEE WHICH BUTTONS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE
YOU KNOW
YEAH
I THINK SOMETHING THAT'S COMFORTABLE TO HOLD BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU GET THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE JUST THOSE BIG
RECTANGULAR THINGS AND UH THEY'RE KIND OF AWKWARD TO HOLD ONTO SO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE COMFORTABLE THAT FITS IN A PERSON'S HAND BETTER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT MAYBE THEY COULD BE CONCAVE INSTEAD OF STICKING UP TO HAVE THEM BE KIND OF DOWN SO YOU COULD FEEL THEM
BETTER
OH YEAH
LIKE A LIKE A MOBILE PHONE
YEAH
WELL MOST I THINK MOST OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS NOW ARE EITHER JUST BLACK OR GREY
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD GO WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT OR BE ABLE TO I WAS JUST THINKING OF UM WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH MOBILE PHONES NOW HOW YOU CAN GET THE DIFFERENT UM WHAT ARE THEY CALLED
LIKE THE FACE PLATES THAT YOU CHANGE SO WE COULD HAVE MAYBE I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT
WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE THE FACE PLATES OR HAVE KIND OF A VARIETY SO PEOPLE CAN GET DIFFERENT DIFFERENT THINGS
HAVE IT KIND OF LOOK HOW THEY WANT TO DIFFERENT COLOURS THINGS LIKE THAT PROBABLY JUST PLASTIC BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE LIGHTEST
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM
OH MY NAME'S ANDREW I'M A I'M THE MARKET RESEARCH
PERSON FOR THIS UH FOR THIS MEETING AND THIS UH PROJECT FOR CREATING THIS NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND UH YEAH I'LL BE UH PRESENTING INFORMATION STATISTICS ON WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO WANT TO UH GET FROM THIS NEW DESIGN
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIKE AND FROM A FASHION POINT OF VIEW AND THE PRACTICALITY POINT OF VIEW
UM BADGER
UH IT'S IT'S GOT NICE CONTRAST WITH BLACK AND WHITE AND UH I FEEL THEY'RE UNDERDOG KIND OF STATUS AND THEY'RE THE
MAKE MOBILE PHONES AND T. V. REMOTES TO MAKE T. V. REMOTES
YEAH
THINK A LOT OF THE TIME REMOTES THAT COME WITH T. V. PLAYERS AND T. V. S AND D. V. PLAYERS LIKE THEY AREN'T
LIKE AN AREA THAT'S PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THEY'RE VERY BORING VERY PLAIN
LIKE IT'S VERY A VERY LIKE UM MAKING A A STYLISH REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE A VERY LIKE
EASILY PUT US ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE CURRENT COMPETITION
UM
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LOOKS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE REMOTE CONTROL
SO IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE UH SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU THINK OH WHAT'S THIS
LIKE THIS PEN DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE A PEN BUT IT MAKES YOU THINK OH
SO SORRY THAT'S A BIT VAGUE
UH I SUPPOSE SUPPOSE THAT'S UP TO THE MARKETING TO
TO MAKE MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF THE PRODUCT
MM
YEAH
WELL FROM THE MOUSE IDEA YOU COULD REMOTE IS A PIECE OF PLASTIC WITH THE BIG RUBBER BUTTONS STICKING OUT OF IT WHICH YOU PRESS
WHEREAS IF YOU WANT COULD ALL BE FLAT AND THE BUTTONS ARE VERY KIND OF ALMOST SUBTLE THAT INSTEAD OF BEING RAISED OUT OF THE DEVICE UH YOU PUSH INTO DEVICE YOU SEE
LIKE A MOUSE BUTTON
I SUPPOSE
EASILY YEAH YEAH
MM
MM YEAH THAT WOULD BE GOOD
MM-HMM UM ESPECIALLY IF WE TRY TO SELL WHAT TWO MILLION OF THEM
OH SORRY FOUR MILLION OF 'EM BUT UH
I THINK IF W IF WE MARKET IT AS AS NOT AS NOT WELL THIS YOU C YOU COULD EITHER MARKET IT AS THE POINT OF VIEW WE COULD HAVE THE TWO WE COULD HAVE PARALLEL MARKETING S SCHEMES WHERE YOU'VE GOT ONE WHERE IT APPEALS TO PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HAVE THE NEW DEVICE THAT LOOKS COOL
IS FASHIONABLE AND LIKE YOU JUST IT'S IT'S LIKE UH IT'S ONE THAT RATHER THAN RA I WAN I WANT RATHER THAN A KIND OF A NEED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEVICE
BUT THAT MIGHT CONSIDERING THE ACT WHAT THE DEVICE IS FOR AND THE NATURE OF SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE RESPOND TO HAVING A DEVICE THAT THEY JUST LOOKS NICE
THEREFORE THEY WANT IT SO MAKE IT PRACTICAL AT THE SAME TIME
I THINK IT'S THIS IS GONNA HAVE TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE THAT WANT DEVICE THAT CAN ENHANCE THEIR LIVING ROOM UH BUT ALSO A DEVICE THAT UH
IS PRACTICALLY SOUND
SO UM I DUNNO WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH WHICH ANGLE WE'RE GONNA GO TO OR BOTH
IF YOU
MM
UM WELL WE COULD EITHER MARKET IT TOGETHER BY GETTING CONTROL IN A SET COLOUR OR WITH LIKE YOU BUY IT WITH SEVERAL
UH LIKE
YOU GE YOU GET THE F UH THE FACE PLATES WITH IT WHEN YOU BUY OR AS A SEPARATE THING
BUT UH MAYBE THINKING OF THAT IT'S CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF THE DEVICE
MAYBE A SECOND THING LIKE A SECOND CAMPAIGN TO MARKET NEW FACIALS FOR YOUR TO YOUR MIGHT GO A BIT ASTRAY SINCE IT IS THE KIND OF THING WHERE Y YOU GENERALLY GET ONE AND THEN FORGET ABOUT IT
UNLESS YOU WERE TRYING TO
MM
OH IT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM
YEAH TRUE
OKAY WELCOME TO THE SECOND MEETING OF THIS UH DESIGN GROUP
UM
I'LL BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THE UH
NOTES OF THE OF THE LAST MEETING
UH JUST DONE IN IN NOTE FORM AND I HAVEN'T ATTRIBUTED ANYTHING TO INDIVIDUALS
BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING STRICTLY AS A TEAM HERE AND UH N NOBODY'S WORKING EQUALLY SO UH
UM WE WE S WE SAW THAT THE THE PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS WERE THE UH B A BORING SHAPE AND BORING COLOUR
UM AND AND WE S WE SAW THAT THE UM WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO WAS TO TO MAKE SURE THE DEVICE UM CONTROLS SEVERAL ITEMS
THAT SWITCHING WAS EASY
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T NEED TO POINT THE THING AT UH ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR UM THAT IT NEED TO BE CONTOURED TO MAKE IT INTERESTING
THAT THE KEYS MIGHT BE CONCAVE SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE THAT WE KNOW OF
UM SHOULD HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE FASCIAS SO PEOPLE CAN PERSONALISE IT UM ILLUMINATED SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE IT IN DARK ROOMS
UM AND THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT IT AS AS IN ADDITION TO THEIR EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS
UM AND THAT IT SH IT SHOULD JUST ALWAYS WORK WHENEVER YOU UH UM
MM UH USE IT
AND THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO SMALL MM THAT IT IT GETS LOST
UM
NOW UH
UH I'LL SHORTLY ASK FOR FOR THREE THREE PRESENTATIONS
UH BEFORE I DO THAT HOWEVER
I WILL GO THROUGH SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS THAT UM THE THE MANAGEMENT HAVE PLACED ON US AND UH WILL BE CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE FIRST MEETING
UM THE UH
THE MA THE MANAGEMENT HAS HAD IT'S OWN THOUGHTS ON THIS AND UH THE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH WITH WHAT WE UH WE THOUGHT
UM AND AND THEN WE'LL AS A RESULT OF THAT WE WILL THEN TALK THROUGH THE THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE SEE THE THE DEVICE UM ACTUALLY B CARRYING OUT
AND WE HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES TO DO THIS IN AND I UH
ANYWAY
OKAY
NOW
THE N THE NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE UM THE THE MANAGEMENT TEAM SEE THAT UM TELETEXT IS NO LONGER OF ANY IMPORTANCE GIVEN THE UH THE RISE OF THE INTERNET
UM AND AND THEY WANT IT ONLY TO COVER TELEVISIONS
UM NOW
WHAT IS NOT Q QUITE CLEAR FROM THEIR DIRECTIVE IS WHETHER THEY MEAN TH THEY DON'T WANT IT TO COVER TELETEXT OR WHETHER THEY DON'T WANT IT TO COVER
YOU KNOW
VIDEOS D. V. D. S UM SATELLITE BOXES WHICH UH I MEAN WE SAW AS BEING FUNDAMENTAL TO THE UH TO THE EXERCISE
THE UM THE ACTUAL WORDING OF THE DIRECTIVE IS THAT IT SHOULD COVER TELEVISION ONLY
UM AND ON THAT BASIS UM I I THINK WE WE NEED TO BEAR THAT IN MIND
UM BUT POSSIBLY UH KEEP AT THE BACKS OF OUR MINDS THAT THE REALITY THAT PEOPLE EVEN WHEN THEY UH NO LONGER THEY DON'T LOOK AT TELETEXT ANYMORE
THEY CERTAINLY DO LOOK AT OTHER THINGS
UM THE DEVICE HAS TO INCORPORATE THE COMPANY LOGO AND COLOURS
UM THE THE LOGO UH BEING AT B THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN THERE THE THE THE TWO R. S IN GREY AGAINST UH A YELLOW BACKGROUND
UM NOW THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME OF OUR IDEAS ABOUT MAKING IT ATTRACTIVE TO THE T TO THE MARKET
BUT UH DO DO INTRODUCE SOME SOME CONSTRAINTS AS TO HOW WE MIGHT DO THAT
UM IT ALSO HAS TO BE SIMPLE WHICH TO SOME EXTENT GOES ALONG W WITH THE FIRST ONE
AND THAT WE'VE ALREADY SAID THAT IT MUST BE SIMPLE 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT ANYWAY
UM BUT THEY ALSO WANT IT TO BE SIMPLE TO GET IT TO THE MARKET QUICKLY WHICH UM
MM UH IS IS IS THEIR CHOICE BUT UH UM WE WE NEED TO TALK THAT THROUGH
UM OKAY SO UH
AFTER THE MEETING IT'LL BE SUMMARISED AND UH
UM NOTES SENT OUT AND UH ETCETERA
OKAY SO WE'LL FIRST OF ALL MM HAVE INDIVIDUAL REPORTS FROM EVERYBODY
UM AGAIN I THERE IS NO ORDER OF PRECEDENCE HERE UM SO I I I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU TO WHO WHO WHO THINKS THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO GO FIRST
P FINE
OH SORRY YOU CAN INDEED
OH IF YOU CLICK ON THE UM UH THE ONE THAT THAT LOOKS LIKE A PROJECTION SCREEN NO THE ONE TO THE RIGHT OF THAT
THAT ONE
MM
MM
GOSH MUST BE SOME TELLY ADDICTS OUT THERE IF THEY GET R. S. I. FROM THEIR TELEVISION REMOTE IS ALL I CAN SAY
MM
RIGHT
MM
YEAH I MUST SAY THAT UM THE UH I C CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT UM F YOU KNOW PHONE SERVICE I WAS USING THE OTHER DAY
BUT THAT HAD SORTA SPEECH RECOGNITION WHICH WORKED UH REMARKABLY WELL SO THAT IS INDEED A UH
UM
A THOUGHT AND IT IT CUTS OUT UH
I WAS WAS GONNA SAY YOU CAN'T GET A LOT OF R. S. I. J JUST GET JAW ACHE
OKAY SORRY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I MEAN
YEAH
MM
HMM-HMM
UH
SHOULD WE ACTUALLY BITE THE BULLET HERE
IF PEOPLE REALLY DON'T USE THOSE BUTTONS TO ANY EXTENT AT ALL UM REMOVE THEM ALTOGETHER
WE WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH UM
I WONDER WHETHER WE COULD GET THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH NO BUTTONS AT ALL IF WE WENT FOR VOICE RECOGNITION GIVEN THAT UM THE
UM NOW THE THE AGE STRUCTURE WE WERE LOOKING AT UM I MEAN W WE HAD USAGE BY AGE STRUCTURE
WHAT WE DIDN'T HAVE WAS WHAT PROPORTION OF PEOPLE USING REMOTES WERE IN THOSE PARTICULAR AGE GROUPS
NOW DO WE KNOW WHETHER THEY
FORTY NO SORRY FOR FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE AGE GROUP UH TO PUT MYSELF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
UM U USE REMOTE CONTROLS TO A GREAT EXTENT
YES WE
THAT WOULD 'VE SPEECH RECOGN RIGHT
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT UM WELL AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW THE RELATIVE PROPORTION THE RELATIVE NUMBERS IN THE AGE GROUPS
IF WE WANTED SOMETHING
DIFFERENT TRULY DIFFERENT THEN THE BUTTONLESS REMOTE CONTROL W WOULD BE IT
BUT IF YOU JUST LIFT IT UP AND SAY CHANNEL ONE OR B. B. C.
IT C WELL IT I CAN I CAN SEE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS WITH THAT IN TERMS OF THE YOU KNOW
THE SOUND FROM THE TELEVISION BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY ACTUALLY ON THE TELEVISION SAYS UH UH YOU KNOW
I. T. V. AND YOU'RE WATCHING B. B. C. THEN THEN IT MIGHT UM CHANGE ITSELF SO IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE UM POSSIBLY ACTUALLY NEED A BUTTON ON IT
JUST TO ACTIVATE IT
OR OR SOMETHING JUST TO IDENTIFY THAT YOU'VE LIFTED IT UP AND IT'S USE
AND AND THEN JUST SAY OH I DON'T KNOW A THOUGHT AND AND THEN UH I MEAN THAT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE UH TRULY DIFFERENT
UM 'CAUSE UH YOU KNOW AUDIO SETTINGS NOUGHT POINT EIGHT PERCENT
I MEAN IF THEY WEREN'T THERE
WOULD PEOPLE MISS THEM
VOL VOLUME YES UM TH W WE NEED TO S IDENTIFY THINGS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY NEED AND AND IT'S A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY AND RELEVANCE
AND UM I WOULD SAY IGNORING IG IGNORING POWER FOR THE MOMENT
UM THE CHANNEL AND VOLUME AND TH W W GIVEN GIVEN THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO IGNORE TELETEXT
UH CHANNEL AND VOLUME ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT
UH WOULD APPEAR TO BE ESSENTIAL
UM
SO WE IF WE CAN DESIGN SOMETHING THAT THAT LOOKS INTERESTING
KNOW OR LOOKS DIFFERENT
UM INCORPORATES THE THE LOGO AND AND THE COLOURS AND UM WE CAN STILL HAVE OUR INTERCHANGEABLE FASCIAS EVEN IF IT'S THE YELLOW AND GREY UM
AND UH I DUNNO BUTTONS OR OR BUTTONS AS AN OPTION
DO PLEASE
MM-HMM
YOU CER CERTAINLY COULD
DEPE UH I DEPENDS WHETHER UM IF WE WANT TO MAKE THIS
SO SIMPLE THAT ANYBODY CAN WALK INTO THE ROOM AND LIFT IT UP AND SAY
B. B. C. ONE
UM OKAY I MEAN YOU COULD
PRINT ACTUALLY PRINT IT ON THE UH
DEVICE ITSELF
UM
S TH THIS I TH THAT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A PROBLEM I THINK
UM AND I I I S SO I SUPPOSE ONE UM
COULD MAKE IT SO DESIRABLE THAT IF PEOPLE LOSE IT THEY IMMEDIATELY GO OUT AND BUY ANOTHER ONE
ANYWAY SORRY CARRY ON
DO YOU WANT TO JUST CARRY ON WITH
OR NO NO NO UH B I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR REPORT THERE
MM OKAY
MM-HMM
S S WE COULD WE COULD MAKE IT DUAL FUNCTION VOICE RECOGNITION AND STILL HAVE BUTTONS ON IT UM 'CAUSE WE'RE
CERTAINLY COULD
YEAH YEAH
THE I MEAN THE THE ADVANTAGE OF DOING AWAY THE BUTTONS ALTOGETHER IS IT MAKES THE THING CHEAPER
NO IT COU CERTAINLY OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY FOR MAKING IT UH YOU KNOW VISUALLY VERY DISTINCTIVE
UM 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A OBLONG BOX
MM YEAH
OKAY WHO SORRY HAVE YOU HAVE YOU FINISHED THERE ANDY
YEP YEP
UM GIVEN THAT WE'VE ALREADY HAD A EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION UH
AH THERE WE GO
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
OKAY CAN I UM I'M ACTUALLY GONNA USE THE UM IT'S GONNA CAUSE GREAT TECHNICAL PROBLEMS OVER HERE
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA USE THE
YES RATHER THAN THE UH THE THE TRADITIONAL IN FACT UM I WON'T EVEN GO THAT FAR
UM SOMETHING LIKE THIS SHAPE YOU KNOW
SORT OF SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN THAT'S SORT OF A MORE VERTICAL SHAPE
UM THAT YOU YOU SORT OF HOLD IN YOUR HAND UM WELL I'M TRYING TO THINK
UH UH UH L UH L SUCH AS I MEAN UM SOMETHING YOU HOLD UP LIKE THAT POSSIBLY WITH A COUPLE OF BUTTONS LIKE THAT
BUT WITH THE THE ENTIRE TOP WITH THE YOU KNOW THE UH THE INFRARED OR WHATEVER SOURCE
UH SO THAT YOU KNOW IT'S
FLYING OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS SO THAT UH UM UH AGAIN THE N NEED TO LOOK AT THE THE THE TECHNICALITIES OF UM
ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER THE YOU KNOW THE POWER REQUIREMENTS OF THE UH SUCH A SOURCE
UM YOU KNOW COMPROMISE THE OUR OUR NEED FOR UH YOU KNOW IT IT BEING
UM MM PERMANENTLY
UH YOU KNOW AVAILABLE
UH WHETHER WHETHER DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY UM I MEAN TH ALL ALL THESE REMOTES ARE PRESUMABLY INFRARED AND LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME
UH WE WE POSSIBLY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AT AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT UM YOU KNOW SHORT RANGE
NOT LIKE THE OLD UH RADIO REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE YOU'D CHANGE NEXT DOOR'S TELLY WHEN YOU CHANGE YOURS
UM
BUT UH UH I THINK BASICALLY I IF WE'RE GOING FOR I IF MINIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS IS OUR PRIORITY THEN WE SHOULD AS I SAY
R KNOW REALLY BITE THE BULLETS AND AND REDUCE THE BUTTONS TO ABSOLUTE MINIMUM YOU KNOW POSSIBLY WITH BACKUP CHANNEL AND VOLUME BUTTONS AND ON OFF
UM AND NOTHING ELSE
UM SO THAT IT CAN AL IT COULD UH ALMOST END UP LIKE THAT BUT AGAIN EXCEPT THAT UM YOU KNOW THE RISK OF LOSING IT
UM ANYWAY OKAY UM SO KATE WH WHAT ARE YOUR UH YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS
OKAY
UH IT SEEMS SEEMS TO ME THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS TO MAKE BEFORE WE UM I THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT THE THE BIG ENERGY SOURCE IS UH A VERY VALID ONE
UM I DON'T SUPPOSE WE'VE GOT ANY STATISTICS ON THE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS PARTICULARLY SORT OF INDEPENDENT ONES
UM GIVEN
YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU BUY THESE DAYS WHICH YOU KNOW HAVE A A A LITHIUM WHATEVER BATTERY IN
THAT'S UH YOU KNOW NEVER NEEDS REPLACING
UM PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE THE THE DISPOSABLE REMOTE CONTROL UH UM YOU KNOW ONE SOME SORT OF TYPICAL USAGE
YOU KNOW THE THE THE BATTERY WILL LAST
KNOW FIVE TEN YEARS
BY WHICH TIME I MEAN WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE THE DIGITAL TELEVISION
WILL BE TAKING OVER IN THAT TIME SCALE
UM
UH UH P PERHAPS WE SHOULD KNOW REDUCE THE UH YOU KNOW
THE SORT OF MOVING PARTS EVEN MORE BY NOT EVEN HAVING A BATTERY COMPARTMENT AND UH
YEAH AND IF IF ANYBODY MANAGES TO RUN IT DOWN WE'LL WE'LL GIVE 'EM A NEW ONE
UM IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT IT SAVES IN COST AND YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A MARKETING GIMMICK
I MEAN IT'S HARDLY A GIMMICK IT'S UH IT'S TOTALLY PRACTICAL
UH SO I TH THINK YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF A RECHARGEABLE ONE IS UM
UH UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY HIGH TECH AND IT SORT OF JUST RECHARGES ITSELF IF IT'S N BY YOU KNOW MAGNETIC WAVES OR WHATEVER IF IF IT
YEAH
ARE ARE PEOPLE REALLY GONNA USE IT THOUGH
UM
I I TH I THINK
YEAH
IT'S UM I MEAN I KNOW THAT SOMEI TIMES MY MY WIFE GOES OUT IN THE MORNING AND SAYS OH I SHOULD HAVE PUT THE PHONE ON TO CHARGE AND THEN THEN SHE'S HAD THOSE FOR SO LONG THAT IF SHE HASN'T WORKED THAT OUT BY NOW
UM
WHEN IT YEAH WH WHEN IT'S DIED IS A PROBLEM
YEAH YEAH YEAH SO UH UM WHAT SO WH WHAT WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THE UM THE THE PERMANENT MM BATTERY
IS THE UH YOU KNOW WE WE WE ARE REALLY GOING FOR THE ULTIMATE IN EX UH EXTERNAL SIMPLICITY HERE
UM YOU KNOW CUT COST WITHIN THE
MANUFACTURING AND UH
YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE A HIGH TECH INTERIOR THEN THEN THAT THAT SH MAY WELL BE COST EFFECTIVE
I MEAN TH TH CERTAINLY
UM I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING OFF THE S TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY THINGS THAT YOU BUY
I MEAN CALCULATORS FOR EXAMPLE
SOM WELL SOME DO I MEAN TH TH BUT THERE ARE BATTERY ONES THAT UM ARE YOU KNOW SORT OF PERMANENTLY SEALED
IN IN FACT I'D
YEAH UH UH
YEAH I I MEAN TH TH THIS NEEDS GOING T INTO THE TECHNOLOGY A BIT
I MEAN THE THE ACTUAL TIME THAT A REMOTE CONTROL IS ACTUALLY OPERATING
I WOULD THINK IS
I IS IS PROBABLY YOU KNOW NO MORE THAN MINUTES IN ITS ENTIRE LIFE
UM
IF BUT I SAY IF IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING R. S. I. FROM IT THEN UH THEN UH THEN THEN PERHAPS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WRONG MARKET N
RIGHT
OH I MUST ADMIT I HADN'T UM I'D I'D MISSED THAT
THAT DOES SOUND EXCESSIVE
YEAH
WELL THAT'S RIGHT
AND AND I I DON'T I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER THE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER THE S THE SIGNAL LASTS AS LONG AS YOU ACTUALLY KEEP THE BUTTON PRESSED
OR WHETHER IT'S JUST A
SORTA TENTH OF A SECOND NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU PRESS IT FOR I DON'T KNOW I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW
UM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
RIGHT SO I'VE GOT A MESSAGE TO SAY FIVE MINUTES I DUNNO HOW LONG AGO THAT APPEARED
UM 'CAUSE WE'RE WE'RE GETTING UM RIGHT SO I'D I NEED TO SUM UP VERY QUICKLY HERE UM
WE'RE LOOKING AT EXTREME SIMPLICITY
WE'RE LOOKING AT A
RADICALLY DIFFERENT SHAPE
POSSIBLY NO BUTTONS AT ALL UM BUT IF YOU CAN INCORPORATE UM
CHANNEL CHANGE AND VOLUME BUTTONS UM IN INTO THE DESIGN THEN THEN THAT'S FINE
UM IN THE I MEAN THE THE ROLE OF THE OF THE UM THE USER INTERFACE DES DESIGNER BECOMES B YOU KNOW MORE IMPORTANT HERE
BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHAPE IS NO LONGER AN
A UH UM A SERIOUS CONSTRAINT
BUT WE CLEARLY ONLY NEED TH THE MAIN BUTTONS ALTHOUGH UH IF CLEARLY ONLY NEED THE MAIN FUNCTIONS
UM I DON'T SEE WHY WE SHOULDN'T GO FOR VOICE RECOGNITION UM AND THE THE ONLY BUTTONS THAT I THINK WE NEED ARE CHANNEL CONTROL
VOLUME CONTROL AND ON OFF
UM IT NEEDS TO INCORPORATE THE CORPORATE LOGO UH THE THE GREY AND YELLOW COLOUR SCHEME AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T INTRODUCE UM INTERCHANGEABLE
UH COVERS
UM UH D SO DOES THAT ACCURATELY SUMMARISE WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED
RIGHT
SO UH
YEAH
WE ARE DOING JUST THE TELEVISION
NO
I THINK THAT'S QUITE CLEAR FROM THE THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN NO
RIGHT
OH YEAH WELL TH THAT'S ONE I S THAT'S ONE I SENT YOU
WHICH WHICH WAS MY INTERPRETATION OF UH OF THE UH WHAT CAME DOWN FROM FROM HEAD OFFICE
UM
THAT'S THAT THAT THAT THAT'S THEIR UH THEIR VIEW
OKAY SO UH WE CAN ALL GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO THAT UH FOR FOR THE NEXT MEETING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
MM
MM
MM
MM
P
WELL THE ONLY PROBLEM I CAN THINK OF WITH THAT IS IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANNA BE BOTHERED LEARNING HOW TO USE NEW REM REMOTE CONTROLS
IF YOU JUST KIND OF TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE USED TO KNOWING THAT'S GONNA BE QUITE A CHANGE
IT MIGHT
MM
MM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT LOOK AT THE IMPORTANCE OF THEM
THE VOLUME SETTINGS
YEAH
THEY'RE NOT USED OFTEN BUT THEY ARE QUITE IMPORTANT WHEN THEY'RE USED
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
MM
HMM
OH YOU HAVE TO HIT LIKE FUNCTION AND F. SOMETHING
F. EIGHT
DUNNO
OH YEAH IT'S GOING
OH YEAH THEY MIGHT BE MOVABLE
OH YEAH THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED TO ANYTHING ON THE TABLE YOU JUST LEAVE 'EM ON AND WALK AROUND WITH 'EM
MM
MM
YES MM
WHICH ONE DOES THIS PLUG INTO
THAT ONE
I CAN'T DID YOU COULD YOU SEE IT ON YOU SCREEN WHEN IT
THAT'S NOT COOL
OH WELL
ANYWAYS
UM ALRIGHT YEAH SO UM I'LL JUST DO MY PRESENTATION ON THE WORKING DESIGN UH
OH THERE WE GO
OKAY UM JUST AT THE M YEAH THE WHOLE SORT OF METHOD OF HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL WORKS
UH THE BASIC FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO ANOTHER SH SYSTEM THE THE T. V. OR THE D. V. D. PLAYER OR WHATEVER
UM AND IT DOES THIS UH BY WELL
YOU NEED TO START OFF YOU NEED AN ENERGY SOURCE AND THIS ENERGY SOURCE WILL FEED INTO AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIP AND THE CIRCUIT CHIP IS THE PART THAT ACTUALLY COMPOSES THE DIFFERENT MESSAGES UH WITHIN THE REMOTE UM WHICH WILL THEN BE SENT TO THE UH THE TELEVISION
THE D. V. D. TO TELL THAT WHAT TO DO
UM AND YOU NEED A USER INTERFACE
WHICH CONTROLS THE CHIP AND THUS THE MESSAGES AND UH THE USER INTERFACE IS THAT'S BASICALLY JUST YOU KN THE S SORTA DESIGN OF THE ACTUAL REMOTE WHICH YOU HOLD IN YOUR HANDS AND WHAT BUTTONS WILL BE ON IT
UM
OH SHOOT
OKAY
UH JUST GENERAL FINDINGS
UH WHAT WE NEED UH TECHNICALLY SPEAKING FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SOME SORT OF ENERGY SOURCE
UH SOME SORT OF USER INTERFACE WHICH I THINK WE'VE MOSTLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE AND THE DESIGN OF THAT
UM A CIRCUIT CHIP WITHIN THAT TO UH CONTROL AND SEND THE MESSAGES AND UM A SENDER AND RECEIVER
AND UM OOPS
UH-HUH
THIS IS JUST SORT OF A LITTLE SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
UH THIS JUST KINDA REPRESENTS THE ENERGY SOURCE WHICH FEEDS INTO THE CIRCUIT CHIP UH WHICH MAYBE THEN WE COULD HAVE THAT FEED INTO A SWITCH WHICH WOULD SEND SIGNALS F TO UM A SUBCOMPONENT AND ON TO A LIGHT BULB BETWEEN SO IT'LL LIGHT UP ONCE WE START ONCE YOU START PRESSING BUTTONS
UM ALSO SEND SIGNALS TO THE UM INFRARED BULB WHICH WILL BE THE PART THAT ACTUALLY WHAT
SENDS SIGNALS TO THE THE TELEVISION
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR HAPPY LITTLE T. V. WATCHER THERE
AND SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES I I JUST THINK WE NEED SORTA BIG UH ENERGY SOURCE THAT WON'T DIE OUT
UH PERHAPS SOME SORT OF RECHARGEABLE BATTERY OR A BATTERY DOCK YOU COULD PLACE IT IN
SO IT'D CONSTANTLY BE CHARGED SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO UH BE WORRYING ABOUT IT RUNNING OUT OF BATTERIES AND NOT CHANGING CHANNELS FOR YOU
UH A WIDE RANGE UH SENDER RECEIVER SO THAT YOU CAN HIT THE BUTTONS FROM BASICALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM AND THE CHANNEL'LL STILL BE CHANGED
UH ALSO DEFINITELY A USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE UM AND I THINK WE'VE ALL SORT OF MENTIONED ADDING A A LOCATING DEVICE ON IT
SO WHEN IT DOES GET STUCK UNDER THE COUCH CUSHIONS AS THEY INEVITABLY DO YOU CAN FIND THEM EASILY
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
MM
MM
MM
JUST HAVING ONE THAT'S GUARANTEED TO LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS
OH COOL
YEAH FAIR ENOUGH
MM MM
MM YEAH
MM MM
MM
'CAUSE I ONLY REMEMBER TO CHARGE MY CELL PHONE UH WHEN BATTERY DIES
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH YEAH
YEAH WHEN IT TURNS ITSELF OFF THAT'S WHEN I PLUG IT IN YEAH
YEAH THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM
THEY USUALLY HAVE THE LITTLE LIGHT UH SOURCE I DUNNO WHAT THE HECK THEY'RE CALLED THE BUT YEAH THE LITTLE CELLS THAT
YEAH
MM
MOST OF THEM DON'T THEY HAVE SORT OF A COMBINATION OF THE TWO
LIKE WHEN THERE IS LIGHT THEY'LL WORK OFF THE LIGHT AND IF THERE ISN'T
THEY'LL KICK INTO THIS BATTERY SO WE CAN MAYBE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEREAS THERE IS A BATTERY
BUT IF THERE'S ENOUGH LIGHT THEN IT'S USING THE LIGHT SO THAT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY DRAINING THE BATTERY ALL THE TIME
BUT YOU WILL HAVE THE BATTERY THERE FOR WHEN YOU NEED IT
MM
MM
OH IT DEPEND IF IT'S UH DEPENDS WHO WHO'S USING IT WHO'S JUST SITTING THERE CLICKING CLICKING CLICKING CLICKING YEAH
YEAH THEN THEY'RE CLICKING A LOT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
MM
YEP
HMM
MM
MM
YEAH
OKAY
COOL
SORRY
IT COULD BE OH UH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY UH MAYBE LIKE THE FLIP PHONES THAT THEY USE
HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW MO MOBILE PHONES THAT FLIP OUT AND THEY HAVE THE LIKE TEXTING AND THEN THE NUMBERS ON ONE SIDE
SO YOU COULD HAVE THE MOST USED BUTTONS ON TOP AND FLIP IT OUT OR SOMETHING
YEAH
THAT MIGHT BE THE
MAYBE I
YEAH
HAVE A BIG KIND OF LIKE THE SATELLITE BOX OR THE CABLE BOX AND HAVE IT JUST GO ON THE T. V. AND THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IN THE ROOM YOU ARE
YOU WON'T LOSE IT
NO
OH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
OKAY WELL I CAN DO MINE
YEAH LET'S SEE IF I CAN MAKE THIS WORK
UM
OH
IS IT DOING
OKAY
OH OKAY
OKAY SO THIS IS JUST ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
SO THE METHOD
I LOOKED ONLINE FOR EXAMPLES OF OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND THEN JUST KIND OF WAS TRYING TO BRAINSTORM SOME POSSIBLE DESIGN IDEAS AND UM IDENTIFY WHAT THE NECESSARY THINGS ARE
WHAT PEOPLE ARE WHAT YOU REALLY WANNA HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL DO
UM AND THEN THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS THAT I FOUND
THERE'S A USER CENTRED ONE AND AN ENGINEERING CENTRED ONE WHICH I WILL HAVE PICTURES OF AND THEN WE KINDA HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH ONE THIS SHOULD BE
SO THESE ARE THE TWO DIFFERENT ONES
THIS ONE UM THIS IS THE USER CENTRED IT HAS UH QUITE A FEW MM UH UM FEWER BUTTONS AND THEN THIS IS THE ENGINEERING CENTRED
WHICH HAS A LOT MORE BUTTONS AND PROBABLY THIS IS ONE THAT PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT ABOUT HAVING TOO MANY BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T USE
SO BASICALLY WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL IS IS YOU IT'S TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET
YOU KNOW TURN ON OFF SWITCH THE CHANNELS AND THE VOLUME AND THINGS SUCH AS THAT
AND SO FOR THIS PRODUCT IT'S GONNA BE TELEVISION ONLY AND THEN IT HAS TO HAVE THE UH LOGOS
FOR THE COMPANY AND THE COLOURS
AND SO FOR MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES I THINK THIS ONE IS EASIER TO USE AND HAS QUITE A YOU KNOW FEWER BUTTONS
UM WE WANT SOMETHING THAT SENDS MESSAGES EASILY TO THE TELEVISION AND I WAS KIND OF WONDERING ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE THAT THEY HAVE
IT LOOKS KIND OF NARROW AT THE TOP AND I WAS THINKING MAYBE IF IT WERE WIDER AT THE TOP THEN THAT WOULD BE EASIER
UM AND SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT'S GONNA MAKE OUR PRODUCT DIFFERENT
E THE UNIQUE STYLE MAYBE HAVE IT LIGHT UP SO IT'S VISIBLE IN THE DARK
UM THE CHANGEABLE FACE PLATES AND THE LIGHTING UP AND VISIBLE I WAS WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVI LOSING IT
MAYBE TO HAVE A BUTTON ON THE TELEVISION THAT YOU PRESS AND IT MAYBE IF IT MAKES A NOISE OR LIGHTS UP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO IT'S EASIER TO FIND IF SOMEONE HAS HIDDEN UNDER THE COUCH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO THAT'S MY PRESENTATION
YEAH
F THEY PROBABLY CLIP TO YOU
OH
HMM I THINK IT'S ALL THERE
H
OH YEAH
THAT'S KIND OF STRANGE
YEAH PEOPLE ARE PRO I WOULD THINK THAT PEOPLE MIGHT FORGET I MEAN PEOPLE FORGET TO PUT THEIR CORDLESS PHONES BACK ON THERE SO
YEAH
NO
UM
DO THEY MAKE BATTERIES THAT LAST THAT LONG
YEAH THEY HAVE THAT LITTLE SOLAR
YEAH
MM
YEAH SOME PEOPLE ARE
YEAH
YEAH
PER HOUR
WOW
THAT'S A LOT
YEAH
THOUGH I THINK WITH DIGITAL T. V. LIKE I KNOW ON MY CABLE BOX
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE CHANNEL CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT IF YOU JUST PRESS IT LIKE THAT
SO YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE THE MENU AND GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT
CHANNELS THAT WAY INSTEAD OF
UH OH
YEAH
UM
OH I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION
SO ARE WE DOING JUST THE TELEVISION OR ARE WE DOING SO NOT D. V. D. PLAYERS WE OKAY OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OH OKAY
OKAY
UH I DON'T MIND
UH CAN I STEAL THE CABLE
CHEERS
I GOT A HOW DO I START THERE
THAT ONE
COOL
WELL THESE ARE FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS FROM THE OUR OUR GUYS DOWN IN THE THE RESEARCH LAB
TOOK HUNDRED PEOPLE AND COVERED ALL THE ASPECTS OF WHAT UM IS NEEDED BY PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE
UM EVERYTHING KINDA FROM FUNCTIONALITY AND HOW INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS ARE HOW MU HOW HOW OFTEN THEY'RE USED AND HOW MUCH THEIR NECESSARY AND STUFF
AND GENERAL OPINIONS ABOUT CURRENT CURRENT REMOTES
SEE THAT AS WE KINDA NOTICED SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE FIND THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
SO SOME KIND OF A NEW STYLE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED THAT'S LESS UGLY
UH ALONG WITH UM LOOKING LESS UGLY IF IT LOOKS BETTER EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY'D SPEND MORE MONEY ON IT
WHICH IS A A PLUS FOR US IF WE CAN MAKE IT LOOK BETTER IT'D BE UH
MORE COST EFFECTIVE
AND WE CAN PUT THE PRICE UP
CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER
I CAN EMPL I KINDA TAKE THAT TO MEAN AS UM
THEY
THEY DON'T UH THEY YEAH
THEY ONLY USE THEY ONLY WORK FOR THE TELEVISION OR YEAH LIKE AS IN IN MY FLAT I'VE GOT SIX REMOTE CONTROLS FOR A STEREO SYSTEM
A DIGITAL BOX A D. V. D. PLAYER A VIDEO PLAYER AND T. V.
IF IT WAS UH I MEAN TH MY BEHAVIOUR IS TO USE MULTIPLE THINGS AT THE SAME TIME AND MULTIPLE REMOTES AREN'T REALLY MATCHED WELL TO MY BEHAVIOUR
UH AGAIN SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT IS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS SAY THEY ZAP A LOT
I TOOK TO MEAN THAT THEY JUST THEY USE IT A LOT THEY USE IT REGULARLY RATHER THAN STANDING UP AND
MANUALLY CHANGE CHANNELS OR VOLUME
AND UH
YEAH UH I THINK THE BIG ISSUE IS FIFTY PERCENT USERS ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
'CAUSE UH WH IF WE GOT A REMOTE THAT LIKE WELL WE'LL HAVE SOME BUTTONS TAKEN OFF BY THE LACK OF TELETEXT
BUT UH OH AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE UH ON THE UH THAT SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS LIKE AUDIO SETTINGS AREN'T H HARDLY EVER USED AND USED VERY AREN'T CONSIDERED RELEVANT BY THE USER
SO I THINK MAYBE FEWER BUTTONS WHICH ALSO MAKE THE DESIGN LOOK SLEEKER I DUNNO
UH UM YEAH AND
UH FRUSTRATIONS OF LIKE PEOPLE LOSING REMOTE CONTROL
I DUNNO MAYBE SOME KIND OF SYSTEM OF YOU PRESS A BUTTON ON THE T. V. OR MAYBE THAT'S B IT WOULD HAVE TO INCORPORATE
BUT LIKE SOME KIND OF SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN F USE SOMETHING ELSE TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL
MAYBE LIKE IT'LL BEEP OR SOMETHING
AND UM YEP THE UH TIME TAKEN TO LEARN NEW REMOTE CONTROLS IS
UH DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT TOO COMPLICATED EASY TO USE FOR UH NEW LIKE FIRST TIME USERS AND STUFF
AND UH REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE AND MAKE MA POSSIBLY EVEN USE HAVE TO MAKE IT
YEAH FEWER BUTTONS LIKE I WAS SAYING ABOUT THE WHOLE MICE THE MOUSE IDEA OF IT FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE
MAYBE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HOLD IT AS SUCH
BUT UH YEAH
IT ALSO ASKED UM IF WE WOULD IF PEOPLE WOULD PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION AND YOUNGER PEOPLE SAY THEY WOULD
AND UH THERE WAS ANOTHER SECTION ON OUR ON THE REPORT FOR UH L. C. D. DISPLAYS BUT THE DATA WASN'T THERE SO
I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS FOR THAT WERE SO
MAY BE INCREMENTALLY EMITTING BUT YEAH
AND UH IT WOULD CUT OUT THE R. S. I. AS WELL IF YOU
YEAH UM OH YEAH SO POSSIBLY THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS POSSIBLY SOMETHING COULD ADD INTO THE DESIGN
OH I'VE GOT SOME OTHER THINGS I COULDN'T FIT ONTO THIS PRESENTATION
UM
YOU SEE THIS OKAY
ALMOST NO
IT'S SORRY IT'S A BIT
I'LL READ OUT TO YOU
UH FUNCTIONALITY UH LIKE PEOPLE'S OPINIONS ON FUNCTIONALITY THE RELEVANCE TO THE REMOTE AND HOW OFTEN THEY'RE USED
SO UM
LIKE THE POWER
USING THE USING THE D SWI THE POWER SWITCH TO SWITCH ON T. V. IS A HIGH RELEVANCE OF NINE BUT IT'S NOT FREQUENTLY USED
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
WHEREAS CHANNEL SELECTION WHICH IS VERY HIGH RELEVANCE IS USED THE MOST
SO M WE CAN MAYBE EVEN START TO CUT DOWN ON OR I WAS POSSIBLY EVEN THINKING OF A DESIGN THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE BUTTONS ARE HIDDEN FROM EVERYDAY USE
MAYBE LIKE UH A FOLDING LEDGE OR SOMETHING
SO THAT WE CAN MAYBE GO INTO THE CHANNEL SETTINGS AND THE AUDIO SETTINGS WHICH ARE LOW RELEVANCE AND RARELY USED
AND KEEP THE V VOLUME SELECTION AND CHANNEL SELECTION VERY EASILY
OH YEAH
YEAH LIKE THE ONE THAT LIKE SLIDES BACK AND THE BUTTONS ARE CONCEALED UNDERNEATH
JUST REMOVE THEM COMPLETELY
UH YEAH
UM NO THIS IS FOR PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
OR EVEN I MEAN YOU COULD EVEN JUST HAVE IT LEFT ON
YOU COULD JUST PUT IT DOWN ONCE ON TOP YOUR T. V. AND NEVER HAVE TO
YEAH
B. B. C. ONE
OH YEAH
MM MM
RELEVANCE OF TWO OUT OF TEN YEAH
YEAH
STAND OUT
UH I JUST HAD A THOUGHT ACTUALLY SORRY TO INTERRUPT
UH YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT UM IT COULD TECHNICAL PROBLEMS OF LIKE UH SOMEONE ON THE TELEVISION SAYING A CHANNEL NUMBER AND IT CHANGED WE COULD MAYBE HAVE LIKE AN ACTIVATION
WORD
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN I'VE SEEN THIS USED ON COMPUTERS BEFORE WHERE YOU JUST YOU ADDRESS THE REMOTE YOU ADDRESS THE COMPUTER AND THEN GIVE IT A COMMAND
OH I SEE
OH YEAH I SEE
MM-HMM YEAH
I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING OF THE POINT OF VIEW OF PEOP YOU COULD STILL LIKE LOSE THIS REMOTE
MM
OH NO I I INTERRUPTED YOU SORRY
OH OKAY
UM WELL I WAS JUST KINDA WRAPPING UP THERE
YEAH I WAS THINKING UM YEAH MAYBE SUCH THINGS ARE RELEVANT
WE COULD MAKE THINGS MUCH MORE F I THINK THE THE EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WOULD SPEND MORE ON UH A REMOTE UH THAT LOOKS BETTER
COMBINED WITH UH DECREASE THE OR TAKE OUT THE LIMITED FUNCTIO FUNCTIONS THAT WE DON'T REALLY USE MUCH
ALRIGHT TAKE OUT TELETEXT BUT AS FOR CHANNEL SETTINGS AND STUFF IT MIGHT IT MIGHT UM TURN PEOPLE SOMEWHE PEOP SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT THE WHOLE FUNCTIONALITY AWAY
BUT SINCE IF WE'RE MARKETING A MORE KIND OF FASHIONABLE APPROACH THEN IT'D IT WOULD BE FASHION AND FASHION OVER PRACTICALITY
OH WE COULD YEAH
WE C YEAH
WE COULD EVEN HAVE IT AS LIKE A YEAH THE BUTTONS CONTROL THIS AND THE VOICE FUNCTIONS CONTROL THE F THINGS THAT YOU WOULD DO ALL THE TIME
SO
SO UH YEAH IF WE COULD UH POWER ON AND CHANNEL SELECTION AND AND VOLUME SELECTION WOULDN'T HAVE TO REALLY
YEAH AND PROBABLY IT WOULD LOOK BETTER AS WELL
YEAH
YEAH
LINED WITH NUMBERED BUTTONS AND
UH YEAH YEAH THAT'S EVERYTHING
DO YOU WANT THE CABLE
F. EIGHT
UH GIVE IT ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS OR SO
YEAH
HMM
MM-HMM
IT COULD HAVE LIKE UH KNOW LIKE A CORDLESS PHONE IN YOUR HOUSE IT S GOT LIKE A BASE THAT SITS THERE ALL THE TIME
I SUPPOSE YEAH
YEAH
UH
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD YEAH
MM-HMM
W LIKE LIKE THIS UM THIS UH MARKET RESEARCH THING SAYS NUMBER OF TIMES PER HOUR THAT IT'S USED CHANNEL SELECTION A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT
TIMES PER HOUR
YEAH
BUT THEN AGAIN IF YOU THINK IT OF THE AMOUNT OF YOU KNOW AMOUNT OF USE IT'S LIKE
THAT'S IT'S LESS THAN A SECOND UM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH LIKE IN THE EMAIL OF TELEVISION ONLY
IN FACT THEY'RE IN THE CONSTRAINTS EMAIL THAT I GOT
DIDN'T YOU MENTION THE TELETEXT JUST TELEVISION ONLY
OH OKAY
OH YEAH
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THIS THIRD MEETING OF THE UH UH DESIGN GROUP
UM I THINK WE UH MADE SOME DEFINITE PROGRESS AT THE LAST ONE UM AND COME UP WITH SOME INTERESTING UH UH W SUGGESTIONS FOR OUR OUR NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UM I'LL AGAIN VERY QUICKLY UH JUST PRESENT SOME NOTES OF THAT MEETING
UM THE THE THE PROBLEM WITH EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS WE FELT WAS THAT THEY'RE UGLY UM AND THAT PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO PAY A PREMIUM FOR SOMETHING BETTER
UM THEY'VE GOT LOTS OF BUTTONS ON THEM THAT UH PEOPLE DON'T USE AND FIND DIFFICULT TO LEARN
UM AND PEOPLE LOSE THEM
AND
WE WE THOUGHT THAT F FOR OUR OUR NEW UH UH REMOTE CONTROL THAT EVERYBODY WILL WANT TO RUSH OUT AND BUY
UM THAT WE'RE WE SHOULD LOOK AT SPEECH RECOGNITION RATHER THAN R RATHER THAN BUTTONS
AND THAT IF WE HAVE ANY BUTTONS THEY SHOULD BE VERY FEW OF THEM AND ONLY FOR THOSE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED THAT THAT PEOPLE USE
THAT UM WE WANT TO GO FOR UH A LONG LASTING BATTERY THAT WE GUA WE GUARANTEE FOR THE LIFE OF THE UH UH THE PRODUCT AND A SHAPE THAT WILL BE INSTANTLY RECOGNISABLE
A. UM AS UH A TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL AND AND B. AS UH A REAL REACTION PRODUCT
SO THAT W UH WHEN PEOPLE ARE UH HAPPY WITH THAT THEY WILL THEY WILL WANT TO BUY UH EVERYTHING ELSE FROM US
UH
OKAY
SO AGAIN UM
I'LL WE'LL HAVE THE THREE THREE PRESENTATIONS FROM THE THE THE THREE OF YOU AND THEN UH WE'LL WE'LL MAKE A A FINAL A FINAL UH DECISION
UM AND THE THE DECISIONS THAT WE NEED TO TO MAKE TODAY FINALLY
ARE UM WHAT ENERGY SOURCE WE WANT TO USE WHETHER I IT IS PRACTICAL TO USE UH UM
A A A LONG LASTING ONE
AND UH I I THINK OUR DISCUSSION WAS AROUND THE FACT THAT UH IF WE'RE GONNA GO FOR UH A LONG LASTING POWER SUPPLY
THEN BASICALLY IT'S UH SEALED FOR LIFE AND UH IF ANYBODY DOES MANAGE TO RUN ONE DOWN WE'LL WE'LL GIVE THEM ANOTHER ONE
AND UH IT IT'LL BE UH YOU KNOW PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED AS PART OF THE TH THE ADVERTISING LITERATURE THAT IT'S UM UM
YOU KNOW FOR LIFE GUARANTEED FOR LIFE
UM NOW THE THE THE INTERNAL CHIP UM AND UH THIS IS WHERE I NEED UH UH KATE'S EXPERT ADVICE AND GIVEN THAT TH THIS HAS TO TO GO TO MARKET AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE UM D D DO WE GO FOR A CUSTOM DESIGNED CHIP
OR OR DO WE BUY ONE OFF THE SHELF AND AND PROGRAMME IT OURSELVES
UH I MEAN I'M I'M I'M
N NOT AN EXPERT ON THESE THINGS BUT PRESUMABLY THERE MUST BE LOADS OF 'EM ALREADY ON THE MARKET THAT WE CAN MODIFY
BUT UH THAT THAT'S UH THAT'S YOUR AREA OF EXPERTISE
AND THEN THE UH YOU KNOW THE THE OVERALL DESIGN OF THE CASE UH IS IS IS KENDRA'S FIELD AND UH
WE WE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS LAST TIME AS AS TO UH HOW WE MIGHT GO FORWARD AND WE'LL WE'LL FINALISE THOSE
UH DA TODAY
UM AND THI THIS IS ALL LINKED IN WITH THE THE THE USER INTERFACE WHETHER WE P UM
GO FOR VOICE BUTTONS OR OR A BIT OF BOTH
UH
AND THEN UH YOU KNOW F FOR THE NEXT MEETING KATE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE THE THE S THE LOOK
FEEL AND DESIGN KENDRA THE UH
HO HOW THE THE USER ACTUALLY USES IT AND AND ANDREW OF COURSE THE THE PRODUCT EVALUATION
AND UH KATE AND KENDRA WILL BE PRODUCING A A MODEL FOR US TO UH TO LOOK AT
UH SO IF IF WE CAN HAVE THE THE THREE PRESENTATIONS AGAIN PLEASE AND UH UM P PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO START UH K
KATE
OH I'M SORRY OH SORRY
OKAY SO HOW UM SORRY CAN YOU UH JUST PUT THAT ONE BACK UP AGAIN PLEASE
UM
UH D D D OKAY I MEAN UH INEVITABLY A B A CUSTOM DESIGN CHIP IS GONNA BE MORE EXPENSIVE
DO WE DO WE KNOW UH BY HOW MUCH
AND AND DO WE KNOW HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE TO UH DEVELOP A A CUSTOM CHIP
RIGHT OKAY
RIGHT I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE A A DECISION HERE
UH GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WANTS THIS ON THE MARKET QUICKLY AND CHEAPLY
THAT WOULD APPEAR TO UH EFFECTIVELY CONSTRAIN US TO AN EXISTING CHIP AND THUS THEREFORE CONVENTIONAL BUTTON TECHNOLOGY
UM UH NOW BEFORE WE GO ROUND EVERYBODY ELSE DOES ANYBODY UM
H HAVE ANY HAVE ANYTI HA ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT
CAUSE UH I MUST SAY I FIND IT SLIGHTLY SURPRISING GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW MOBILE PHONES INCORPORATE VOICE ACTIVATED DIALLING
SO UH UM I MEAN I D D FOR SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WELL NO I MEAN IT'S IF YOU YOU
SPEAK SOMEBODY'S NAME AND IT'LL DIAL THE NUMBER FOR YOU
SO UH BU I MEAN THE THIS THIS INFORMATION IS FROM IS THIS IS THE INTERNAL COMPANY INFORMATION IS IT
SO UH
YEAH MM TRUE AGAIN BUT IF IT'S WITHOUT ANY WITHOUT ANY UH P PRICE INFORMATIONS THAT'S UH DIFFICULT TO UH
UH DECIDE
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT
IT'S LIKE IT'S IT'S YOU CAN'T 'CAUSE MOBILE PHONES ARE EXPENSIVE YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S THE VOICE RECOGNITION BIT THAT IS
BUT WE DON'T KNOW
UM
I MEAN UH
I SU I I MEAN IF GIVEN THAT THE UM THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT WELL DEVELOPED AND AND GIVEN THAT IT'S IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
UM TH TH THE DOUBLE RISK
UH PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO UH STICK TO UH TO BUTTONS SINCE THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS PRESENT A PRODUCT THAT DOESN'T WORK
UM
THOUGHTS
I MEAN DO W DO WE THINK THAT THE VOICE TECHNOLOGY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PROJECT
I MEAN I THINK WE
MM
YEAH I I I I I THINK THAT'S UH
YEAH YEAH
MM RIGHT OKAY
YEAH IT SHOULD BE
RIGHT OKAY SO
FINE
OKAY
I IT WILL HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION UM UH IF IF THAT MEANS UH IF THAT MEANS WE CAN'T AFFORD BUTTONS BUT I MEAN B B SECOND QUESTION
DO WE NEED THE FIVE BUTTONS FOR CHANNEL CHANGE UP DOWN VOLUME UP DOWN AND ON OFF
JUST AS A A BACKUP OR JUST SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UH J J JUST SIT THERE PRESSING BUTTONS
RIGHT
OKAY
SORRY D DID YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING
NO
OKAY
SHALL WE MOVE RAPIDLY ON TO UH KENDRA
UH UM RA RAPIDLY MOVE THE CABLE OVER
MM
OH GOOD
MM YEAH IT'LL GET THERE
YEP
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
UH-HUH
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
SORRY Y Y YEAH IF I CAN INTERRUPT YOU
WELL D P 'KAY DO YOU WANNA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT UM SLIDE CONTROLS
I MEAN I THINK THE REASON EVERYBODY USES PUSHBUTTONS IS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE SI SIMPLE CHEAP AND RELIABLE
OKAY FAIR ENOUGH FINE
YEAH
GOOD GOOD
YEAH
SO THREE THREE THERE'S THREE BUTTONS ON A SLIDER
THREE BUTTONS CHANNEL UP CHANNEL UP DOWN AND
UH-HUH
OKAY
UM
MM-HMM
THIS ONE ON THE ONE SIDE AND ONE YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OR YEAH UH TH TH THE I MEAN THI THIS IS WHAT THE WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH IS THE THE ACTUAL SHAPE THAT PEOPLE CAN INS INSTANTLY PICK IT UP AND AND KNOW KNOW UH KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO
OKAY SO WE WE'RE LOOKING AT SLIDERS FOR BOTH A UH VOLUME AND CHANNEL CHANGE
OF ONE SORT
JUST FOR THE VOLUME UH
FINGERS YEAH
I MEAN IT'S IT'S
IT YEAH I MEAN IT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT UH IT UH IT AL ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT IT IT THE TWO ARE CLEARLY DIFFERENT
UM THAT THERE'S NO NO POSSIBILITY OF UH CONFUSING THE TWO
SO OKAY
RIGHT SO UH THAT'S SORRY IS THAT THAT ALL YOU WANT TO SAY AT THE MO OKAY FINE
MM RIGHT
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
WELL I I MEAN I TH I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING OUGHT TO ADDRESS ALL THREE OF THOSE
OKAY
UH-HUH
MM I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT THAT'S DIFFERENT CERTAINLY
WHAT
YEAH
UH
UH
ALSO MEANS YOU CAN DROP IT WITHOUT DAMAGING IT
I I MEAN IT ITS UH I THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA IT'S LIKE THE OLD SWATCH WATCH WHERE UH UM ON ONLY BATTERIES EVER GOT CHANGED IN THOSE
'CAUSE PEOPLE JUST BOUGHT A NEW ONE WHEN IT WENT OUT OF FASHION BUT IT'S JUST NEVER BEEN SEEN AS A A FASHION ITEM BEFORE
UM THAT'S YES IF IF IF THEY'RE MADE IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY
W I MEAN WE WE CAN UH UH B BUT I MEAN MY FEELING IS THAT CURRENT POWER SOURCES ARE SUCH THAT FOR RELATIVELY LITTLE COST YOU CAN MAKE IT LAST
YOU KNOW A LONG TIME
UM BUT IF WE ALSO MAKE IT CHEAP ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE EITHER CHANGE THE COVER EVERY YEAR OR EVEN BUY A NEW ONE EVERY YEAR THEN IT IT'S IT'S EVEN BETTER
S
YEAH YEAH
I N I KNOW THE ONLY P I MEAN THE THE THE THE IMMEDIATE THING THAT COMES TO MIND WITH THAT IS THAT IT IT IT Y YOU'VE THEN GOT THE CONNECTION AND YOU'VE IMMEDIATELY GOT A SORT OF UNRELIABILITY
WHEREAS THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING IT PLUMBED IN IS THAT THAT THE WHOLE THING IS ALL YOU KNOW
COMPLETELY SOLDERED TOGETHER AND IT IT IT YOU KNOW TOTAL RELIABILITY BUT I MEAN I D I I UH
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND UH UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM
I TH I S I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN THAT ROUTE THEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UH EVEN IF IT COSTS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THAT
UM JUST BUILDING THE WHOLE THING IN ONE THEN HAVING GETTING CHEAPER PRODUCTION COSTS UM AND
YOU KNOW GIVING PEOPLE THE OPTION OF BUYING A NEW UH A A COMPLETE NEW THING
THE ADVANTAGE OF A REPLACEABLE COVER IS THAT EVEN IF THEY DON'T IT DOESN'T HAVE A COVER ON AT ALL IT WILL STILL WORK UM TOTALLY
UM THEN IF YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE LOSE THE COVER
I MEAN THEY THEY MIGHT BE WELL INCLINED TO GO OUT AND SPEND HOWEVER MANY EUROS ON A ON A NEW ONE UM RATHER THAN A A COMPLETE NEW RE REMOTE
YEAH I MEAN IT IS IT'S UP TO IT'S UP TO
YEAH IT'S IT'S UP TO OUR MARKETING PEOPLE TO TO MA TO MA TURN IT INTO A A FASHION ITEM
UM AND YOU KNOW AS AS EXTERNAL FASHIONS CHANGE THEN WE GET NEW NEW COVERS ON THE MARKET AND YOU KNOW READILY AVAILABLE
AND UM
THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT YEAH YEAH
SO UH I SO UH OKAY
UM RIGHT SORRY
UM WE HADN'T FINISHED YOUR
IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE PROMINENT DIS DISPLAYED ON THEIR UM COFFEE TABLE TO SAY THIS SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT ME
UM THIS IS FASHIONABLE
I YOU KNOW I'M I'M I'M WITH IT I'M UP TO DATE
AND YOU KNOW TH THE THE DESIGN THAT I'VE GOT AND AND IT COULD BE A A HOME MADE DESIGN
UM YOU KNOW THIS SAYS THIS IS NOT JUST A A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL THIS IS YOU KNOW A FASHION ACCESSORY
UM
SO I MEAN THE THE THE BASIC SHAPE I IS IS WHAT WE UH I MEAN GIVEN THAT WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW ONE ONE ON OFF BUTTON PRESUMABLY
TWO BUTTONS FOR UH CHANNEL CHANGE AND ONE SLIDER AND BASICALLY NOTHING ELSE UM W WE NEED TO DECIDE ON THE JUST THE BASIC SHAPE OF THE THING
AND KNOW WHETHER WE GO DOWN THE FRUIT AND VEG ROUTE AND I DON'T SUGGEST WE MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A BANANA
BUT UM KNOW SORT OF THE THE ORGANIC
YOU KNOW CURVED LOOK YOU KNOW T TO DELIBERATELY GET AWAY FROM THE UH UM UH YOU KNOW
THE THE THE THE SQUARE LOOK OF MOST UM CURRENT UH REMOTES AND
YOU KNOW WHETHER WHETHER THE YOU KNOW THE THE FIXED PART OF IT IS THE CORPORATE YELLOW
UM
MM OR UH 'CAUSE THERE'S CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE THE CORPORATE LOGO NEEDS TO BE PROMINENTLY UH DISPLAYED SO THAT PEOPLE S TH LOOKED AT IT AND SAY RIGHT
THAT'S A REAL REACTION REMOTE CONTROL I WANT ONE OF THOSE
YEAH UH THE THE UH OR OR B
YEAH I'D I'D UM YEAH
UH NO I D I I AGREE I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SIMPLY IT'S SIMPLY REQUIRED TO INCORPORATE THE THE THE THE CORPORATE LOGO PROMINENTLY UM
WELL TH THIS IS THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT YES YOU KNOW
I'M I'VE GOT A A REAL REACTION UH REMOTE CONTROL TO GO WITH MY REAL REACTION COFFEE MAKER OR OR WHATEVER
AND UH THEN PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE DEMAND MORE REAL REACTION STUFF
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN I'VE UH YEAH
OH NO THAT WELL THERE'S THE SIM MY MY IDEA WAS SOMETHING A B PROBABLY YOU KNOW A BIT FATTER THAN THIS BUT SORT OF THA THAT SORTA SHAPE SO THAT YOU CAN JUST SORT OF HO HOLD IT
W IT I MEAN WELL IT'S SORT OF IT'S IT'S SORT OF UH A A MOUSE BUT HELD
YOU KNOW SO IT'S YOU SORTA HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND LIKE THAT I WITH YOU KNOW AND FIDDLING WITH THE BUTTONS
OKAY YEAH YEAH
IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT
I THINK WE D I THINK WE DECIDED THAT W WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING DOWN BOTH ROUTES
THAT UM THE WE N WE NEED THE THE MANUAL CONTROLS AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE OF THAT FORM BUT THAT UH YEAH
THEN YOU JUST BRING IT UP TO YOUR MOUTH AND JUST SPEAK TO IT YEAH YEAH
I TH I TH HONEST UH MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT IF IT'S NOT THERE PEOPLE WOULDN'T USE IT ANYWAY UM
IT'S CER IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE I MEAN
BUT THEY WE WE'RE GOING BEYOND W W GIVEN THE STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE WANT SOMETHING THAT WE KNO WE KNOW WILL WILL WORK UM
UH
YEAH
IF WE WE'RE I MEAN I'M GETTING A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THOSE FACILITIES AVAILABLE
UH UH UH
OKAY IF WE IF WE'RE GOING DOWN THAT ROUTE THEN
WE NEED SOME SORT OF DISPLAY
DO WE NEED SOME SORT OF DISPLAY
WE ACTUALLY USE THE TELEVISION OKAY
OKAY OKAY OKAY
YEP
MM YEAH
OKAY WE GOT FIVE MINUTES TO GO IN THIS MEETING
SO UM I D I THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY VERY CONVENIENTLY JUST UH COME TO UH A GOOD POINT TO S TO SUM UP UM
SO UM B B KATE AND KENDRA NOW GO AWAY AND UH PA PLAY PLAY WITH A BIT OF PLASTICINE OR PLAY DOUGH
WHATEVER IT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC
UM AND ACTUALLY PUT WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED INTO SOMETHING UH I WAS GONNA SAY CONCRETE
BUT THAT'S A SLIGHTLY INAPPROPRIATE WORD UM TO SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WE CAN SEE AND UM ANDREW N CAN GO AWAY AND TH TH THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN UH ACTUALLY MARKET THIS AS A CONCEPT AND NOT J NOT JUST A UH UM A A SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH CERTAINLY OF COURSE
I THINK I THINK WE DECIDED THAT WE'RE GONNA FOR FOR SIMPLICITY OF YOU KNOW
MANUFACTURING AND UH MAINTENANCE THAT WE WILL GO FOR A A LONG TERM BATTERY SOURCE UM
I YOU KNOW ON THE BASIS THAT UM THAT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING FOR MAKING IT A FASHION STATEMENT
THEN UH PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHANGE IT ANYWAY UH BEFORE I IT RUNS OUT AND UM MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT WE WE CAN AIM FOR A BATTERY THAT WILL LAST MOST PEOPLE FOR UH WE'LL SAY AT LEAST FIVE FIVE TEN YEARS AND THAT WE'LL W WE WILL GUARANTEE IT FOR FOR FIVE YEARS UM
WE'RE HAVING A
A CUSTOM CHIP BUT GIVEN THE THE WE'VE CUT THE FUNCTIONS DOWN UM THAT WILL HOPEFULLY NOT BE TOO PROBLEMATIC
BUT GIVEN THAT UM TECHNOL TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS IMPORTANT THEN WE NEED TO I'LL SAY IT AGAIN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATE
UM AND UH WE WE KNOW WE MUST RESIST ANY EFFORTS TO UH TO TRY AND WATER THAT DOWN UM
I I INTERCHANGEABLE CASE SEEMS TO BE UM UM IMPORTANT TO THE CONCEPT
UM IT IT SHOULD BE CHEAP YOU KNOW IF IF WE AVOID ANY YOU KNOW ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS
AND UH I YOU KNOW I IF WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME WAY OF OF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY PERSONALISE IT UH TO WHATEVER THEY WANT
THEN UH I MEAN UH UH THIS IS TOTALLY NEW
WE D WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER
THAT TO WHAT EXTENT PEOPLE DO IT OR NOT BUT IF THEY'VE AT LEAST GOT A A GOOD SELECTION OF UM COVERS THAT THEY CAN USE ANYWAY
AND UH AND IF IF WE CAN KEEP THEM YOU KNOW ROLLING THEN UH YOU KNOW
SO THEY CAN GET THEM IN THE SUPERMARKET WHEN THEY GO DOWN TO UM A ANY OF THE FAMOUS SUPERMARKETS I WON'T MENTION ANY MENTION ANY NAMES
UM IT'S UH IT'S GOOD FOR THE SUPERMARKET AND IT'S GOOD FOR US AND IT HOPEFULLY MAKES THEM FEEL BETTER
UM THE THAT I MEAN THAT'S NO BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SO FEW BUTTONS THAT IT THAT ACTUALLY MAKES THAT REDUNDANT
YEAH YEAH
AND THE YOU KNOW THAT THAT SOLVES ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF B OF BATTERY LIFE
'CAUSE THAT WOULD WELL THAT WOULD CLOBBER THE BATTERY LIFE SO NO
I MEAN GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE BUTTONS WE'RE HAVING IT'S ACTUALLY UH UH UNNECESSARY I THINK
AS UH AS WIDE CER CERTAINLY WIDER ANGLE THAN THAN CURRENT SO THAT IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT YOU KNOW
ANYWAY LIKE YOU'RE LIKELY TO AND UH IT'S UH YOU KNOW I I IT WILL WORK MOST OF THE TIME UM
NOT LIKE MY MY MUM WHO POINTS IT AT THE CEILING AND WONDERS WHY THE TH TH THE TELEVISION DOESN'T WORK
UM YEAH I MEAN I D I TH I SORTA ENVISAGED THAT IF IF THIS WAS THE THE THING
THEN SORT OF THE THE WHOLE OF THE TOP WOULD BE THE UH THE INFRARED UH
UM SO
YEAH 'CAUSE I MEAN THE R REALITY IS PEOPLE ARE THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE TELEVISION WHILST THEY'RE USING IT
THE CHANCES ARE SO IF IF THEY'RE HOLDING IT ANYWAY
THE THEY'RE REASONABLY LIKELY TO BE HOLDING IT TO USE IT THEN UH THEN THAT THAT'S THE SORT OF COVERAGE THAT WE WANT
UM OKAY D WE'RE ALL CLEAR WHERE WE GO FROM HERE
OKAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND I'LL S SEE YOU ALL AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES
OKAY
UM
UM P THERE WE GO
'KAY I'LL JUST BE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPONENTS DESIGN
AND
OKAY BASICALLY I JUST UH LOOKED AT WHAT EXACTLY DO REMOTES DO
UH BASICALLY THEY WAIT FOR YOU TO PRESS A KEY OR GIVE A VOICE COMMAND AND THEN THIS IS TRANSLATED UH INTO UH LIGHT SIGNALS WHICH ARE THEN SEEN BY THE T. V.
UH THE MATERIALS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AT UH THE TWO BIG ONES ARE THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIP AND THE BATTERY AND THE IN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIP UH WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A A DIODE TRANSISTOR OR RESONATOR
UH TWO MORE RESISTORS AND A CAPACITOR AND THE BATTERY WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A RESISTOR AND A CAPACITOR
UM
UH BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'LL PRESS A NUMBER OR GIVE A VOICE COMMAND AND THIS CREATES A A CONNECTION WITHIN THE THE REMOTE THAT ALLOWS THE CHIP THE CHIP THEN SENSES THIS CONNECTION AND PRODUCES A SIGNAL IN A MORSE CODE FORMAT
THIS SIGNAL'S SENT TO THE TRANSISTOR WHICH AMPLIFIES IT AND THEN SENDS IT ON TO THE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE AND UH WHICH IS THEN TRAI CHANGED INTO A INFRARED LIGHT WHICH IS SENT TO THE T. V. AND SORT OF SEEN BY THE T. V. AND WHICH UH CHANGES THE CHANNELS
UM
OH
UH COOL
UH SO AS FOR HOW WE SHOULD END UP UH USING THIS IN OUR REMOTE UH T COUPLE OF MAIN QUESTIONS ARE THE BUTTONS
UH Y THE FEWER BUTTONS YOU HAVE I GUESS THE FEWER INTERNAL CONNECTIONS AND INTERNAL CODES YOU'RE GONNA NEED
UM
HOWEVER UH TO N NOT HAVE BUTTONS OR TO USE A VOICE COMMANDS INSTEAD OF BUTTONS MIGHT MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS MORE DIFFICULT AND UH RAISE THE PRODUCTION COST
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
ALSO WE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE COMPANY CONSTRAINTS
AND THE COMPANY HAS INFORMED ME VIA EMAIL THAT UH THEY'RE EXPERTS AT PUSHBUTTONS AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST UH COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF PRODUCING IT
UM ALSO WITH BATTERY CONNECTIONS THE COMPANY HAS SOME LIMITS ON THE BATTERIES WE CAN USE
SO I WAS THINKING PERHAPS A COMBINATION OF SOLAR CELLS WITH A BACK UP BASIC BATTERY AND SOMEHOW BETWEEN THE COMBINATION OF THAT TWO WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT UH WILL LAST THE THE LIFETIME OR THE FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND WE COULD STILL KEEP THAT ORIGINAL IDEA
UM WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE CHIPS UH V CUSTOM DESIGNED VERSUS OFF THE SHELF
AND THE CUSTOM DESIGNED WILL GIVE US MUCH MORE FLEXIBILITY AND ENABLE US TO INCORPORATE THE VOICE FUNCTION THAT WE ALL UH SEEM TO HAVE AGREED UPON
UM HOWEVER THAT'S GONNA COST MORE
BUT UH THE OFF THE SHELF IS GONNA BE UH CHEAPER AND IT'S GONNA BE ALLOW US TO PRODUCE IT QUICKER AND GET OUT THERE FASTER
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE LESS FLEXIBLE WITH THE FEATURES ESPECIALLY THINGS LIKE UH VOICE ACTIVATION
WHICH HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN USED MUCH ON REMOTES SO THERE'S NOT REALLY CHIPS OUT THERE THAT WOULD BE EASY TO UH TO CONVERT
SO IF WE WERE UH DEFINITELY GONNA GO WITH THE THE VOICE OPTION WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO DESIGN UM OUR OWN CHIP
AND THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP
MM
OH YEP SORRY
YEP
MM
UM I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY PRICE INFORMATION NO
UM IT A LOT LONGER THAN AN OFF THE SHELF CHIP
OH W YEAH WE DID THE THE PROBLEM IS THE THE THE VOICE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT REALLY HIGHLY DEVELOPED
IT'S SORT OF STILL STILL IN AN EX EXPERIMENTAL FORM
UH SO IT WOULD UH IT'S HARD TO PREDICT THE TIME
MM
W JUST TO TO INCORPORATE THE VOICE ACTIVATION IN IT IS IS SORTA THE TRICK
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE VOICE CHIP IN THERE THEN IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE THE WORLD THE THE SKY IS YOUR LIMIT
BUT TO ACTUALLY THE THE BIG STEP IS TO ACTUALLY GET THE VOICE ACTIVATION CHIPS IN THERE AND WORKING
UH BITS OF IT YEAH
YES AS WELL
MM
UH IT'S FUNDAMENT WELL I MEAN I GUESS IT IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE DISCUSSED UH SINCE THE THE SORT OF THE BEGINNING
SO I TH I THINK IN IN OUR IN OUR MINDS IT'S IT'S FUNDAMENTAL
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE UH THE UPPER ECHELONS OF THE COMPANY WOULD NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO
HM
MM
MM MM
MM
NO THAT SOUNDS GOOD
MM
MM
COOL
UM
YEAH I I WOULD SAY WE DO YEAH
UH NOPE THAT WAS IT THAT WAS IT
OKAY
YEAH IT'S THINKING ABOUT IT
YEAH
MM
UH
UH I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME COST REALLY
I I MEAN I THINK IT'S JUST SORT OF THE THE THERE'S A LOT OF SLIDE BUTTONS OUT THERE
I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SORT OF CONNECTION
MM YEAH
MM
MM
YE YEAH 'CAUSE I'VE DEFINITELY PICKED UP REMOTES AND LIKE MEANT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL AND TURN THE VOLUME
OR VICE VERSA SO IT'D BE KINDA GOOD TO HAVE THEM BE FEEL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
YOU'D KNOW WHAT YOU WERE FIDDLING WITH
YEAH
MM
MM
YEAH 'CAUSE IF YEAH IN THAT KINDA POSITION THE FINGERS WOULD BE BETTER FOR PRESSING AND THE THAT FOR ROLLING JUST THE WAY IT WOULD
MM YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM
MM
MM-HMM
WELL THAT CAN KINDA TIE INTO OUR CHANGING UH FACE THINGS
LIKE WE COULD HAVE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE THEME THIS YEAR AND UH WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT YEAR WE CAN HAVE THE FACE PLATES YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM YEAH THAT WEIRD I DUNNO WHAT THAT IS BUT YEAH
MM
UH YEAH IT'S GOOD AS WELL
MM-HMM
MM
MM
I
I THINK IT'S EASIER SOMETIMES TO HAVE THEM BUY CHANGEABLE COVERS FOR IT THAN TO BUY A WHOLE NEW ONE
BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE INVESTING IN A WHOLE NEW PRODUCT
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
MM
OH YEAH
I LIKE THAT
THAT ALL C ALSO KIND OF ENCOURAGES 'EM TO BUY NEW COVERS AND YEAH
UM
UH YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
WELL THAT THAT'S JUST IT WITH THE COVERS
YOU'RE SORT OF TRICKING 'EM INTO CONTINUING TO SPEND THEIR MONEY ON OUR PRODUCTS WITHOUT MAKING 'EM FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING RIPPED OFF HAVING TO BUY A NEW PRODUCT
SO YEAH
YEAH
MM
MM YEAH
MM
AND THAT'S THE SORT OF THING ONCE YOU GET THE MOULD SET YOU CAN JUST WHIP OUT DIFFERENT COLOURS DIFFERENT PICTURES VERY VERY QUICKLY
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY EXACTLY
YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
MM
I DUNNO THAT WE SHOULD MAKE THE WHOLE THING YELLOW I KINDA THOUGHT WITH A YOU'D HAVE LIKE A YELLOW CIRCLE WITH THE R. R. IN IT SOMEWHERE ON IT
BUT I'D YELLOW SEEMS A BIT OF A STRONG COLOUR TO MAKE THE ENT LIKE THE THING NO
BUT I MEAN JUST LIKE WHITE OR GREY OR BLACK OR SOME SORT OF BLAH COLOUR
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH YOU'D WANT IT NARROWER THAN A MOUSE THOUGH 'CAUSE IT A MOUSE YOU'RE KINDA JUST RESTING ON IT YOU WANT SOMETHING YOU CAN DEFINITELY GRIP
SO MAYBE IT'D BE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND FIDDLE AROUND WITH IT AND PRESS IT
MAYBE ALMOST LIKE A HAIRBRUSH
LIKE YOU COULD GET THE ABOUT THE WIDTH OF THAT END OF THE PEN AND THEN IT WIDENS UP TOP AND YOU CAN FIDDLE AN YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH COOL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
BUT DO YOU KNOW THIS SHAPE ALSO KIND OF LES LEND ITSELF TO TO VOICE 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE YOU'RE HOLDING IT AND YOU'RE FIDDLING
BUT YOU CAN ALSO BRING IT UP LIKE THAT AND IT'S MICROPHONE ESQUE YEAH YEAH
MM
BU
MM
WELL YOU CAN STILL I INCORPORATE THE VOICE WITH WITH LESS BUTTONS
I MEAN UH IF THE POWER BUTTON WAS ALSO SOMEHOW LIKE A MENU BUTTON YOU COULD PRESS THAT AND OR DO VOICE COMMANDS
AND EITHER VOLUME THING COULD ALSO BE TO SCROLL THROUGH OTHER OPTIONS LIKE Y AND YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH BRIGHTNESS AND AND SC AND THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN MINIMISE THE BUTTONS AND STILL HAVE THOSE
YOU KNOW BRIGHTNESS AND TINT AND STUFF
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THE TELEVISION WOULD BE THE DISPLAY THAT THINGS LIKE THAT USUALLY C POP UP ON A TELEVI LIKE YOU HIT MENU AND MENU WILL COME UP ON TELEVISION AND HAVE LIKE TINT BRIGHTNESS
AND YOU'D USE THE SCROLL SCROLL THROUGH IT YEAH
YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW THAT WORKED THOUGH BUT YEAH
YEAH MM
MM OKA YEAH
YEAH
COOL
PLAY WITH PLAY DOUGH
MM
YEAH
MM
MM
MM DOES ACTUALLY YEAH YEAH
MM DIFFERENT TO FEEL YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEP YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH MM
MM
YEP SOUNDS GOOD
'KAY
'KAY
I
I JUST HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT
UM DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THERE ARE JUST A FEW COMMANDS
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU UM CAN PRE PROGRAMME IN LIKE NUMBERS ONE THROUGH TEN AND PRE PROGRAMME SAY YOU KNOW
NINE CHANNELS AND THEN JUST USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO SAY CHANNEL ONE AND THEN YOU'VE PROGRAMMED IN SAY B. B. C. FOUR AS YOUR CHANNEL ONE
AS YOUR FAVOURITE IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FAVOURITES UM AND THAT W
OKAY
THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OF COURSE MOBILE PHONES DO TEND TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OR SOMETHING
AS OPPOSED TO THE TWENTY EUROS TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEAH
YEAH
WELL ANOTHER THOUGHT I OH SORRY GO AHEAD
OH YEAH
OKAY
WELL I KINDA THINK IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PART OF IT THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE IT FOR THE WHOLE THING
AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME
ANYWAY I'M I'M INCLI KINDA INCLINED TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD JUST GO FOR IT
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
I THINK SO
OKAY
LET'S SEE
OH
YES
IS IT GONNA WORK
OKAY
OKAY SO I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND UM WHAT YOU KNOW THE INTERF USER INTERFACE ARE JUST ASPECTS THAT ARE SEEN BY USERS
UM COMMANDS AND MECHANISMS FOR THE OPERATION AND THERE'RE JUST KIND OF A VARIETY OF CHOICES
UM FINDINGS
SO A LOT OF TIMES THEY TEND TO LOOK CLUTTERED AND THESE WERE JUST A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF UM DIFFERENT KINDS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE UNUSUAL
THERE'RE SOME SPECIAL ONES AVAILABLE LIKE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE WHICH IS MARKETED TOWARDS CHILDREN
UM DIFFERENT DESIGNS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT N WE NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR IS A V. IN VOLUME BECAUSE PEOPLE SOME
BRING A LITTLE PICTURE OF WHAT I THOUGHT OURS COULD LOOK LIKE
SO JUST KIND OF MINIMISE THE CLUTTER
AVOID TOO MANY BUTTONS AND ALSO UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE USED IS A SLIDE BUTTON LIKE YOU HAVE ON A MOUSE
THAT POSSIBLY WE COULD USE THAT ON THE SIDES FOR VOLUME FOR EXAMPLE HAVE THE SLIDE BUTTON ON THE SIDE
AND THEN YOU CAN PRE PROGRAMME THE CHANNELS THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND THEN THE VOICE RESPONSE SAMPLE LOCATOR
JUST BECAUSE I N FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M USING A MOUSE I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SLIDE IT UP AND DOWN SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR VOLUME TO JUST BE ABLE TO KIND OF ROLL IT AND THEN HAVE THE UP AND DOWN AND THEN THE THIS IS MY GREAT LITTLE DRAWING
Y YES YES
YEAH
THE ONLY ADVANTAGE I WAS THINKING OF TO HAVING THE BUTTONS LIKE THE BUTTONS ON ONE SIDE FOR THE CHANNEL
AND THEN THE SLIDER IS THAT IF YOU'RE JUST HOLDING IN YOUR HAND AND YOU PICK IT UP
IT'S EASY TO N S KNOW OKAY THIS IS JUST THE VOLUME AND THIS IS THE CHANNEL
YEAH
THAT WAS
YEAH
UM WELL I WAS THINKING KIND OF JUST FOR THE VOLUME BUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
WE COULD
YEAH YEAH
B
YEAH
YEAH
I'M JUST GONNA PASS THIS ALONG
YES
YEAH
YEAH
OH
YEAH
YEAH LIKE THE KIND YOU GET ON LIKE HAND WEIGHTS
YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF SPONGY YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
WH
WHAT IF WE INCLUDED THE BATTERIES IN THE COVER
SO UM LIKE
YEAH SO CAN I SEE THAT THING
JUST THIS AS EXAMPLES
SO F
YEAH I GUESS THAT'S
TRUE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH JUST ANOTHER FIVE EURO TO GET
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH LIKE THEY HAVE FOR MOBILE PHONES THAT ARE JUST FRUITS AND ANIMAL PRINTS AND COLOURS
YEAH OKAY
YEAH LIKE AN
YEAH
YEAH
WELL N
WELL I WAS SORT OF MM KINDA PICTURING LIKE MAYBE UM A SHAPE THAT'S ALMOST LIKE A MOUSE
SO THAT YOU KNOW
WHEN THEY HOLD IT IT'S BECAUSE A MOUSE IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD IN YOUR HAND UM MAYBE WE COULD MAKE IT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SHAPE SO THEY COULD HOLD ON TO IT
BUT THAT WAY THEY CAN HAVE THE VOLUME ON THE SIDE AND THEN THE CHANNEL BUTTONS AND
HAVE THE POWER WHEREVER SOMEWHERE
I MEAN THAT WAS JUST AN IDEA THAT I HAD
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE
KIND OF A C
YEAH
SORT OF A COMBINATION
YEAH
YEAH SO YEAH KIND OF MAYBE MAYBE A LITTLE WIDER THAN THIS 'CAUSE THIS IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE TO HOLD AND THEN IF YOU HAD
YEAH THEN WIDER UP HERE
AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE A L UH WIDER THING TO UH HAVE THE LIGHT
THE INFRARED LIGHT AT THE T. V. AND JUST KINDA CHANGE CHANNELS AND ADJUST THE VOLUME AND THE POWER COULD BE WHEREVER UP UP THE TOP OR SOMETHING
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THAT
OH YEAH
IT IS A VERY GOOD POINT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND JUST SAY
YEAH I SUPPOSE I SUP
SO I GUESS WE COULD HAVE A MENU BUTTON AS WELL
WE COULD HAVE THE CHANNELS AND THE POWER AND THEN A MENU BUTTON AND THEN THE VOLUME
SO HAVE FOUR BUTTONS AND THE VOLUME INSTEAD OF THREE BUTTONS AND THE VOLUME
YEAH THAT'S ON THE T. V. YEAH
YEAH AND THEN Y
YEAH PRESS THAT IS T YEAH THAT MIGHT WORK
YEAH IT'S LIKE UM YEAH IT'S LIKE THE MOUSE WHERE YOU JUST KINDA CLICK IT
YOU JUST PRESS IT
YEAH AND YOU COULD JUST CLICK THAT TO SO IF YOU HAD LIKE THE MENU THEN YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH AND THEN CLICK IT TO SELECT
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
YEAH AND ESPECIALLY FOR MAKING THEM SO LIKE DIFFERENT AND
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE THIS OR LIKE THIS
YEAH KINDA LIKE THIS WHOLE
SO YOU COULD USE LIKE THIS AND IT WOULD GO
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
OKAY
ALSO LOTS OF MOBILE PHONES HAVE GOT A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THEM NOT JUST THAT SO
WOULD
OH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY MAYB MAYBE IT SH
LIKE UM
MAYBE WE CAN LIKE CUT CORNERS SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BRING IN OVER COST
UH YEAH IT'S THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT TO USERS THAT THE DEVICE SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
FROM UH MY PRESENTATION SHOW SO
UH TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
MM
WELL IF YOU G IF YOU IF YOU GOT A CHANNEL UP DOWN WE CAN HAVE A SLIDER IN THAT AS WELL
BECAUSE IF IT IF YOU NO IF YOU NOTICE ON THE THING IT IT KIND OF LIKE HAS GOT KIND OF IF YOU YOU KNOW IT S KIND OF LIKE STICKS
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN UP LIKE ONE UNIT IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
SO IT KINDA GOES UP ONE THEN Y LIKE YOU CAN KEEP ROLLING IT UP BUT IT'S LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE A COG OR SOMETHING
SO YOU KINDA TAKE IT UP ONE AT A TIME
D
OH
UH YOU COULD YOU COULD AS L AS LIKE A MOUSE YOU COULD
YEAH LIKE THE SHAPE OF IT ALMOST LIKE A MOUSE WITH A
DEP
I DUNNO IF IT DEPENDING ON THE FINAL SHAPE OF IT 'CAUSE YOU COULD HAVE LIKE
I DUNNO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN C CONTROL THE VOLUME WITH YOUR THUMB AND THEN YOU COULD CONTROL THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR FINGERS
OH YEAH YEAH
HERE WE GO
UH YEAH THIS IS MY REPORT ON TREND WATCHING
THE DATA'S COME OFF INTERNET UH FROM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR US ON THE TOP THREE THINGS WANTED BY THE CONSUMER
AND WE GOT REPORTS FROM PARIS MILAN ON NEW FASHIONS
AND UH
THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THE L THE LOOK IT HAS TO LOOK FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
UH INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL
THIS IS A ST WELL I WAS GONNA SAY YEAH TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SECOND ASPECT WHICH IS THE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOV INNOVATIVE UM SIDE OF IT
SO UH AND THE THIRD BEING EASY TO USE IS PROBABLY A GIVEN WE HAVE TO TRY AND INCORPORATE SO UH
UH EXACTLY YEAH
I S THAT OUT OF SEQUENCE
UH YEAH SORRY
UH YEAH AND UH FROM THE FASHION WATCHERS FROM MILAN AND PARIS HAVE SAID FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE AN IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHES AND FURNITURE AND SHOES
ET CETERA
UH SORRY CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE
AND UH
A SPONGY MATERIAL TO BE USED ON THE ON THE OUTSIDE
YEAH
BUT UH I WAS GONNA SAY UM YEAH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES UH IMPORTANT TO THIS YEAR UM IMPORTANT TO FURNITURE I'M JUST GONNA SAY
UH F LIKE IT'S IN IF IF FASHION IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE IT LOOKS FANCY THEN FASHION IS OBVIOUSLY THE LINE WE GOTTA BE GOING THROUGH
BUT FASHIONS DO DON'T LAST VERY LONG
MM
YEAH
YEAH WE CAN HAVE A SP LIKE A SPONGY SKIN ON IT AND THEN WE CAN JUST WHIP THAT OFF AND
A KIND OF YEAH
OH
YEAH
THAT'S C COOL
UM YOU HAVE WE COULD
IF WE COULD SAVE DEPENDING ON THE COST OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF YOU KNOW
COULD WE HAVE UH A CHEAPER B CHEAPER POWER SOURCE AND THEN JUST HAVE IT ANNUALLY RENEWED
INSTEAD OF HAVING A TEN YEAR GUARANTEE
WITH INTERCHANGEABLE COVERS COULD JUST BUY A NEW ONE EVERY YEAR A NEW ONE WHEN NEW FASHIONS COME OUT
YEAH
MM-HMM
OR WELL BUT LIKE UH LIKE MORE THAN JUST THE BATTERY LIKE A COMPLETE DIFFERENT LIKE YOU'VE ONLY GOT LIKE
YOU KNOW LIKE TH UH THIS BIT'S THE BIT YOU KEEP AND THIS IS THE EXPENSIVE BIT THIS IS LIKE THE CHIP AND THIS IS THE MICROPHONE
AND THEN THIS IS THE POWER SOURCE AND THE BIT EVERYONE SEES
AND THEN
YEAH YOU PROBABLY ARE RIGHT
UM OH DON'T WORRY IT'S ALL SAID I WAS JUST GONNA SAY UH YEAH
ARE WE GONNA MAKE THIS AS PART OF LIKE LIKE UH A PART OF THE F LIKE IT IT THE FASHIONS APPLY TO FURNITURE
SO ARE WE GONNA MAKE THIS PART OF THE FURNITURE
YEAH
THIS IS FASHIONABLE WITH
OH YEAH
AND MAKE THAT A FASHION SYMBOL AS WELL
YEAH THAT SOUNDS
UM I'M JUST I'M SUDDENLY REALISING THAT YEAH WE'RE DISCUSSING HOW MUCH HOW GOOD IT'S GONNA BE TO CHANGE CHANNELS T WE STILL CAN JUST TELL IT TO
I MEAN ARE WE ARE WE STARTING TO GET AWAY FROM THE THE VOICE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT
YEAH MAYBE WE COU LIKE W LIKE WE'RE LEAVING OUT THE BUTTONS FOR THE THE F LESS FREQUENTLY USED STUFF
BUT MAYBE WE COULD INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE VOICE
MM I SUPPOSE BUT T THERE IS THE OFF CHANCE THAT YOU KNOW TH THE BRIGHTNESS IS WRONG ON YOUR T. V. OR THE CONTRAST NEEDS CHANGING
HMM YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
WELL I MEAN ON A ONTO LIKE A MOUSE THE RU THE SCROLLING BUTTON
IS ACTUALLY A BUTTON AS WELL YOU COULD PRESS IT YOU COULD PRESS THAT AND HAVE IT AS A MENU BUTTON
UH YEAH
HMM
UH CAN I JUST GET SOME THINGS CLEAR JUST FOR MY SAKE
OUR ENERGY SOURCE IS GONNA BE
LONG TERM
COOL
UH
AND WE'RE HAVING A CUSTOM CHIP
AND INTERCHANGEABLE CASE
MM MM-HMM
AND UH ARE WE GONNA HAVE IT IL BEING ILLUMINATED FROM INSIDE ONTO THE BUTTONS OR
COOL
ARE WE HAVING IT THAT IT'S ANY ANGLE OR IS IT JUST
AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE
MM-HMM
RIGHT WELL
WELCOME TO THE WHAT SHOULD BE THE LAST OF THESE MEETINGS AND UH IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE UH DONE A GOOD JOB HERE AND UH
WE'LL JUST GO THROUGH THE THE FINAL UH THE FINAL DETAILS
UM OKAY OH THE UM
TH THE THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING UH I THINK WE'LL TAKE THOSE AS READ UM
OKAY THE UM TH THE THE NEXT UH THING WE WE WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THE UH TH HAVE A LOOK AT THE PROTOTYPES AND UH LOOK AT THE UH EVALUATION CRITERIA AND FINANCE AND THEN UH
UH JUST TIDY UP WITH PRODUCTION AND UM AND THEN WE CAN CLOSE
UM
SO F IF IF YOU'D LIKE TO UH PRESENT YOUR YOUR PROPOSALS
UH-HUH
YEP YEAH GOOD GOOD
UH-HUH
YEP RIGHT
UH-HUH
YEP YEP MM-HMM
UH-HUH
YEP YEP
YEP
SHOWING ME AGE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I C IPOD COVERS ARE LIKE
YEAH YEAH
UH-HUH
OKAY YEP RIGHT
OKAY
YEP
OKAY GOOD YEAH
YEP RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
I MEAN THA IT'S IT'S A DETAILED POINT I JUST WONDERED I MEAN H HOW WILL PEOPLE PUT THESE DOWN I WONDER
RIGHT
OKAY FOR SOME STRANGE RE REASON I HAD IT IN MY MIND THAT THEY'D PUT THEM DOWN VERTICALLY BUT UH UH
YEAH
UH NO BECAUSE PARTICULARLY IF THEY'VE DIF IF THEY'RE GONNA HAVE IT AS A YOU KNOW AS A FASHION ITEM UH I MEAN IT IT'S UH IT IT'S JUST I MEAN IT'S JUST A MINOR DETAILED POINT
BUT UM AS YOU SAY YOU CAN JUST MAKE THE BASE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER AND UH
YEAH AND UH IT JUST NEEDS ANOTHER UH ANOTHER LOGO SOMEWHERE IS IS IS IS ALL IT GIVES GIVES PEOPLE THE OPTION AND IF IF SAY IF THEY'VE GOT THEM UM BECAUSE ACTUALLY HAVE SEVERAL UPON THE UH
YEAH WELL
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S UH BUT UH NO THE THE THE OVERALL UH THE OVERALL CONCEPT IS UH YEAH YEAH NO NO I MEAN THAT'S THESE UH
YEAH
BUT UH YEAH BUT NO TH BUT THE YEAH THE THE THE
YEAH YEAH YEAH I MEAN IT IT'S UH WOULDN'T WOULDN'T DO THAT INDEED YEAH
BUT TH TH BUT TH YEAH TH B THE THESE WERE ALL MINOR MINOR UH MINOR DETAILS
I THINK THE UH THE BASIC CONCEPT I I IS IS ABSOLUTELY BANG ON AND THE I IT CERTAINLY MEETS OUR CRITERIA OF BEING UH OF YOU KNOW LOOKING DIFFERENT
UM SO GOOD THAT'S THAT THAT'S EXCELLENT
UM RIGHT LET US UM
WHAT'S ON THE NEXT ONE
OH RIGHT YES LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE UM
F FINANCE
UM NOW
WE'RE GIVEN A A CLEAR DESIGN BRIEF UH
IF I GET THE UH SPREADSHEET UP
OH
OH RIGHT
AH
GOOD THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO MAKE THESE THINGS SIMPLE SO THAT THE UH THE THE THE BOSS CAN UNDERSTAND
NOW I'VE UM THIS IS THE COMPANY'S UH UH COSTING FOR FOR VARIOUS UH UH ASPECTS OF DESIGN AND I I I'VE TREATED SOME OF THESE SLIGHTLY UH LIBERALLY GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS PLACED ON US
UM I WOULDN'T KNOW FOR IN FOR INSTANCE IF IF THEY REQUIRE US TO HAVE IT IN THE CORPORATE COLOURS
THEN THAT IS NOT A SPECIAL COLOUR THAT'S A THAT'S A STANDARD COLOUR
UH SO WE'RE JUST SIMPLY ON BATTERIES THE THE ONE TH THE ONE DECISION I'VE HAD TO MAKE IS THAT UM
WE'RE WE WILL HAVE TO FIND A S A REGULAR STANDARD CHIP TO TO DO THIS WITH AND I I UM I'M I'M I'M CERTAIN THAT THEY THEY ARE AROUND SO
UM THAT I DON'T THINK IS A A SERIOUS PROBLEM
THE UH THE THE VOICE SENSOR IS IS EXPENSIVE BUT WE WE MADE A A BASIC DECISION THAT THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL TO THE TO THE DESIGN SO THAT THAT HAS TO STAY
UM THEN AGAIN THE THE THE THE SHAPE OF THE CASE MEANS THAT IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE TO UH UM
L TO MAKE 'CAUSE OF THE THE TH THE DOUBLE CURVES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE OF OUR OVERALL FASHION CONCEPT UM WE WE SHOULD EXCEED THE THE SALES TARGETS
UM IT'S SIMPLY MADE OF PLASTIC SO TH THAT'S UH THAT'S NO PROBLEM AND UH UM JUST BECAUSE THE WHOLE THE COLOUR OF THE THE WHOLE THING THAT'S UH UH THERE'S SOME COST THERE
UM AND UH
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT A SCROLL WHEEL WE WE WE GOT PUSH BUTTONS AND AND A SIMPLE UH UM
SLIDER SO UM AND THE AND THE THE BUTTONS ARE UH UH WELL I DO DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE SPECIAL COLOUR
ANYWAY THE THE COSTINGS UH COME IN AT EXACTLY ON TARGET AT TWELVE POINT FIVE UH BUT I THI I THINK WE HAVE A A VERY STRONG CASE TO ARGUE THAT UH WHAT WHAT WE'VE GOT IS IS SO IN INNOVATIVE AND UH AND DIFFERENT THAT UM ANY ANY SLIGHT COMPROMISE WE HAVE TO MAKE ON ON COST IS IS OFFSET BY THE UH YOU KNOW THE
UH YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE CONCEPT OF IT BEING A A FASHION ACCESSORY AND AND HAVING THE THE INTERCHANGEABLE COVERS SO UH UM YOU KNOW THE IF IF IF THE MANAGEMENT EXPECT US TO BE TECHNO AGAIN FAIL AGAIN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE UM THAT THEY THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT WE WE CAN'T OPERATE ABSOLUTELY WITHIN UH THE CONSTRAINTS THAT THEY GIVE
SO UH WE WE WE PRESENT THIS AS THE UH THE COMPANY'S UH THE THE COMPANY'S WAY FORWARD AND UH UH I I THINK WE CAN ARGUE THAT WE WE HAVE UH COME IN ON ON BUDGET
UM
OKAY UH
SO UM
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO UH UH ANDREW DO YOU WANT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT UM
THE UH YEAH THE EVALUATION WHERE WHERE YOU KNOW WELL WHERE WHERE WE'RE WHERE WHERE WE'RE AT
THE THE THE WELL THE I MEANT THE PRODUCT
YEAH
OH SORRY YEAH UM MM
MM
MORE LOUD CLICKS IN THE MICROPHONE
SEVEN BEING A NICE ROUND NUMBER TO WORK TO
TR
ON FOR TRUE AND SEVEN FOR FLASE
YES
WELL I THINK MOST DEFINITELY
YES THE VOICE TECHNOLOGY INDEED
I DON'T SEE WE COULD'VE MADE IT ANY EASIER
TOTALLY
NO
YEAH
FOUND EASILY
YEAH I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S
YEAH
DOES IT TAKE LONG TO LEARN TO USE
SHOULDN'T
LESS BUTTONS SO IT MUST BE
SO YEAH UM UM
I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE I MEAN UH OLD OLDER PEOPLE WHO CAN'T MANAGE THE BUTTONS ANYWAY WILL ACTUALLY PROBABLY LIKE THE LIKE LIKE THE VOICE BIT SO
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S WELL I DON'T THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY
CHARGING A PARTICULAR PREMIUM ANYWAY IN THE END SO
YEAH
YEAH
IT WILL APPEAL F FOR DIF FOR DIFFERENT REASONS BUT IT'S IT'S UH YEAH YEAH SO I I YEAH I
YEAH SO I THINK WE CAN REASONABLY SAY IT'S ANOTHER ANOTHER ONE WHY NOT
IN IN IN IN MY INTERPRETATION OF MANAGEMENT'S INSTRUCTIONS UH IS THAT YES IT IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENT IS T IT'S TELEVISION ONLY IT'S IT'S SIMPLE TO USE
UM IT'S IT'S IT'S WITHIN BUDGET UM I IT'S UH YES AN AN ANY MINOR POINTS WE WE WE ARGUE
SO UH I I THINK WE'VE DONE AN AMAZING JOB IN UH
COMING UP WITH WHAT
NEED A NEED A CALCULATOR FOR THAT
OKAY NICK THE CABLE BACK THEN
OOH
RIGHT DO UM
EITHER OF YOU WANT TO UH SAY ANYTHING
MM
BEFORE I UH
NO
YEAH
YEAH
WELL THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN TH THIS THIS SLIDE HERE I MEAN THE SATISFACTION WITH UH ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
I MEAN I THINK WE'VE ALLOWED OURSELVES UH AS MUCH CREATIVITY AS THE UH THE THE THE PRODUCT UH ALLOWS
UM I WON'T COMMENT ON LEADERSHIP UH TEAMWORK I THINK WE'VE UH I THINK EVERYBODY'S UH WORKED PRETTY WELL TOGETHER
UM WE'VE JUST ABOUT COPED WITH THE WHITEBOARD AND DIGITAL PENS UH I THINK THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR ITSELF AND NEW IDEAS FOUND UM
AGAIN GI NO GIVEN RELATIVELY EVERYDAY PRODUCT I THINK WE'VE V VERY UH VERY EFFECTIVELY COME UP WITH A A NEW UH
UH A NEW APPROACH
UM ARE THE COSTS WITHIN BUDGET
YES
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
WE'RE WE'RE ALL HAPPY THAT IT IT MEETS ALL THE CRITERIA UM
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED I THINK THAT I THINK THAT'S UH I THINK WE CAN GO F FOR AN EARLY BATH
SO I CALL THE MEETING CLOSED

UH OKAY WE BASICALLY HAVE THE SAME KINDA LAY OUT HERE IT'S JUST UM YOU HOLD IT LIKE THIS AND IT GETS KINDA MOULDED TO THE TO THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND
BASICALLY
UM ON THE LEFT WE'VE GOT THE SCROLL FOR THE VOLUME
ON THE RIGHT WE HAVE BUTTONS FOR THE CHANNELS UP AND DOWN AND THAT KINDA SO YOU CAN HOLD IT AND SCROLL
OR YOU CAN HOLD IT AND AND PUSH
UH THIS IS THE POWER KEY UM IT'S KINDA LIKE THE BIGGEST SO YOU KNOW HOW TO TURN ON
UH THAT'S THE LITTLE MENU KEY
THIS IS THE INFRA RED SECTION SO YOU G IT'LL BE SENDING RAYS AND IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW POINTING IT LIKE THAT IT CAN SEND IT
OR IF YOU HOLD IT UP LIKE THAT IT'LL SEND IT
UH WE GOT A MICROPHONE THERE WHICH FOR ALL THE VOICE COMMANDS SO YOU CAN YOU KNOW TALK TO IT LIKE THAT AND IT'LL STILL UNDERSTAND
UM THE LOGO IS DOWN DOWN THERE UM AND HAS THE COVER ON IT AND YOU CAN SEE LIKE IT JUST KINDA GOES THE RED BIT'S THE COVER AND IT KINDA GOES OVER EVERYTHING AND THEN THERE'S HOLES FOR THE BUTTONS TO COME THROUGH
UM
MM
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT IT'S ALSO E E EASIER TO PUT ON VERSUS LIKE MOBILE COVERS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SCREW THEM ON AND STUFF AND YOU KINDA SOMETIMES HAVE TO GET SOMEONE TO DO THAT FOR YOU
THIS IS VERY MUCH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO STRETCH IT OVER YOURSELF AND IT'LL BE FINE
YEAH
YEAH
LI THAT'LL BE THE COVERS AS WELL YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT COULD STAND YEAH
WELL WE COULD BROADEN THE BROADEN IT OUT A BIT SO IT WOULD STAND LIKE THAT
YEAH STANDING
YEAH WE COULD JUST WIDEN IT OUT UH
MM
MM
MM YEAH YEAH
HAVE TO IF WE JUST LENGTHEN IT I GUESS SO IT COMES DOWN TO THE BASE OF THE HAND AND THEN FLATTEN IT OUT AND COULD SIT THERE
YEAH MM
YEAH
YEAH
WE MIGHT HAVE TO LENGTHEN IT SO IT KINDA YOUR HAND STILL HOLDS IT AND HAVE IT THERE YEAH YEAH YEAH LIKE THAT LIKE THAT
YEAH
MM
THE FINAL PRODUCT WOULD ACTUALLY STAND UP YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WEE
MM

YEAH I'D SAY DEFINITELY A ONE YEAH
YEAH DEFI YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH
YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH MM-HMM
NO NOT AT ALL
UH
YEAH IT IS SORTA THE THE HANDLE MORE ERGONOMICALLY CORRECT AS WELL
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
I I I THINK IT WILL TEND TO APPEAL MORE TO YOUNGER AGED GROUPS JUST 'CAUSE WE HAVE GONE WITH THE FASHION FOCUS AND THE YOUNGER PEOPLE TEND TO WOULD BE MORE CONSCIOUS OF THAT ASPECT OF IT
BUT UM I THINK IT SHOULD STILL APPEAL ON A CERTAIN LEVEL TO EVERYBODY YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM

MM
YEP
YEP
COOL THANK YOU
MM
S
AND SO WE FIGURED IT WOULD BE KIND OF YOU KNOW A LIGHT WEIGHT PLASTIC
JUST KIND OF A LIGHT NON DESCRIPT GREY SO THAT PEOPLE'LL WANNA BUY THE COVERS AND THEN THE COVERS WILL BE THAT SORT OF RUBBERY MATERIAL LIKE THEY MAKE IPOD COVERS
SO THEY KINDA JUST STRETCH OVER
YEAH
WELL I I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BUT YEAH THEY'RE KIND OF IT'S JUST KIND OF A RUBBERY AND THAT WAY YOU KNOW SPONGY LIKE IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WANTED AND IT JUST SORT OF STRETCHES OVER AND THAT WAY I THINK PROBABLY HELPS PROTECT IT A LITTLE BIT TOO AS WELL AND
JUST KINDA STRETCH IT OVER
AND IT'LL JUST STAY ON AND THEN THE BUTTONS COME THROUGH AND SO AND THEN THE EACH ONE OF 'EM ON THE VERY END WILL HAVE THE LOGO WITH THE YELLOW CIRCLE AND THE R. R.
YEAH
LIKE THAT
OH
YEAH
YEAH JUST KIND OF
OR JUST MAKE IT LITTLE
SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT
SO IT JUST SORT OF
YEAH
BU
FALL OVER
YEAH
YEAH
'S A LITTLE LONGER
YEAH
I THINK IT IS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT MADE WE MET ALL OF THE CONSUMER
WANTS
NO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK SO
YEAH
YEAH I THINK JUST THE SIMPLICITY OF IT AND
NOT HAVING TO LEARN TO PROGRAMME AND NOT HAVING YOU KNOW A MILLION BUTTONS
UNDER THE COST
YEAH
I MIXED UP THE COLOURS A LITTLE BIT
I THINK I ALL WRONG
MM
PS I DON'T THINK SO
I MEAN I THINK WE WORKED WELL TOGETHER AND LOOKED REALLY AT WHAT THE CONSUMERS WANTED AND WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE AND YOU KNOW
SEEMED TO DISCUSS THINGS PRETTY WELL AND COME TO GROUP CONSENSUS AND
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH
OKAY
COULD HAVE ONE FOR YOUR STEREO ONE FOR YOUR D. V. PLAYER
YEAH I KINDA HAD A
A KINDA A NATURAL KIND OF A IDEA WHERE IT'S LIKE MORE OF A KIND OF LIKE A KINDA MAYBE SLIGHTLY LIKE THINNER
YEAH KINDA LIKE THAT KINDA LIKE A FLOWER OR A PLANT FOR THE MORE NATURAL KINDA
UH YEAH JUST CLICK THERE
UH THE
THE MAXIMISE BUTTON
EVALUATION
THE THE PRODUCT OR THE PROJECT
UM WELL WELL MY PRESENTATION JUST NOW
SURE UH CAN I GET THE
CHEERS
THERE WE GO OH
METHOD OF EVALUATION TESTING THE PRODUCT WAS TO JUST IF IT MET ALL THE CRITERIA ALL THE CONDITIONS THAT WE SET OUT TO
SET OUT TO SOLVE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE THE CONSUMER AND THE MANAGEMENT
SO
WHAT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO IS ON THE WHITEBOARD
UM GAUGE
OUR TEAM RESPONSE TO THESE QUESTIONS
SO ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN ONE BEING TRUE AND SEVEN BEING BEING FALSE
YEAH
AND THEN AT THE END JUST TAKE AN AVERAGE
YES
SO UH
SO LOOK AT THESE QUESTIONS
IS THE DEVICE F FLASHY AND FASHIONABLE
SO UH AND ALSO UH TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
EASY TO USE
UH SUITABLE FOR THE CONSUMER
THAT WAS UM
YEAH
UH IS IT COMPLICATED
DOING PRETTY WELL SO FAR AREN'T WE
UH FUNCTIONAL
UM
WHERE ARE WE
WE'VE B BUILT IN THE THE SPEECH WHERE ARE YOU FUNCTION
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
AND UH WHAT ELSE
THE R. S. I. COMPARES TO THE CURRENT STANDARDS WELL
WE WE UH YEAH IT WAS OUR IT WAS A WE MADE AN ACTUAL EFFORT TO
UM WILL DEVICE APPEAL TO ALL AGE GROUPS
YEAH UH THAT'S A GOOD CALL YEAH
WELL WE HAD THE WE HAD THE DATA SAYING THAT OLD PEOPLE WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO PAY EXTRA MONEY BUT THE FUNCT THE INCREASED FUNCTIONALITY
THE E EASE OF USE OF THE DEVICE MIGHT MAKE UP FOR THAT
MM
UH CAN YOU JUST CLICK THE MY MOUSE TO MOVE ONTO NEXT PAGE
UH YEAH AND WHAT H DID WE MAKE THE MANAGEMENT'S
UM
OKAY
SO UH ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN
ELEVEN DIVIDED BY ELEVEN'S ONE SO EQUALS AVERAGE OF ONE
AND THAT ROUGHLY CONCLUDES MY EVALUATION OF THE OF THE PRODUCT
UH YEAH
FINE NOW
OH IT'S NOT LIKING US IT WENT THAT A WAY
COMPUTER ADJUSTING
OH
UH
OKAY
SO
RIGHT
YOU READY BACK THERE
UH OKAY
WELCOME EVERYONE
UM THIS IS THE KICK OFF MEETING FOR THE DAY
UM WE'RE THE NEW GROUP UH TO CREATE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR REAL REACTION
AS YOU CAN SEE OUR AGENDA IS TO OPEN UP THE MEETING UM BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER
UM HAVE A LITTLE TRAINING ON TOOLS UH CREATE A PLAN DISCUSS THINGS AND AND WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY MINUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TOTAL
OKAY
THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL IS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
THAT STEPH IS YOUR PART IS THE USER FRIENDLINESS
THE ORIGINALITY UM IS GONNA TAKE ALL OF US
UM THE TRENDINESS WE'LL PROBABLY GO LOOK AT FOR SOME MARKETING RESEARCH INFORMATION FROM YOU SARAH
UM AND WE'LL GET ON WITH IT
OKAY SO WE'LL HAVE A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN INDIVIDUAL WORK UM WITH MEETING AND THEN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN T AND THEN DETAILED DESIGN
OKAY
RIGHT
EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED TO TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD
KATE WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT FIRST IF YOU CAN EITHER BRING YOUR THINGS WITH YOU I GUESS
AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT WE'LL TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOOK THESE THINGS ON AS WELL 'CAUSE WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND
UH I DO NOT THINK SO I THINK IT'S JUST TO TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD
AH
UH-HUH
OKAY
GREAT
AND THE CHARACTERISTICS
UH-HUH
OKAY
FANTASTIC
SINCE YOU'RE HANDY AS WELL WHY DON'T YOU DO YOURS NEXT STEPH
I THINK IT'S TO GET US USED TO USING THE PEN
UH NO
A MOUSE Y
OH
ARGH
RAT
NOT A MOUSE A RAT
AND YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
OH
OKAY
KATE
OH A FISH
OH OKAY
FINE
FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS
'KAY
SO THEY HAVE TEAM ELEMENTS
I'M AFRAID I'M WITH STEPH
AND I THINK YOUR PEN'S RUNNING OUT OF WHATEVER
BUT I'M AFRAID I TAKE THE COWARD'S WAY OUT AND THE CAT'S LOOKING THE OTHER WAY
HE'S HIDING
UM CATS ARE SOMETIMES VERY INDEPENDENT
MY PARENTS HAD CATS
UH AND THEY CAN MM DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT IS BEST
OKAY
NOW UM WE HAVE TO GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY OF HOW TO MAKE THIS AND THIS REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE SOLD UM WE'RE TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS
WITH A PROFIT AIM ULTIMATELY OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS
THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT HOW MANY UM WE HAVE TO SELL ON AN INTERNATIONAL SCALE
UM WOULD BE AN AWFUL LOT OF THESE WOULD BE LIKE WHAT
A HUNDRED MILLION OF THEM UM TO MAKE TWENTY FIVE EUROS ON EACH ONE AND TO MAKE A TOTAL PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION
UM THE PRODUCTION IS TO ONLY COST TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS PER ITEM
NOW IF THEY COST TWELVE AND A HALF YOU'RE SELLING IT FOR TWENTY FIVE YOU'RE MAKING TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS EACH
UM AND WE'RE TO MAKE A PROFIT OF FIFTY MILLION THAT'S T UH CAN YOU DO THE MATHS AND HOW MANY ARE WE SELLING
MARK UP
OKAY
YES 'CAUSE OUR MARKET UM IS INTERNATIONAL AND YOUR PROBLEM IS HAS TO DO WITH MARKETING OF YOU KNOW
YOU GOTTA KNOW HOW MANY WE'RE GOING TO BE SELLING TO KNOW HOW BIG A MARKET YOU HAVE TO TARGET AND WHO IS THAT
TO GIVE YOU A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY
THAT'S FIFTY MILLION EUROS
IN ORDER TO MAKE FIFTY MILLION EUROS AND YOU'RE ONLY GETTING TWELVE AND A HALF EACH
THAT'S A LOT OF SELLING
TWO FOUR
TO BE FIFTY BE FOUR MILLION
YOU'D HAVE TO SELL FOUR MILLION
OKAY
RIGHT
EXPERIENCE WITH A REMOTE CONTROL
ANY OF YOU USE OF REMOTE CONTROL FOR A TELEVISION OR D. V. D. OR SOMETHING
YOU'RE BOTH NODDING ALL THREE
WELL
I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE FOR MORE THAN ONE DEVICE AT A TIME
BUT I ALSO HAVE HEARD ABOUT THEM NOT WORKING WELL OR NOT WELL CO ORDINATED AND YOU WIND UP WORKING WITH THIS ONE FOR THI THIS THREE AND THEN THIS ONE OVER HERE FOR ANOTHER
AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS TALK TO EACH OTHER
DON'T KNOW
OKAY
ARE THERE ANY UM IDEAS FOR THE REMOTE
WHAT WOULD IT BE FOR AND WHAT GROUP WOULD BE BE FOR
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT ONE
OKAY
MM
OKAY
YEAH
UM I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS VERY QUICK BUT THE
I THINK THAT'S THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS THE FIRST ONE THAT'S KATE FOR THE WORKING DESIGN
AND USER THAT'S YOU S STEPH FOR THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN AND FOR MARKETING THE USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION
I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WE HAVE TO HELP EACH OTHER AND WORK THROUGH THIS AS A GROUP
AND I THINK WE ALL YOU KNOW
WE LIKE OUR KITTY CAT AND OUR RAT AND OUR FISH BUT I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO LIKE EACH OTHER UM TO GET THIS DONE
UH AS IT SAYS WE'RE GONNA GET INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTIONS BUT UH I DON'T THINK THEY ALLOWED A LOT OF EXTRA TIME
SO I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF LESS OF THIS AND MORE AT DO WILL SET US IN GOOD STEAD
DO YOU ALL AGREE
ALRIGHT
UM THEN I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO PROLONG IT AND F WE SHOULD FINISH THIS MEETING AT NI RIGHT NOW AND GO INTO OTHER THINGS
ALRIGHT SO THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST MEETING
THANK YOU ALL
UH YEAH IF I CAN PICK UP WITH ALL THESE BITS AND PIECES HANG ON
UH RIGHT SO YOU WANT AN ANIMAL AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
DO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE WHAT ANIMAL IT IS
UM
ONLY ANIMAL I COULD THIN I COULD DRAW
ITS A SORT OF BUNNY RABBIT CAT
YOU CAN TELL IT'S NOT A BUNNY RABBIT BY THE EARS
UM I SUPPOSE IT SHOULD HAVE A MOUTH AS WELL SORT OF
RIGHT YEAH
UM THE FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CAT UM THE WHISKERS I THINK UM BECAUSE THEY'RE THE EASIEST TO DRAW
IN FACT I'LL GIVE IT SOME MORE
OH AND THE TAIL
YES
UM SURE IT'S NOT TO TEST OUR ARTISTIC
IT'S A MOUSE
NO IT'S NOT A MOUSE
IT'S A WOMBAT
A WHAT
A WEBBED FOOT
WEBBED F OH RIGHT
GOSH WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF FISH
THAT'S EVEN EASIER TO DRAW THAN CAT
THAT THAT THAT'S THE SORTA PRODUCT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE THAT WILL WORK FOR A IN A HOME ENVIRONMENT FOR A T. V. S AND
I THINK ONE THAT WORKS WOULD BE GOOD
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
'KAY
ARE WE ALL GONNA DRAW A CAT
THAT'S NOT A MOUSE Y NO
IT'S A RATTY
A RATTY
IT'S CLOTHES
THAT'S IT'S CLOTHES
IT'S A RATTY WITH A WITH A WITH A VERY LONG TAIL
I LOVE WHISKERS
UH THEY'RE INTELLIGENT AND THEY'RE CHEEKY AND
UH FANTASTIC PETS AND VERY FRIENDLY
AND THEY SIT ON YOUR SHOULDER AND WHISPER THE ANSWERS TO YOUR HOMEWORK IN YOUR EAR WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR HOMEWORK
A SHARK
IT IS TRUE THAT YOU ALWAYS SIT AROUND YOU KNOW YOU'RE SITTING ON YOUR SOFA AND YOU WANNA CHANGE SOMETHING THERE'S FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTES
AND ONE FOR THE D. V. D. AND ONE FOR THE VIDEO AND ONE FOR CABLE AND ONE FOR WHATEVER ELSE
BUT I PRESUME THIS IS T I PRESUME THIS IS JUST FOR TELEVISION
I THINK ONE IN B BRIGHT COLOURS WOULD BE GOOD
I THINK ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE LOTS OF SUPERFLUOUS FUNCTIONS
LIKE I'VE GOT ONE AT HOME THAT HAS
WELL APART FROM THE OBVIOUS CHANNELS CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN VOLUME
YOU KNOW SUBTITLES MUTE THERE'S A LOTTA BUTTONS THAT I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT THEY DO LIKE
MM
OOH CLOSING THE MEETING
THAT WAS QUICK
MM-HMM
IS THIS OKAY
I KNOW
THANKS
MM THIS IS VERY REPRESENTATIONAL FISH
UM I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SLEEK AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF FREEDOM BUT THEY ALSO DO N UH SWIM IN GROUPS SO
DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE ONE
UH YEAH
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THAT'S THE UM
IF FIFTY PERCENT IS NORMAL
B YEAH
UM I WOULD THINK WOULD BE MORE LIKE SIXTY PERCENT
BUT UM LET ME I HAVE TWO THOUGHTS
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT
AND AND YOUR QUESTION IS HOW MANY DO WE HAVE TO SELL
AT TWENTY FIVE
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S UM
SO THAT'S FOUR MILLION OF THEM
YEAH
AND IF WE MAKE
MM-HMM
YEAH
FOUR MILLION
HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
Y YEAH
WE COULD MAKE A HELLO KITTY
THEMED REMOTE
YEAH
WE COULD TOTALLY GO FOR THE JAPAN A MATION
WELL I MEAN THERE'S ALSO THE CACHET THAT UM UH THE JAPANESE MAKE GREAT PRODUCTS
ELECTRICAL THEIR INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS VERY GOOD
YEAH
WELL THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BEING SOMEWHAT COMPUTER LITERATE
WE TEND TO UM GO TO MENUS AND THEN MAKE CHOICES YOU KNOW
SO IF IT'S LIKE AN UH VOLUME BUTTON YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO IN AND SAY MUTE OR OR VOLUME
WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE LIKE THE L THE NUMBERS IF WE ALSO HAVE UH UH CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN
MM
WE CAN MAKE IT SMART LIKE AN IPOD YOU KNOW MAKE EVERYTHING MENUS
OKAY
UH IT FELL OFF
ONE TWO THREE FOUR YEAH WE'RE READY
OKAY
WELCOME TO THIS SECOND MEETING
UM IT'S NOW QUARTER AFTER TWELVE AND WE'RE GIVEN FORTY MINUTES UM FOR THIS MEETING
THIS IS A MEETING ON FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
UM AND I WANNA WELCOME YOU ALL AND THANK YOU ALL FOR DOING SOME RESEARCH IN BETWEEN
UM I DID TOOK THE MINUTES FROM THE FIRST MEETING AND I'LL SHOW THEM TO YOU IN A MOMENT
UM I KNOW EACH OF YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION AND UM IN THINKING ABOUT THE FORTY MINUTES
I THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE ONLY LIKE THREE MINUTES FOR THE PREVIOUS MINUTES UM EACH OF YOU HAVING ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES OR MAYBE A LITTLE MORE
MAYBE A LITTLE LESS FOR YOUR PRE PRESENTATIONS AND A LITTLE DISCUSSION
BECAUSE THERE'S I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE WERE SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME UH DECISION ON WHAT FUNCTIONS IT WILL HAVE
OKAY
IS THIS AP EVERYBODY AGREE WITH THIS
OKAY
UM AND AFTER THE MEETING THERE'LL BE THINGS TO BE DONE AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT SAYS WE GET TO GET LUNCH
UM AND THEN SOME MORE INDIVIDUAL WORK AND THEN PUTTING MINUTES AWAY AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
UM BUT UH NOW FOR THE MINUTES OF THE FIRST MEETING
AND GO TO THAT ONE
UM AS YOU CAN SEE IT WAS THIS EARLIER TODAY
UM KATE STEPH SARAH AND MYSELF IN OUR FOUR CAPACITIES WERE PRESENT
I OPENED THE MEETING THE PRODUCT WAS DEVELOPED UH AND REVIEWED AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL END OF IT
UM AND IT HAD SOME IMPLICATIONS UM THE FOUR MILLION SALES TARGET AND NEW IDEAS OF NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS
BRIGHT COLOURS AND SOME OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE JAPANESE
AND WE CLOSED EARLY SO YOU COULD THEN PROCEED WITH YOUR RESEARCH AND GETTING YOUR REPORTS TOGETHER FOR TOD THIS MEETING
ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THOSE MINUTES
ARE THEY COMPLETE DID THEY DISCUSS EVERYTHING THAT WE COVERED LAST TIME
'KAY
DID I MISS SOMETHING
YEAH
I'M AFRAID I INCORPORATED THAT WHEN I SAID WHO WAS PRESENT BUT YES WE DID
AND WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF UH TEAM BUILDING OF UH OF MAKING THE PICTURES BUT I DIDN'T THINK THOSE WERE APPROPRIATE TO THE MINUTES NECESSARILY
SO UM AS A GROUP I THINK WE'VE ARE THEY'RE ACCEPTING THE MINUTES
AND UH OKAY
YEAH
GOOD
UM THEN WE'LL MOVE TO THE THREE PRESENTATIONS
OKAY
OKAY
MM WE NEED TO MOVE THIS
WHO WANTS TO GO F FIRST
THAT'S AS FAR AS IT GOES
SHE SAID WE DIDN'T NEED TO SCREW IT IN
IT'S DOING ITS THING
THERE WE ARE
NOW IN BETWEEN AS THE PROJECT MANAGER
THEY SENT ME AN EMAIL FROM THE POWERS THAT BE UM THAT TELETEXT IS OUTDATED UM AND THE INTERNET IS COMING IN AS IMPORTANT
BUT THAT THEY WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL TO ONLY BE FOR T. V. UM WITH INCORPORATING THE CORPORATE IMAGE COLOUR AND SLOGAN
MM
HMM
OKAY
MM
IS THAT A LARGE ENOUGH TARGET MARKET TO TARGET IT
IN REAL NUMBERS DOES THE NINETY ONE PERCENT AND THE SEVENTY SIX PERCENT TRANSLATE TO EX IN EXCESS OF THE FOUR MILLION
OR EIGHT MILLION
HMM
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT WHETHER THEY'RE EARLY ADOPTERS ON THAT SCREEN THAT'S LOOKING AT AGE GROUPS
LEAP
HMM
MM
OKAY YOU HAD THE OTHER POWER CHANNEL
OKAY
ALRIGHT
AND WE'LL TURN TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION
I THINK SHE SAID WE DON'T NEED TO SCREW IT IN JUST STICK IT IN
AND THEN PRESS WHAT
F F. N. AND F. EIGHT
NEXT TO THE CONTROL BUTTON ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN F. EIGHT AT THE TOP
AND THEN W BE PATIENT
TADA
THERE WE ARE
YAY
OKAY
T. V. ONLY
UGH
HMM
MM
AND EXCEED THE REQUIREMENTS THEY'RE EXPECTING OF US
OKAY
ALRIGHT
OKAY
ANY UH THING ELSE YOU WANNA ADD
OKAY
YEAH
LET'S HEAR WHAT KATE HAS TO SAY
HMM
I THINK THE WHITE THAT ONE ON THE RIGHT IS AS WELL AS LESS CLUTTERED
IT'S THERE BUT IT'S
YEAH
HMM
OKAY
HMM MM
HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
BUT THOSE THINGS AS LONG AS WE CAN GET THOSE COMPONENTS
THE BLOCK THAT THAT RECTANGLE FOR THE USER INTERFACE IS WHERE THE USER COMES IN OF WHAT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
WHAT DO THE BUTTONS LOOK LIKE
UH WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE
THAT'S WHERE THE USER INTERFACE IS REALLY COMING INTO ITS OWN
THE TECHNICAL END IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE IN THERE BUT ALSO IT HAS TO BE EASY ENOUGH TO CHANGE OR REPAIR IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
FOR EXAMPLE THE BATTERY ENERGY SOURCE OR UM WHAT IF THE CHIP
FOR WHATEVER REASON BREAKS DOWN AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME DO YOU JUST REPLACE IT
UM IS THERE ANY UM BECAUSE IT MAY BE IN THE SAME AREA WITH SEVERAL OTHER USER INTERFACES LIKE FOR D. V. D. S MOVIES WHATEVER
UM DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE A
A WAY OF BEING SEGREGATED FROM THE OTHERS IN A DIFFERENT FREQUENCY OR SOMETHING
MM
OKAY
OKAY
OH
MM
WHAT THEY COST
OKAY
MM
MM
MM
OKAY
UH YEAH
MM
IT WOULD HAVE TO SOR STORE UP THE ENERGY
AND THEN USE IT
SOLAR CAN DO THAT
M YEAH THAT WOULD BE TOO HEAVY AND IT'D COST TOO MUCH
MM
MM
YEAH
AND THE DOCK COULD LOOK VERY FANCY AND THAT COULD BE YOUR INSPIRATION OF HAVING IT LOOKING DECENT
HMM
YEAH
OKAY
ARE WE AGREED AS TO WHAT OUR TARGET GROUP IS THOUGH
PRETTY MUCH SO THAT WE'D BE LOOKING FOR THE YOUNGER END
MM
I I S USUALLY PUT MORE MONEY THAN BRAINS
MM
YEAH
OR DO WE S MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES TO THE MAN THROUGH THE MANUFACTURER
WE SELL TO THE MANUFACTURER AS THE REMOTE THAT GOES WITH IT
WHAT WOULD BE A MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING IT
MM-HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
PROBABLY NOT
UM THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IS MAKE DECISION ON OUR FUNCTIONS
OUR FUNCTIONS WE'VE SO FAR DECIDED I THINK THAT POWER CHANNEL VOLUME MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE
UM IT HAS TO HAVE AN ENTER KEY AND OF COURSE THE NUMBER KEYS
IT HAS TO HAVE BIG USER FRIENDLY BUTTONS AND SH N DEFINITELY WE WANNA BE INSPIRED THAT THE CURRENT
STYLES ARE JUST PLAIN AWFUL
IS THAT AGREEABLE TO EVERYONE
MM-HMM
THROW SOME LIGHT ON THAT
UM ACTUALLY WE'RE YOU KNOW WE ARE ALMOST A HALF HOUR OUT OF THE FORTY MINUTES SO WE HAVE TO GET CLOSE TO FINISHING
AH
MM-HMM
OKAY
ENTER POWER AS A S OH UM A SUM SIMULTANEOUS KEY
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU
WOULD THAT UH-HUH
THEN YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE AN OFF TE OFF KEY
MM
MM
OKAY
MM
OKAY
SO I GUESS EASY TO USE IS THE OTHER THING THAT WE WANT 'EM TO BE ABLE TO DO
AS YOU SAID YOU KNOW DON'T MAKE IT TOO HARD FOR THE GRANNY
I JUST JOINED THAT SET LAST WEEK
UM FIRST GRANDCHILD ARRIVED
UM SO ARE WE AGREED THEN OF THOSE THINGS
AND LET'S GO BACK TO AGENDA AND HOOK ME UP
MM
THIS OUGHTA BE FUN
IT PROBABLY WON'T GO THE FIRST TIME IT'LL PROBABLY BE LIKE A G MESS
COME ON
UH IT LOST IT OFF HERE
UH
NO IT WAS UP THERE BUT I COULDN'T SEE IT DOWN HERE
MM
THIS TIME IT SHOULD BE BOTH
THERE WE GO
UM YOU HAVE TO KEEP DOING THE FINANCI THE THE F. N. AND F. EIGHT TO FIVE MINUTES TO FINISH THANK YOU A LOT FOR TELLING ME
UM RIGHT WE'RE READY TO CLOSE
UM WILL BE COMPLETED Q QUESTIONNAIRE UM THEN WE'LL HAVE SOME TIME FOR INDIVIDUAL WORK TO CONTINUE OUR RESEARCH UM AND I'LL PUT SOME MINUTES OF THIS MEETING TOGETHER
UM YOUR INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENTS ARE FOR
UM KATE TO DO THE COMPONENTS FOR
YOU STEPH TO DO THE USER INTERFACE AND FOR YOU THE TREND WATCHING
UM AND EACH OF US WILL GET HELP FROM OUR COACH
ARE WE AGREED TO GET OURSELVES TOGETHER AND THEN HAVE LUNCH
OKAY
THEN THAT'S THE END OF THIS MEETING
AND I HOPE THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER TO TELL HER THAT'S THE END
OKAY
WELL I THINK I WENT OVER THE FUNCTIONS AND WROTE THEM DOWN AND MARKED THEM
UM THAT'S WHAT I WENT OVER AND NOBODY WAS OBJECTING TO THEM
OKAY
UM THE TELETEXT IS OUTDATED THE INTERNET IS IMPORTANT
IT'S ONLY TO BE FOR A T. V. AND IT MUST INCLUDE THE CORPORATE IMAGE
COLOUR AND SLOGAN UM WHICH I THINK IS MORE IN THE USER UH RANGE WITH STEPH
IT DOESN'T TELL ME
MM-HMM
OKAY
OOPS
UH I THINK SO WE WE WE TALKED ABOUT THE THE INDIVIDUAL ROLES THAT WE EACH HAD AS WELL
OKAY
OY BIG LOOP UNDER THE TABLE
COULD CAN I ASK WHERE THESE FIGURES COME FROM IS THIS MARKET RESEARCH WE'VE
MM-HMM
UM
HOW D I'M WONDERING HOW HOW OU HOW OUR TARGET PRICE COMPARES WITH THE THE TYPICAL PRICE OF THESE THINGS
I EXPECT AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD KNOW THAT
BUT IF WE'RE AIMING TO TO BUILD THIS THING FOR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY UM IS THAT A LOT OR A LITTLE
SH SURELY HE'S IN THE WRONG AGE GROUP
HE MUST BE W ONE OF A S SMALL POPULATION
AND IF YOU WANT IT TO GO INTO SLIDE SHOW MODE IT'S THAT LITTLE BUTTON THERE
I YOU CAN IF YOU LIKE IT IT THAT THAT JUST SETS IT UP TO DO A P A P NO THAT ONE THAT ONE THERE
LEFT LEFT A BIT LEFT A BIT THAT ONE YEP
AND THEN YOU JUST PRESS THE CLICK WHEN YOU WANNA GO ON
CHEERS
MM I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT A DISPLAY ON MY SCREEN
STILL I'LL DO WITHOUT THAT
OKAY UM NOW I WANNA BRING US DOWN TO EARTH AGAIN I'M AFRAID AND TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL PRACTICALITIES OF HOW THE THING NEEDS TO WORK
UM OH AND THIS IS THE METHODOLOGY I USED IN PREPARING FOR THIS MEETING
UM BASICALLY I'VE BEEN DOING A LITTLE BIT OF WEB BASED RESEARCH AND IF I HAD A DESIGN TEAM I WOULD'VE BEEN DISCUSSING MY IDEAS WITH 'EM
BUT THE THE NET RESULT IS THAT I'VE COME UP WITH A FIRST CUT FOR THE WORKING DESIGN THAT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU
SO LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT THE BASIC FUNCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL IS
IT'S FOR SENDING A MESSAGE UM TYPICALLY UM VIA INFRARED
AND THE THE BASIC COMPONENTS WE'VE GOT TO BUILD IN FOR OUR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY ARE UM AN ENERGY SOURCE THE USER INTERFACE AND
WHICH WILL UM IN INCORPORATE UM AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT THAT ACTUALLY COMPOSES THE MESSAGE UM BASED ON WHAT THE WHICH BUTTONS THE USER PRESSES
WE TURN THAT INTO A MESSAGE UM AND THEN WE NEED A SENDING MECHANISM TO SEND IT TO THE RECEIVER
NOW I WOULD HAVE HOPED I THINK THAT'S MY ONLY SLIDE ACTUALLY YEAH
I WOULD HAVE HAVE HOPED TO UM
DO YOU A PRETTY POWERPOINT SLIDE OF UM MY FIRST CUT DESIGN
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE TECHNOLOGY DEFEATED ME SO IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME I'LL DO IT ON THE WHITEBOARD
SO WE WANT AN ENERGY SOURCE
WHICH IS THERE
AND WE'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT BE
UH WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT WIRES ON THIS THING
UH TYPICALLY IT WOULD BE A BATTERY BUT I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS
UM AND
THEN WE HAVE THE THE USER INTERFACE
OOPS
AND THE MAIN COMPONENTS IN THERE ARE THE
THE TH THE CHIP THAT ACTUALLY HAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE MACHINE THAT TRANSLATES BUTTON PRESSES INTO A MESSAGE WHICH IT THEN
TRANSFERS TO SOME SENDING MECHANISM WHICH ENCODES IT
AND SENDS THE MESSAGE TO THE RECEIVER
SO THOSE ARE THE BASIC THINGS THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET IN FOR OUR TWELVE EUROS FIFTY
THANK YOU
MM-HMM
WELL I MAY BE WRONG HERE BUT I'D BEEN THINKING OF THIS DEVICE AS BEING A A CHEAP MASS PRODUCED DEVICE
WE'RE TRYING TO SELL FOUR MILLION OF 'EM UM THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ALMOST ONE IN EVERY TENTH HOUSEHOLD OR WHATEVER IT IS
UM AND I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT AS BEING A REPARABLE THING
YOU JUST IF IT GOES WRONG YOU CHUCK IT OUT AND THAT'S WHY I'M A BIT CONCERNED
I LIKE THE IDEA OF SPEECH RECOGNITION THAT'S A GREAT IDEA
BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED WE CAN PUT IT INTO THIS BOX FOR THE PRICE THAT WE NEED GONNA NEED TO HIT
UM
I'M I'M I'M HOPING THAT MY PERSONAL COACH IS GONNA GIVE ME SOME ADVICE ON THAT IF YOU'RE ASKING ME BUT
YEAH
WELL I UH THINK THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING IDEA BUT UM I'M NOT A VERY GOOD INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT THESE THINGS COST
I'LL DO SOME RESEARCH FOR THE NEXT MEETING
WELL SOLAR MAY NOT BE SO GOOD WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. IN THE NIGHT BUT
YEAH I GUESS
WE MAY BE TALKING QUITE HEAVY THEN
MM-HMM
SO DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT MAKE THAT A SELLING POINT IF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND WE COULD AFFORD TO DEVELOP
MM
YEAH I WAS WONDERING THAT BECAUSE I AG I AGREE THAT THERE THERE'RE PEOPLE WITH UH HOW CAN I PUT IT
MORE MONEY THAN SENSE AND WHO ARE LIABLE TO BUY SOMETHING NEW BUT
BU BUT WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY WAS
ALTHOUGH THEY THEY MAY BE BUYING UM YOU KNOW PERSONAL MUSIC DEVICES AND ALL THAT ARE THEY NECESSARILY BUYING T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS
BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY LIVE IN A HOUSEHOLD THAT HAS A T. V. IF THEY'RE AT THE LOWER END OF THE AGE RANGE I DON'T KNOW
MM
I THINK WE'VE GOT A BIG HILL TO CLIMB HERE HAVEN'T WE
I MEAN WE'VE GOTTA PERSUADE PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT A REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT CAME WITH THE TELLY THAT THEY SHOULD BUY OUR PRODUCT INSTEAD
RIGHT GOOD POINT
YEAH YEAH OKAY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH GOOD POINT
MM-HMM
DO YOU WANT THE GIZMO
H HOW DOES THAT WORK
HOW SO SO HOW DOES THAT WORK HOW DO YOU AVOID SWITCHING THE THING OFF WHEN YOU ACTUALLY WANNA PRESS ENTER
OKAY YEP MM-HMM
IT'S NOT GETTING A BIT COMPLICATED
COULD GRANNY DO THIS OR ARE WE JUST NOT AIMING AT GRANNY
MM
UH
HOW DO YOU DO THAT
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT DO BOTH
AH OKAY IT TOGGLES THROUGH YEAH
YEAH
SOUNDS GOOD
OKAY
SO WE'RE STILL IN MEETING AREN'T WE
OKAY
YES
YEAH I DO
UH NOT REALLY MEANT TO TOUCH THOSE MICROPHONES
OH IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ON DOES IT
THAT'S FINE
UH IT DEFINITELY NEEDS UH A LOT MORE RESEARCH ON LIKE HOW MUCH MORE IT WOULD BE AND ANY
YOU KNOW EXISTING EXAMPLES AND WHAT REACTIONS TO THEM HAVE BEEN AND THAT SORT OF THING
YEAH PRESS THEM
YEAH HERE WE GO
CAN I NOT JUST UH
DO EACH ONE IN ORDER
THAT
THAT
THAT
RIGHT TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
UH WELL I THINK FIRST OFF BASICALLY I DO AGREE WITH WHAT SARAH HAS DEFINED AS AS UH YOUR PERSONAL
I THINK WE NEED UH A MORE STREAMLINED VOLUME WITH NO EXTRANEOUS FUNCTIONS
SO MY METHOD WAS TO LOOK AT THE EXISTING REMOTES AND WHAT FUNCTIONS THEY HAVE
AND WHAT WE ALL NEED TO DISCUSS IS WHETHER WE WANT THESE FUNCTIONS
UH PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS WHAT EXISTING REMOTES HAVE
IF WE CAN BUILD ON THIS WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I'D THOUGHT ABOUT AT ALL BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS
UM AND AND I PRESUME WE CAN MISS OUT THE FUNCTIONS REALLY TO TO A VIDEO OR D. V. D. REMOTE CONTROL
IF THIS IS ONLY GONNA BE A YOU KNOW SATELLITE CABLE T. V.
REMOTE CONTROL
SO THESE ARE TWO MODELS OF EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS
UH THE ONE ON THE LEFT
SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY
UH STANDARD UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL
IT HAS FAST FORWARD STOP PLAY ALL RELATING TO MOVIES
IT ALSO HAS SEEMS TO HAVE CHANNEL UP AND CHANNEL DOWN WHICH IS WHICH IS MORE WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FROM A
YOU KNOW LIKE A SKY OR CABLE REMOTE CONTROL WHERE YOU'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS INSTEAD OF A MERELY TERRESTRIAL ONE
UH BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF THE ONE ON THE RIGHT
WHICH HAS IT ALSO HAS PLAY STOP AND PAUSE AND EVERYTHING I DON'T THINK WE NEED THEM AT ALL
I THINK WE JUST NEED CHANNEL SELECTION
VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN AND
I THINK AN AN ENTER FUNCTION WHERE YOU CAN ACCESS IT'S NOT LIKE TELETEXT BUT ALONG THE SAME LINES ACCESS THINGS ON THE SCREEN
UH
NOT RELATED TO THE INTERNET ONE THAT YOU MENTIONED BECAUSE THAT'D BE FAR OUTSIDE OUR BUDGET AND WHAT WE WANT THIS TO DO
SO IT REALLY EXCEED THE REQUIREMENTS 'CAUSE THE REQUIREMENTS REALLY ARE JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE CHANNELS AND FUNCTIONS WHICH
IS MORE A TEXT ON THE SCREEN THING THAN UH THAN ACTUAL BUTTONS O I WAS THINKING SOMETHING SOME SMOOTH
SLEEK LITTLE REMOTE CONTROL WITH BIG USER FRIENDLY BUTTONS AND UH A MENU THAT YOU CAN ACCESS
UH BUT THEN I DO THINK WE NEED TO DISCUSS THE SPEECH
UM RECOGNITION POSSIBILITY
NO
BUT WE COULD GO BACK TO THE PICTURES OF THE
UH WHAT'RE THEY CALLED
THE PICTURES OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS
AND POSSIBLY DISCUSS WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THEM BUT MAYBE SHOULD HEAR WHAT KATE HAS TO SAY FIRST
OKAY THEN
DEFINITELY LESS CLUTTERED AND I MEAN BUT STILL IT'S
SORRY I WAS JUST I'LL JUST UH RESUME SOMETHING ELSE I WAS GONNA SAY
THE THE STYLE OF THESE IS TERRIBLE
I I I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO UH
NOT ONLY POSSIBLY EVEN MATERIALS LIKE THE TYPE OF PLASTIC USED BUT EVERYTHING INCLUDING SIZE AND SHAPE OF BUTTONS
POSITIONING OF BUTTONS THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF THE HAND HELD DEVICE COLOURS
JUST EVERY E YEAH EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS HAS TO BE REVOLUTIONISED
BUT
SO THAT'S THAT FOR NOW
WHOOP
ISN'T THAT YOUR JOB
OH RIGHT
YEAH
IT DOES IT DOES SEEM AS IF WE'RE JUST TO DO SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE AND MASS PRODUCED
THE WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THESE EXISTING MODELS JUST MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT MORE INSPIRED
BUT BASICALLY JUST THE SAME
ALTHOUGH WHAT WHAT UH SUDDENLY CAME INTO MY HEAD IS YOU KNOW HOW THEY ALWAYS TAKE TWO A. A. BATTERIES WHICH WHICH IS REALLY NOT VERY EFFICIENT AT ALL
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE UH YOU KNOW LIKE A RECHARGEABLE INTERNAL BATTERY LIKE WELL LIKE AN M. P. THREE PLAYER DOES
WITH THAT YOU COULD JUS OR A MOBILE PHONE OR WHATEVER
YOU COULD YOU KNOW YOU JUST PLUG INTO A POWER SOURCE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND THEN IT'S RECHARGED FOR AGES AND AGES AND AGES
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY WITH REPLACING A. A. BATTERIES WHICH ARE
YOU'D NEVER NEED UH BATTERIES WOULD Y UH YEAH
AND IT'S NOT STUCK DOWN THE BACK OF THE SOFA
BUT THEN AGAIN I D I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS WITHIN OUR PRICE RANGE OR NOT
WELL IT IS JUST SO ANNOYING HOW
NO BUT JUST A RECHARGEABLE INTERNAL BATTERY WOULD PROBABLY I MEAN IT MIGHT COST MORE TO AT FIRST TO DEVELOP AND TO INSTALL
BUT FOR LONG TERM USE IT'LL BE SO MUCH MORE CONVENIENT AND ECONOMIC THAN FIDDLING AROUND TRYING TO REPLACE CHUNKY A. A. BATTERIES AND NOT HAVING ANY IN YOUR KITCHEN DRAWER AND
YOU KNOW F
MM
SORT OF HAVE ITS LITTLE DOCK THAT YOU COULD PUT IT IN
STILL I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S QUITE WITHIN OUR PRICE RANGE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S PROBABLY MORE WHAT IT IS
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY RESOLUTIONS BY THE END OF THE DAY ARE WE
YEAH
SORRY I WAS MILES AWAY
I WAS RE I WAS READING THE CHART TO BE HONEST
WHO'S GOT AN IPOD THEN
YEAH THINGS LIKE SCREEN SETTINGS AND AUDIO SETTINGS I WOULD GENERALLY
DO THEM ON THE ACTUAL TELEVISION ITSELF LIKE HERE YOU HAVE A
YOU KNOW A LITTLE FLAP TH WITH A LITTLE CONTROL PANEL ON THE ACTUAL BOX ITSELF
I I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT USING A REMOTE CONTROL SO
UM I WOULD SAY THAT THEY ARE DEFINITELY LESS RELEVANT
YES
WE DIDN'T COME TO ANY SORT OF DECISION ON THE FUNCTIONS THOUGH
ALRIGHT WELL THAT'S FINE THEN
MM
SORRY WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY ARE THESE IS THAT THE YELLOW AND BLACK
FROM THEIR I'LL JUST USE IT FROM THEIR WEBSITE
OKAY
YES
MM-HMM
OKAY I ACCEPT THE MINUTES
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY
OKAY
EXCELLENT THANK YOU
OKAY
OKAY THAT LOOKS GOOD
ALRIGHT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
UM
ONE OF THE THE BIGGEST ISSUES I FOUND ABOUT UM FROM LAST MEETING WAS THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO SELL FOUR MILLION OF THESE UM
REMOTE CONTROLS AND I THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY TAKE REAL REACTION IN THE DIRECTION OF OF SIMILAR
OF HANDHELD TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN USED AND ARE USED BY MANY OF US AND TO KIND OF BRING THE REMOTE CONTROL INTO THE SI SAME REALM AS AN ACCESSIBLE UM USEFUL ELECTRONIC DEVICE
AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT IS LOST IN THE COUCH AND WHAT HAVE YOU
SO UM MY MAIN GOAL HERE IS TO RE ENVISION THE REMOTE CONTROL IN IN THIS CONTEXT AND TO THINK ABOUT MENU FUNCTIONALITY AND CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE FACT THAT IT COULD BE INTERACTIVE WITH OTHER TOOLS
UM SOME OF THE RESEARCH UH IN THE MARKET HAS SHOWN THAT PEOPLE REALLY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH REMOTE CONTROLS AS THEY ARE NOW
AND UM THAT MEANS WE DO NEED TO
MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT KEYS OR OR BUTTONS ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL TO PERHAPS KEEP AND AND WHAT ONES TO DISCARD
AND IF WE DEVOTE SOME ENERGY INTO THIS I THINK THE UM RECENT PRODUCTIONS OF REAL REACTION
THE I GO EVERYWHERE POWER AND THE HIGH DEFINITION D. V. D. PLAYERS ALTHOUGH IT MAKES IMMEDIATE SENSE TO HAVE OUR REMOTE CONTROL INTERACT WITH THESE
I THINK WE CAN ALSO USE THIS AS A PLATFORM TO MAKE IT INTERACT WITH OTHER TOOLS
AND UM IN FACT I THINK THE HIGH DEFINITION D. V. D. PLAYERS AND ALL OF THIS WILL COME ALONG IN THE UH WILL ONLY BENEFIT FROM THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK
FROM OUR WELL DESIGNED TOOL
SO AGAIN MOST UH USERS REALLY DISLIKE THE CURRENT LOOK AND FEEL OF REMOTE CONTROLS
UM FIFTY PERCENT I THINK OF ALL THESE UH NUMBERS THE MOST IMPORTANT IS FIFTY PERCENT OF USER SAY THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS AND IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS THERE ARE A LOT OF UH TELEVISION D. V. D.
STEREO REMOTE CONTROL USERS OUT THERE EIGHTY PERCENT WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY ON A REMOTE CONTROL THAT LOOKS FANCY
UM IT WAS MARKET RESEARCH AND THERE WERE A HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE ROOM SO EIGHTY OUT OF A HUNDRED SAID THEY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL I THINK WE CAN I I THINK WE CAN REALLY FOCUS ON THIS REMOTE AND AND AGAIN BRING THE REAL REACTION UM BRAND IN IN AND AND GET SOME POSITIVE MARKETING FOR OUR OTHER TOOLS
EVEN IF WE DIRECTLY DON'T UM ADVERTISE FOR THE I GO EVERYWHERE LINE
SO AN INTERESTING UM ELEMENT WAS THE WOULD YOU PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION QUESTION
SO THESE MARKET RESEARCH UH UH QUESTIONNAIRES LOOKED INTO YOUR YOUR UH CONCERN ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND S SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO
FIND OUT INFORMATION ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION
NOW
THE EARLY ADOPTERS THOSE OF US WHO GREW UP WITH TECHNOLOGY AND UH LUCK LUCKY FOR US HAVE THE UH CASH TO TO PAY FOR IT
THE YOUNG AGE GROUP WITHOUT THE MORTGAGES AND RESPONSIBILITIES NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THEM WOULD PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
VERY INTERESTING I I LEAVE THIS UP TO THE GROUP TO DECIDE IF WE WANNA USE THIS UH IF AND YOU KNOW
THE THE DESIGNERS BUT NINETY ONE PERCENT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
WELL I I I THINK ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF GROWTH I THINK THIS WOULD BE A VERY SMART GROUP TO TARGET
I MEAN S THREE QUARTERS OF THE NEXT AGE GROUP TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE ARE INTERESTED
AND UH WITH THE TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVING IF WE CAN GET THESE UH
YEAH
TO
UM YES
YES
BUT WOULD YOU PAY MORE AND DOES IT WORK AND IS IT APPROACHABLE AND AND DID I KNOW THAT IT WAS IT WAS AN THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION
I DON'T KNOW IF SPEECH RECOGNITION SHOULD BE UM SHOULD BE INCLUDED BUT I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING I THINK THAT MAYBE SHOWS MORE ABOUT UH
BEING OPEN TO TECHNOLOGY
SHALL I GO BACK
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
EXACTLY
I MEAN I I I UH DID NOT RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT BUT I THINK THE COMPETITION
SUSSING OUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING AND WHAT'S IN THE PIPELINE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT
BECAUSE UM THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT DO YOU WANT AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND AND THAT WASN'T RESPONDED TO BUT UH SOME OF THE LARGER
REMOTES DO HAVE SCREENS WHERE YOU CAN NAVIGATE YOU KNOW
SO IT TURNS INTO SOMETHING UH PERHAPS YOU ALL HAVE SEEN UH THE OSBOURNES WHERE OZZY OSBOURNE IS IS ATTEMPTING TO MANAGE HIS SUPER ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WITH SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A UH A SMALL TRAY
YOU KNOW IT'S I A AND I THINK YOU KNOW
NO NO YOU KATE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THERE
BUT I THINK THE KEY IS TO GET THE EARLY ADOPTERS PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH TECHNOLOGY AND AND UH THEY'LL BE
UH MM
EXACTLY
I YES
AND I'M MAKING AND I'M MAKING THE THE UH UH LEAP THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMILIAR YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE L ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH TECHNOLOGY THAN THAN OLDER PEOPLE
OR COMFORTABLE YOU KNOW UM SO
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS AN ATTRACTIVE STREAMLINED REMOTE CONTROL AND TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY REDUCTIONIST POWER CHANNEL VOLUME AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS IS UH
UP TO THE DESIGNERS
AND THIS IS THIS IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE MARKET RESEARCH
THANK YOU
THAT'S MY CONTRIBUTION
OR IF
YEAH
MAYBE AFTERWARDS WE COULD DO A UH WHITEBOARD WITH THAT YOUR THE ONE ON THE RIGHT AS A AS A
BASIS
WHITEBOARD SESSION
MM-HMM
THE ERGONOMICS THE WAY IT FITS IN YOUR
YEAH
DO WE HAVE UM
KI SOME IDEA OF HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO CREATE A DEVICE THAT HAS THESE BASIC ELEMENTS
BECAUSE THEN
NO THE CHIP COMPOSER MARKETING
OH NO THE CHIP COMPOSER SENDER
I I DON'T BELIEVE I KNOW UM
OKAY
BE BECAUSE THEN WE WOULD HA HA FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WE HAD TO PLAY WITH IN TERMS OF USER INTERFACE AND THIS LOOK AND FEEL IDEA
MM-HMM
INSPIRED
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL THAT HAS ANOTHER ELEMENT WHICH IS IF EVERY TIME YOU'RE DONE USING THE REMOTE YOU PUT IT ON A CHARGER THEN YOU THEN IT HAS A PLACE
YEAH BUT IT ALSO HAS A PLACE SO EXACTLY
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA
WELL IT'S BETTER THAN MY IDEA ABOUT SOLAR PROBABLY
YEAH YEAH
DEPEN
MM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
DEFINITELY 'CAUSE I'M THINKING IN TERMS OF UM UH
THE
LOSS AND BREAKAGE OF UM REMOTES HOW MUCH OF THAT IS IS TO DO WITH IT NOT REALLY HAVING A UH A HOME
A UM A NEST A PLACE TO LIVE EXACTLY
SO IF YOU CAN DOCK IT UM YOU KNOW YOU COULD S ARGUE THAT THIS IS
EXACTLY
MM
'CAUSE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER COMPONENT LIKE ANOTHER PIECE OF HARDWARE
MM
WELL I I BROUGHT UP SOME EXACTLY BUT I THINK YOU RAISED SOME GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT ARE THERE ENOUGH OF THESE PEOPLE OUT THERE
OR ARE THEY MAKING PURCHASING DECISIONS
YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE
YEAH EXACTLY
OH OH OH I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF THAT KATE
GOOD GOOD COMMENT
YEAH
IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO KNOW UM UH WHO YOU KNOW WHO'S ACTUALLY BUYING TELEVISIONS AND ARE WE IN A UH UH S
REGION WHERE PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION IN A HOME
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND AND SOME OF OUR D. V. D. PLAYERS INCIDENTALLY HAVE THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR OWN DEPARTMENT BUT MOREOVER WE NEED TO
TO GO FOR THE THE MANUFACTURERS
MM
DO WE NEED UM LET ME
BR ACTUALLY UM
THE ENTER KEY I HAVE A CHART HERE THAT I DIDN'T INCLUDE
UM
YEAH WHICH MIGHT
TH YEAH TH THOSE ARE
FELT LIKE HAD A LOT OF CHARTS
OKAY
I I MY ONLY COMMENT IS I THINK MAYBE UM WE COULD SOMEHOW INCLUDE AN ENTER KEY IN LIKE A POWER KEY IF POWER POWER WAS ENTER AND POW THAT WAS MY ONLY JUST REALLY IN TERMS OF STREAMLINING
UM
EXACTLY
AGAIN YOU KNOW THINKING OF MENUS OR
UM
WELL IF YOU'RE PRESSING ENTER THE THE THING WOULD ALREADY BE ON AND SO MAYBE UM WHEN YOU PRESS POWER INITIALLY IT TURNS IT ON
PRESS POWER AGAIN AND USE THAT AS AN ENTER UM SO YOU PRESS POWER AFTER YOU'VE UM WELL I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU TO TURN IT OFF YOU'D HAVE TO PRESS POWER TWICE IN SUCCESSION
AND MAYBE POWER FOLLOWS SOMETHING LIKE A CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN POWER AND THEN THAT WOULD MAKE THAT CHOICE
WELL
OR Y YEAH
OR SOMETHING THAT HAS A A TURNING DIAL WHERE AT THE FAR END IS ON OR OFF
YEAH I DON'T UM I WISH
ANYWAY UH THAT WAS THE ONLY COMMENT ABOUT UM SOME OF THE THE DECISIONS
PEOPLE HAVE MADE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
IT'S DEFINITELY CHANNEL VOLUME POWER
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
YEAH
OKAY WELL
THANKS FOR LOOKING AT THAT
MM-HMM
WE DON'T WANNA OUTSMART
HMM
CONGRATULATIONS
D
OH YOU'RE FINE
IT'S FINE
I THINK YOU HAVE TO CYCLE THROUGH
OKAY
UM AND YOU'D MENTIONED I I WAS JUST GONNA SAY COULD YOU REITERATE THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
BECAUSE IT THEY WERE IT HAS TO BE FOR A T. V. JUST TO KEEP MYSELF
YEAH I THINK I'VE
OKAY
MM
RIGHT
THANK YOU
HI KATE
OKAY CARRY ON
ALRIGHT UM THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD MEETING THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
UM OUR AGENDA SHOULD BE UM THAT WE'RE OPENING THE MEETING I HAVE THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING ARE ON THE SHARED F DRIVE AT THIS POINT
UM AND WE SHOULD EACH HAVE A PRESENTATION TO MAKE
UM WE HAVE CERTAIN DECISIONS TO MAKE AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES TOTAL
IT'S TWENTY FIVE AFTER TWO AT THE MOMENT SO FORTY MINUTES IS FIVE AFTER THREE UM WHICH I'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE CLOCK FOR US
OKAY
UM THERE ARE THE DECISIONS WE HAVE TO TURN TO BUT WE'LL COME BACK TO THEM IN A MINUTE AFTER I TAKE US TO THE
MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING
RIGHT UM AS WE REMEMBER I OPENED THE MEETING THE FOUR OF US WERE PRESENT THE MEETING THE FIRST MEETING'S MINUTES WERE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
UM SARAH YOU PRESENTED A MARKETING RESEARCH REPORT UM WHICH PRETTY MUCH REP REPRESENTED THAT FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLDS UH IT HAS TO BE HAND HELD
POWER CHANNEL VOLUME NUMBER KEYS POSSIBLY A SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND THEN STEPH DID A SECOND PRESENTATION UM THAT THOSE FUNCTIONS PLUS STREAMLINING THEM WITH BIG USER FRIENDLY KEYS THAT WERE EASY TO USE
I THINK ALL OF US AGREED WITH THOSE THINGS
KATE PRESENTED A WORKING DESIGN OF GOING AFTER GOING OVER THE BASICS ON THE WHITEBOARD UM THAT IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MASS PRODUCED DEVICE
BECAUSE OF THE TWELVE AND A HALF PENCE COST
UM BUT WE DID TALK ABOUT POSSIBLY USING RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES AND HAVING A DOCKING PLACE AS A SELLING POINT
UM AND THE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT IT FOR BE FOR T. V. ONLY UM AND THAT IT INCLUDE THE L SO SLOGAN AND COLOUR OF THE UH CORPORATE DESIGN BE INCLUDED
UM
THE CORPORATE IMAGE
SO WE AGREED THAT THE TARGET MARKET WOULD BE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE WITH MORE MONEY THAN SENSE THAT WERE DECISION MAKERS
ALTERNATIVELY IT WOULD BE A MANUFACTURER TO ENCLOSE IT WITH THE T. V. BUT IT STILL SHOULD MEET THOSE PARAMETERS
UM AND THAT THE FUNCTION WE AGREED WAS VOLUME POWER NUMBERS ENTER CHANNELS A WAY TO MOVE BETWEEN CHANNELS EASY TO USE AND HAND HELD
UM AT THAT POINT WE AGREED THAT SARAH WOULD LOOK AT THE CURRENT COST OF COMPETITION WHAT WHAT DO THE CURRENT ONES SELL FOR
UM AND STEPH WAS GONNA LOOK AT EC ERGONOMICS
KATE WAS GONNA LOOK AT COST AND FEASIBILITY OF THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES THAT WE DISCUSSED
AND I WAS TO TYPE UP THESE MINUTES AND WORK ON THE FINAL REPORT
IS THIS A FAIR PRESENTATION OF WHAT OUR LAST MEETING WAS
OKAY
RIGHT
SO WE'RE READY TO CLOSE THAT AND GO BACK TO OUR
THAT ONE
RIGHT
WE'RE UP TO THE POINT OF THE
GO BACK
UM THE THREE PRESENTATIONS
SO WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE PLUG ON ME AND TURN TO SARAH
IS THAT OKAY
IS THAT ALRIGHT WITH EVERYBODY ELSE
ESPECIALLY SINCE KATE ASKED TO BE LAST
SARAH I'M SORRY IF I MISSPELLED YOUR NAME I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS S. A. R. A. OR S. A. R. H.
YOU RESPOND TO WHATEVER YOU GET HUH
OKAY
UM DID YOU DO YOUR HIT
AH THERE IT IS
TA DA
MM 'KAY
'KAY
MM
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE THE UH COVERS THAT THEY USE FOR THE REMOTE YOU KNOW YOUR T YOUR CELL PHONE
MM
HMM
UH-HUH MM
IN MOST FAMILIES DON'T ISN'T THE REMOTE IS A REMOTE
MM
MM
WELL ACTUALLY SOME HOUSEHOLDS DO HAVE THREE AND FOUR T. V. S AND THEY WOULD HAVE A REMOTE FOR EACH ONE SO
HMM
HMM
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE DEVICE ITSELF OR THE C OR A COVER FOR THE DEVICE THAT WOULD BE AN INTERCHANGEABLE COV COVER AS A SEPARATE
PRODUCT
PERHAPS PERHAPS THAT DESI THAT PARTICULAR SUGGESTION NEEDS TO GO BACK TO MANAGEMENT AND PERHAPS GO TO ANOTHER GROUP TO ACTUALLY DESIGN AS A SEPARATE PRODUCT
WO WOULD THAT BE AGREEABLE
DO YOU WANNA BE NEXT OR YOU WANT KATE TO GO NEXT
OKAY WE'LL MOVE THE
MM
MM
ALRIGHT
REMEMBER WE ONLY HAVE FORTY MINUTES
HMM
MM
HMM
HMM
THANK YOU KATE
YES
THERE WE GO
DO IT AGAIN
KEEP DOING IT UNTIL YOU GET IT IN BOTH YOU GET IT THERE YOU GET IT YOURS WITHOUT THAT ONE AND THEN YOU GET IT WITH BOTH
YEAH
THIS TIME IT SHOULD COME UP BOTH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
HMM
MM
HUH
IT'S A SELECTION WHEEL
OKAY
OKAY
OR CALL IT A OR CALL IT A BANANA AND HAVE IT IN YELLOW
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
HMM
MM 'KAY
I WANNA THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL YOUR PRESENTATIONS
WE HAVE ABOUT TEN MINUTES LEFT IN WHICH TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS
UM AND I THINK YOU ALL HAVE BEEN SELF STIMULATING OF WORKING TOGETHER
UM WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME SPECIFICS OF THE COMPONENTS UM THE MATERIALS
THINGS LIKE MAKING THE DECISION ON THE ENERGY UM AND THE CASE AND THE INTERFACE TYPE THINGS
SO LET'S
MM
RIGHT
THEY WANT US TO DECIDE
WHAT FORM OF ENERGY ARE WE GOING TO USE
WHICH THE CHOICES THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED WERE PRETTY MUCH BATTERY KINETIC OR SOLAR
UM THIS IS WHERE KATE'S EXPERTISE COMES IN AND OUR DECISION MAKING WILL BE A LITTLE BIT GUIDED BY KATE AT THIS POINT
THE
YOU WERE SAYING THAT THE KINETIC WOULD BE USEFUL
THAT IS YOU JUST HAVE TO MOVE IT SOME AND YOU'D BE ABLE TO USE IT UM AS OPPOSED TO A BATTERY THAT YOU HAVE TO EITHER PUT IT IN A RECHARGER OR UM KEEP REPLACING THE BATTERIES
UM
OR SOLAR THAT YOU'D HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH IT IF IT'S A DARK DAY THAT IT'LL DIE ON YOU AND NO WAY TO DO IT
THAT'S THE DAY YOU WANNA USE THE T. V.
UM SO WHAT'S OUR PLEASURE HERE WHAT WOULD BE THE COST CONSEQUENCES OF EACH OF THE THREE
OKAY
MM 'KAY
WHAT'S THE UH FEELINGS OF THE GROUP ON THE KINETIC
HMM
HMM
SO THE CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE USE THE KINETIC IF IT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE
IT COSTS
MM
MM
MM
HMM
YEAH
THANKS FOR THE REMINDER FOR FIVE MINUTES TO FINISH THANKS
UM THE NEXT THING THAT THEY WANTED US TO DO WAS LOOK AT CHIP ON PRINT AS A DECISION
OH
OKAY
WHAT ABOUT THE CA YEAH
OH THE WAY WE UH-HUH
OH OKAY
UM WHAT ABOUT THE CASE
I THINK THEY'RE TALKING THERE ABOUT DO WE WANT WOOD PLASTIC TITANIUM OR RUBBER AND I THINK WE'VE DISCUSSED NOT HAVING TITANIUM
ONE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE UM AND SECOND IT WON'T DO THIS DOUBLE UM CURVES
UM WE'VE SORT OF ELIMINATED WOOD
WE SAID PLASTIC OR RUBBER
WHAT'S THE PLEASURE
WHAT ABOUT YOU
COVER
UH-HUH
PLASTIC INSIDE
HMM
OKAY
UM THE NEXT PART THEY WANT IS THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT
I'M SORRY TO PUSH YOU BUT WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES TO FINISH WITH
OKAY AND IT SAYS INTERFACE
WHAT TYPE AND WHAT SUPPLEMENTS
OKAY UM
THAT'S THAT
UM THIS IS GONNA SOUND WEIRD BUT THE NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES
WHEW
AND THEY ACTUALLY WANT A LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN USER INTERFACE DESIGN YOU CAN LOOK AND SEE THIS AS WELL AS I CAN
MARKETING THEY WANT PRODUCT EVALUATION
OH
OH MY I'M SORRY
OH OKAY
SORRY ABOUT THAT
MISSED THAT ONE
THIS OUGHT TO BE FUN TRYING TO GET THIS THING TO WORK
AH TA DA
AH
YES BECAUSE I CAN'T EVEN SEE MINE
NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
YEAH RIGHT
UM THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN IS FOR KATE UH STEPH GETS THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN YOU GET PRODUCT EVALUATION
UM THE TWO OF YOU GET TO PLAY WITH A PLA MODELLING CLAY UM TO DO A PROTOTYPE
UH AND EVERYBODY GETS INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTIONS IN THE USUAL WAY
ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED TO DO
GO TO IT
AND THAT'S THE END OF THIS MEETING
THAT'S FOR HER BENEFIT
JUST JUST CARRY ON
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SORRY
I'M GLAD TO SEE THE MARKETING BUDGET IS BEING SO WELL SPENT ON
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
DON'T YOU
YEAH I I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME TROUBLE WHEN WE GET DOWN TO THE COMPONENT DESIGN ON THIS
SPONGY IS GONNA BE DIFFICULT I'M AFRAID
YEAH I MEAN BASICALLY WE CAN MAKE THESE THINGS OUT OF WOOD TITANIUM PLASTIC OR RUBBER
I SUPPOSE RUBBER IS THE CLOSEST TO SPONGY YEAH
I WAS THINKING TITANIUM MYSELF
YEAH
W W WOULD IT BE HELPFUL IF UM I DESCRIBED THE COMPONENTS A BIT
BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD GIVE YOU UM MAYBE BRING THIS DISCUSSION BACK TO EARTH OF WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY DO
RIGHT WELL I I I THINK SOME OF THIS UM YOU'RE GONNA BE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH SOME OF THE THINGS I HAVE TO TELL YOU
BUT I'M AFRAID THIS IS THE REAL WORLD
SO UM
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE THE BASICS OF HOW THESE DEVICES ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK IN ORDER TO OPERATE
AND I'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MA MANUFACTURING DIVISION WHO HAVE TOLD ME WHAT'S ACTUALLY AVAILABLE
YOU KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART IN COMPONENTS IS AND SOME OF THE EXCITING NEW THINGS THEY'VE GOT
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S QUITE WHAT YOU WANT UM
NOW THIS ISN'T A VERY GOOD OVERHEAD BUT THIS IS JUST TO SHOW YOU THIS IS THE INNARDS OF A REMOTE CONTROL UM
I REALLY NEED A PEN OR SOMETHING BUT UH DOES MY MOUSE WORK
NO
UM OH YEAH CAN YOU SEE MY LITTLE MOUSE POINTER
RIGHT
THIS IS THIS IS THE A A A REMOTE THAT'S BEEN OPENED UP AND THAT'S THE THE BACK OF THE INTERFACE
AND THIS IS A PUSH BUTTON ONE SO YOU SEE THESE LITTLE LITTLE BUTTONS HERE
THEY'RE LITTLE RUBBER RUBBER BUTTONS THAT GO THROUGH ONTO THE THE BOARD AT THE BACK AND THEY PUSH THESE BUTTONS HERE
UM AND WE THAT'S THE BASIC CONSTRUCTION THAT WE'VE GOT TO GOT TO ACCOMMODATE
WE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT PUSHES THE LITTLE BUTTONS THAT UM TALK TO THE CHIP THAT ENCODES THE MESSAGE THAT SENDS THE THE MESSAGE TO THE RECEIVER
SO UM I WAN I WANNA GO THROUGH NOT NOT JUST ADDRESSING THE UM UH THE THE POINTS THAT YOU MADE
SARAH BUT UM DOING MY PRESENTATION IN THE ORDER I WROTE IT
SO FIRST OF ALL UM I WANNA TALK ABOUT WHAT POSSIBILITIES WE'VE GOT FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE
UM WE CAN HAVE YOUR BOG STANDARD DOUBLE DOUBLE A. BATTERIES IN A REPLACEABLE UM LITTLE COMPARTMENT
WE CAN HAVE A HAND SORRY A WIND UP YEAH WHICH I THINK IS QUITE AN INTERESTING CONCEPT FOR A SORRY FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
BUT I IT MAYBE IS DOESN'T QUITE GO WITH THE UM THE FRUIT AND VEG
UM ONE THAT ONE THAT I THINK IS QUITE INTERESTING IS THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE
WHERE UM YOU YOU ACTUALLY GET THE ENERGY BY MOVING THE DEVICE WHICH IS QUITE A NI A NICE AND NEAT ONE
YOU HAVE TO IT MEANS THAT IF IT'S SITTING THERE FOR A LONG TIME IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK
BUT YOU HAVE TO SORT OF THROW IT BETWEEN YOUR HANDS EVERY NOW AND THEN IT'LL WORK
OR WE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT SOLAR POWER BUT I THING THAT WE AGREED THAT THAT'S NOT SO GOOD IN THE DARK
NOW I'M AFRAID THIS IS THE OPTIONS WE'VE GOT ON ON THE CASE
IT CAN BE MADE OF PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD O IF YOU LIKE OR TITANIUM
UM AND THE NEAREST WE'VE GOT TO ST TO SPONGY THERE I GUESS IS RUBBER BUT UM
I'M GONNA COME BACK TO THE ADVANTAGES OF TITANIUM AND BASICALLY IT CAN HAVE A FLAT SURFACE A CURVED SURFACE OR A DOUBLE CURVED SURFACE
BUT I THINK IF WE WANNA USE STANDARD COMPONENTS WE'RE GONNA HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH ANYTHING MUCH BEYOND THAT
OKAY WHAT DOES THE INTERFACE LOOK LIKE
UM WELL PUSH BUTTON THAT'S THAT'S THE ONE WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH
UM WE CAN HAVE SCROLL BUTTONS AND THE THE SCROLL BUTTON CAN INCORPORATE A PUSH
SO YOU CAN HAVE IT LIKE ON A MOUSE WHERE YOU CAN USE IT TO GO UP AND DOWN
CHANGE VOLUME OR CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND PUSH TO
SELECT SOMETHING
UM YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE SCROLL BUTTONS UM THIS IS MAYBE GETTING A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED BUT UM IT'S IT THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE
AND WE CAN ALSO INCORPORATE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY IN THE REMOTE BUT THIS WILL INCREASE THE COST
UM THE ELECTRONICS THAT ACTUALLY MAKES THE DEVICE WORK WE'VE BASICALLY GOT THREE
SIMPLE REGULAR ADVANCED AND THE PRICE GOES UP AS WE CHOOSE EACH OF THIS
IF WE WANT THE NICE CHEAP ONE THE SIMPLE THEN WE CAN ONLY HAVE PUSH BUTTONS
ALL THE OTHER FANCY INTERFACE DESIGNS GO OUT THE WINDOW I'M AFRAID
UM PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR A REGULAR CHIP AND YOU CAN HAVE SCROLL BUTTONS
IF YOU WANT THE ADVANCED CHIP IT OBVIOUSLY COSTS MORE BUT IT THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED IF YOU WANT THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
AND THE MANUFACTURING DEVISION TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED UM SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER DEVICES
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS BUT I THINK THEY THINK IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT AND WE MIGHT WANT TO INCORPORATE IT SOMEWHERE
UM OU OUR REAL EXPERTISE IS IN PUSH BUTTONS I HAVE TO SAY BUT MAYBE YOU THINK THAT'S OLD TECHNOLOGY
AND WELL I I THINK WE'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS
WE CAN EITHER GO FOR A REALLY CHEAP MODEL KEEP ALL OF THE COSTS DOWN
UM WHICH MEANS A FLAT PLASTIC CASE WITH AN ORDINARY BATTERY AND SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS
OR WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS A BIT NICER I THINK IT UM WON'T NECESSARILY L UH LOOK LIKE A PINEAPPLE BUT UM
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE A GOOD THING
SORRY
UM BUT IT COULD HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND IT COULD HAVE MULTIPLE SCROLL BUTTONS
AND IT COULD HAVE THE THE COMPANY'S NEW DEVELOPMENT OF THE UM SAMPLE SENSOR AND SPEAKER
SO THANK YOU
YEAH I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE
UM
MANUFACTURING DIDN'T ACTUALLY GIVE ATTACH ANY PRICES TO ANY OF THIS I'M AFRAID
YEAH MM-HMM
BANANA
WE WE COULD WE COULD DO UM A DOUBLE CURVED RUBBER ONE WHICH WOULD ALLOW UM SAY A BANANA
BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY I SEE FROM MY NOTES THAT IF WE DO THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A PUSH BUTTON AS THE INTERFACE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING FANCIER
YEP
I IF YOU DO F. UH F. N. F. EIGHT AGAIN IT'S IT'LL
I THINK IT YEAH YOU YOU WILL DO AN
HMM
HMM
YEAH
YEAH I'D I'D CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT IDEA
IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE FANCY SHAPES IN IT AS WELL WE CAN'T FOR EXAMPLE HAVE A DOUBLE CURVED CASE IN TITANIUM UNFORTUNATELY
AND THE THE HAVING THE THE THE SCREEN ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA
'CAUSE UM OTHERWISE WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING UP THE PRICE NOT ONLY FOR PUTTING BUILDING THE L. C. D. IN BUT FOR THE ELECTRONICS AS WELL
THERE IS THAT
DO YOU WANT SCROLL BUTTONS IN THAT AS WELL
MM-HMM
RIGHT
YEAH
I THINK I THINK THAT'S A G NICE CLEAN DESIGN IT'S PLAYING TO OUR STRENGTHS WHICH ARE IN PUSH BUTTON TECHNOLOGY
YEAH
BUT WE CAN IMPLEMENT IT WITH SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS WHICH IS MUCH CHEAPER
IN FACT
OH THAT'S REALLY NICE
HMM
MM
WE WE COULD ACTUALLY DO IT IN RUBBER INSTEAD OF PLASTIC IF YOU'D RATHER IF YOU FEEL IF YOU LIKE THE SPONGY
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
OH UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE COSTING INFORMATION
I I IN TERMS OF WORKABILITY I I THINK THE THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS ARE THE STANDARD BATTERY OR THE KINETIC
BUT I'M SORRY I DON'T FIGURES ON THE DIFFERENCE IN COST
AND AND HOW MUCH YOU DO HAVE TO KEEP IT MOVING 'CAUSE I'M CONSCIOUS THAT WATCHING T. V. CAN BE QUITE A SED SEDENTARY ACTIVITY
YEAH
TRUE YEAH M MORE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
OH RIGHT OKAY I'D THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I MAYBE SHOULD HAVE COVERED
UM
CHIP ON PRINT IS JUST A MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUE UM AND I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT I THINK BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE
I I IT IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT THE THE THE UH TH THE WAY IT'S AC IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT AND YOU YOU PRINT ONTO THE CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE YOU MIGHT PRINT ONTO PAPER
WELL IF IF SARAH'S KEEN ON A SPONGY FEEL
THE THE RUBBER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE SAME AS YOU HAVE IN THOSE LITTLE STRESS BALLS SO IT'S YEAH
YEAH
I'D I'D NEED TO TALK TO MANUFACTURING AGAIN ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S ACTUALLY POSSIBLE BUT I AGREE IT'S UH SOUNDS LIKE A NICE IDEA IF IT IS
I SHOULD I SHOULD R
WHICH I THINK TECHNICALLY IS JUST PUSH BUTTON AND UH I'D CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT THAT THAT BRINGS THE COST DOWN QUITE A LOT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE AN EX THE COMPANY'S AN EXPERT ON
YOU KNOW I THINK THE THE COMPANY'S S NEXT PROJECT SHOULD TO DESIGN A BETTER OVERHEAD DEVICE THAT SWITCHES IMMEDIATELY
YEAH
YES
YEP
YEAH
RIGHT
YES
SO WHEN YOUR DAD'S SITTING THERE OVERRIDING YOUR DECISION
GOING NO WE'RE GONNA WATCH THIS YOU CAN BRING OUT YOUR OWN REMOTE AND BE LIKE ZAP NO WE'RE GONNA WATCH THIS
YEP
AND AS FOR
AS FOR UM WELL BUDGETING AS WELL IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT INTERCHANGEABLE
COMPONENTS
IS THIS TO THE MARKET
I WAS THINKING TITANIUM I WAS THINKING IT'S JUST I HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY PICTURES OF IPODS AND THEY'RE ALSO MINIMALIST AND SHINY
YEAH BUT IT'S KIND OF POINTLESS ISN'T IT
YEAH
LET'S DELEGATE
YEAH MAYBE
OR
I THINK POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE MORE USEFUL IF KATE WENT NEXT
UM
YOU CAN EVEN HAVE THEM IN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS AS WELL
SO THAT IF YOU JUST WANNA SIT THERE AND CHEW ON THE REMOTE IT COULD BE LIKE PEAR FLAVOUR YEAH
SCRATCH AND SNIFF
A WIND UP
BEAR BEAR IN MIND IT HAS TO BE THE COLOURS AND STYLES OF THE COMPANY
SO WHAT I HAD BEEN THINKING WAS SOMETHING CHUNKY AND YELLOW AND PLASTIC WITH BLACK BUTTONS WITH A LOGO ON IT
BUT UM
I I DON'T KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO KEEP IT EXACTLY THE COLOURS OF THE REAL REACTION COMPANY
IT'S JUST WHAT I'D UNDERSTOOD WE'D BE DOING
THAT'S BEFORE I HEARD ABOUT ALL THIS HOT TIPS ABOUT THE FUTURE FRUIT WISE
SHALL WE WAIT 'TIL I'VE 'TIL I'VE SHOWED YOU WHAT WELL MY EXTENSIVE PRESENTATION ON WHAT SORT OF INTERFACES ARE AVAILABLE
YOU DID SEEM TO INCLUDE JUST IN MORE DETAIL WHAT I'VE GOT THOUGH
SO SO MINE'S A BIT POINTLESS
RIGHT
F. N. AND F. EIGHT DID YOU SAY
I DON'T HAVE IT ON MINE THOUGH
SHOULD I DO IT AGAIN
RIGHT THEN
I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENT INFORMATION THEN WHAT KATE SAYS JUST
THAT MY METHOD WAS TO LOOK AT THE WELL MY MY INSPIRATIONS
WHICH WAS A BIG COLLECTION OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT MODELS OF REMOTE CONTROLS AND OTHER THINGS THAT USE A SIMILAR SORT OF THING INCLUDING M. P. THREE PLAYERS UH
LIKE YOU KNOW HI FI REMOTES NOT JUST TELEVISION AND THESE THINGS
UH HAVING A THINK ABOUT THE FEATURE OF EA THE FEATURES OF EACH ONES
UM WHAT FUNCTIONS WE ACTUALLY NEED AND THEN HOW TO GROUP AND ARRANGE THESE ON THE ACTUAL
THE ACTUAL PLASTIC OR RUBBER HAND HELD PIECE
UH I'VE BEEN ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THE IPOD STYLE SCROLL WHEEL WHICH
WELL I COULDN'T FIND A THE PICTURE OF THE IPOD W ONLY LINKED TO A WEB BROWSER
SO I COULDN'T COPY AND PASTE IT BUT IT HAD A SIMILAR THING TO THIS THING ON THE RIGHT
IT HAS UH SCROLL WHEELS WITHOUT WITHOUT A DISPLAY BUT THEY THEY SCROLL LIKE A COMPUTER MOUSE
SO I WAS THINKING THAT UH UM A REALLY SIMPLE
A REALLY SIMPLE INTERFACE WITH JUST A COUPLE OF SCROLL THINGS ON IT UM AND THEN INSTEAD OF A DISPLAY THE DISPLAY COULD APPEAR ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN
LIKE I GUESS AN EXISTING
SKY OR CABLE ONE DOES
LIKE YOU KNOW YOU PRESS ENTER AND IT COMES UP WITH WHAT'S SHOWING ON THAT CHANNEL AT THE MOMENT
AND YOU CAN DO YOU CAN SCROLL ALONG AND IT'LL SHOW YOU WHAT'S ON IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR
AND YOU SCROLL UP AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S ON THE OTHER CHANNELS WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING
THE SAME CHANNEL ON THE SCREEN
UH BUT I'M ALSO EQUALLY TAKEN WITH THIS CHUNKY PLASTIC KIDDIE REMOTE
UM WHICH IS REALLY NICE AND FUN AND GOOD TO HOLD AND NICE BIG EASY BUTTONS TO PRESS BUT STILL QUITE SIMPLE AND QUITE COST EFFECTIVE
SO
WHAT SEEMS KIND OF IDEAL FOR ME WOULD BE TO JUST HAVE
A FAIRLY SIMPLE UH NOT FANCY BUT NOT TOTALLY MINIMALIST I MEAN JUST PRETTY SIMPLE PLASTIC
PROBABLY I WAS THINKING YELLOW AND BLACK JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE COMPANY'S COLOURS WITH VERY VERY FEW BUTTONS
BUT THAT WOULD CORRESPOND TO A SCREEN THAT WOULD APPEAR ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN LIKE YOU KNOW
JUST SMALL ALONG THE BOTTOM INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF HAVING THE IPOD STYLE DISPLAY SCREEN ON THE ACTUAL REMOTES WHICH IS FAR TOO EXPENSIVE
AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT A SCREEN SITTING THERE IN FRONT OF YOU YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE IT APPEARING UH ON THE SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU
IT DOESN'T OBSCURE MUCH OF THE ACTUAL PICTURE YOU'RE WATCHING
AND SO ON THAT YOU CAN JUST MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS AN EXISTING SKY REMOTE SCROLL ALONG SCROLL UP AND DOWN
AND UH AND I DEFINITELY SUPPORT UH THE USE OF PLASTIC AND OR RUBBER
I MEAN TITANIUM WOULD BE GREAT BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A BIT TOO EXPENSIVE AND TOO KINDA SPACEY
IF WE'RE K TRYING TO KEEP IT
COLOURFUL AND SLIGHTLY ORGANIC THEN I THINK TITANIUM'S TOO
FUTURISTIC
YEAH
WHEREAS A PLASTIC'S SO CHEAP AND EASY AND MOULDABLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE
UH THEN
AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT POINTLESS AS WELL I THINK
LIKE WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU'VE GOT WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE SCREEN THERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANYTHING FANCY JUST A LITTLE MENU SHOWING YEAH
A MENU YOU GO INTO ONE MENU AND THEN IT CAN HAVE YOUR DIFFERENT OPTIONS WHETHER YOU WANNA CHANGE THE SETTINGS OR THE
YOU KNOW YOUR INFORMATION ABOUT PROGRAMME THAT'S ON AT THE MOMENT
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TO TAXING TO UH
S ENGINEER
UM
BUT AS FOR ACTUALLY ARRANGING THEM LET ME GO BACK TO THE
TO THE PICTURE OF THE KIDDIE ONE
AND I QUITE LIKE IT 'CAUSE IT'S JUST SMOOTH AND HAND HELD AND IT'S GOT THESE EASILY REACHABLE BUTTONS THAT QUITE NICELY UH SPACED OUT
SO SOMETHING A BIT LIKE THAT WITH
BUTTONS ARRANGED IN A
KIND OF CIRCLE
UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT
I I WAS THINKING NOT ACTUALLY SCROLL LIKE A LIKE MOUSE SCROLL BUT YOU KNOW A I CAN'T QUITE D UH DESCRIBE IT
YOU SEE
ON THE ONE ON THE RIGHT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM IS THE MOUSE
YEAH SEE WHERE THE MOUSE IS LIKE THIS S STYLE THING WHERE YOU C HAVE UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT
AND ENTER IN THE MIDDLE SO YOU PICK YOUR MENU AND THEN YOUR DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND WHEN WHEN YOU CLICK ON EACH ONE
IT YOU CAN GO INTO A NEW MENU FOR THAT
I'M GETTING A BIT UH SPECIFIC HERE
REALLY WE'D HAVE TO USE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU BUT
IF I DON'T THINK I CAN GET IT UP ON THE SCREEN
AH HERE WE GO
RIGHT
WELL THE IPOD SPINNING WHEEL IS UH REALLY COMPLICATED
IT DOES SCROLL BUT IT IS HUGELY COMPLICATED
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT
THEM THEY'RE TERRIBLE
BUT THEY ALL HAVE THIS THIS FEATURE OF THIS UH
IT'S NOT QUITE A SCROLL WHEEL BUT
IT'S A KIND OF SELECTION IN THIS CIRCLE WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA
YEAH LIKE UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT
WHICH IS GOOD
AND THEN AND THEN
YEAH SO I MEAN EITHER A CHANNEL UP AND DOWN VOLUME UP AND DOWN
NEXT APPEARING PROGRAMMES UP AND DOWN UH AND THEN ALSO WHEN YOU GET INTO THE DIFFERENT MENUS ON THE SCREEN
IT'S GOT YOUR THINGS LIKE SETTINGS AND CONTRAST UP AND DOWN
SO ALL YOU REALLY NEED IS THESE FOUR BUTTONS WITH THE ENTER IN THE MIDDLE
AND THAT'S IT
LOOK AT LOOK AT THIS ONE
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MISPLACE OR L OR LOSE
MIGHT TAKE UP YOUR WHOLE LIVING ROOM
POSSIBLY
YEAH
THAT ALSO IS POSSIBLE
JUST
UH JUST SOMETHING ELSE I NEED TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS HAVE YOU HAVE YOU SEEN THESE ON A REMOTE
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE VOLUME UP AND DOWN BUT THEY BOTH SAY V. ON THEM WHICH WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK AT IT
YOU EXPECT THAT TO BE THE DOWN BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A DOWNWARD POINTING ARROW BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE V. TO INDICATE THAT IT'S THE VOLUME SO
UH WE DO NEED TO AVOID LITTLE AMBIGUITIES LIKE THESE
BUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC VOLUME UP AND DOWN
IF WE'RE HAVING THE SCROLL WHEEL THEN IT'S GONNA DOUBLE UP AS ALL THE OTHER UP AND DOWN FUNCTIONS
BUT THEN THAT'S COMPLICATED
IT SOUNDS GREAT
I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS IT BEFORE BUT IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC
SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE G A REALLY GOOD ECONOMICAL IT WOULD MAKE THE WHOLE THING A LOT LIGHTER MORE CONVENIENT
YEAH
'CAUSE IT'S REALLY A QUITE ATTRACTIVE THOUGHT ISN'T IT
IT'S LIKE YEAH A GOOD SELLING POINT
BUT IT DOES DEPEND HOW MUCH
I MEAN HOW MUCH IT COSTS AND HOW MUCH MORE DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH IT NEEDS
DO YOUR EXERCISES WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING THE T. V.
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING AS WELL
DO YOU NOT THINK IT MIGHT NEED
LIKE A KIND OF
A HARD PLASTIC INNER SHELL WITH THE ACTUAL DELICATE WORKINGS INSIDE AND THEN A KIND OF SPONGY
YEAH S THICK SPONGY COVER SO IT FEELS LIKE THE WHOLE THING'S SPONGY BUT ACTUALLY YOU'RE NOT DAMAGING ANYTHING BY SQUEEZING IT
BECAUSE I MEAN YOU COULD JUST GET CARRIED AWAY WITH THE WITH THE TAC
YEAH
WELL YOU DO GET A BIT CARRIED AWAY WITH THINGS THAT ARE TACTILE YOU JUST WANNA STROKE THEM AND SQUEEZE THEM AND
JUST COPY THE ONE ON THE LEFT
NO UM A SCROLL
WELL LIKE FOUR BUTTONS UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT WITH ENTER IN THE MIDDLE THAT WILL CORRESPOND TO A MENU ON THE SCREEN
YEAH I'D LIKE PUSH BUTTONS WITH
SO PUSH BUTTONS
NO IT'S STILL IT'S STILL PLUGGED IN ON MINE ACTUALLY
NOW IT'S GONE AGAIN
OH YES
GREAT
I DON'T THINK SO
PLAY DOH
I RESPOND TO EITHER
NO WORRIES
OKAY FIRST THING I WANT TO ADDRESS IS UM ONE OF THE POINTS THAT FLORENCE BROUGHT UP WHICH WAS UH CURRENT COST OF THE COMPETITION DEVICES
SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT STEPHANIE UH SHOWED US AND AND THEY'RE UH TWENTY TO SIXTY EUROS DEPENDING ON UH BRANDING
SOME OF THEM THAT HAVE A HIGHER BRAND RECOGNITION ARE ON THE MORE EXPENSIVE END
BUT I THINK THAT WITH THE CURRENT UM PRICE THAT WE'RE SEARCHING FOR WE'RE WELL WITHIN EVEN ON THE LOWER END OF THE UH OF THE MARKET
BUT I'M GOING TO MOVE ON TO MORE INTERESTING UM MORE VIBRANT THINGS
SO I INVESTIGATED THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET IN GREATER DETAIL AND MY UH THE THEME OF WHAT I WAS TO WORK ON WAS UH TREND WATCH
AND
I KNOW THAT YOU ALL ARE A DISTANCE FROM CUTTING EDGE MARKETING RESEARCH SO YOU KNOW I'M JUST GONNA TRY TO CLOAK IT IN REALLY PROFESSIONAL TERMS HERE
WHAT'S HOT FRUIT AND VEG
SPONGY
AND THIS IS ALL OVER THE CATWALKS PARIS MILAN AND I'M TALKING ABOUT CLOTHING FURNITURE SHOES
THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING CHANGE FROM PAST YEARS BECAUSE IT IS MUCH MORE ORGANIC UM SOME WOULD SAY APPROACHABLE
AND I THINK IF WE'RE TO REFASHION OUR VIEW OF WHAT WE WANT IN A REMOTE CONTROL WE SHOULD PERHAPS THINK ABOUT INCORPORATING TECHNOLOGICALLY INTERESTING FABRICS
AND SOME OF THE BOLD COLOURS INTO A SIMPLE
HANDSET
SO
I ALSO DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON UM
WHAT AGAIN ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES IN UH DECISION MAKING ABOUT UH PURCHASING
FANCY
FUNCTIONAL IS OUT
AND F THE FANCY AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE TERM I'M I'M THINKING POLISHED ELEGANT YOU KNOW KIND OF INNOVATIVE BUT A CUT ABOVE
THIS IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE NEXT FINDING WHICH IS TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
THIS IS INTERESTING 'CAUSE I THINK IN THE LAST MEETING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AS BEING SO IMPORTANT
BUT MAYBE WHAT'S INNOVATIVE IS HAVING IT SIMPLE WITH UM WITH UH TECHNOLOGICALLY SUPERIOR FABRICS OR UH YOU KNOW DESIGNED IN INTERESTING SUBSTANCES
EASE OF USE
AGAIN PRETTY LOW I MEAN IT'S THE TOP THREE BUT EACH OF THE UH FANCY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT
SO
I THINK WE SHOULD CLOAK THE STREAMLINED REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE IN A SERIES OF FRUIT FRUIT THEMED SLEEVES
Y YEAH YOU KNOW
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
I WAS THINKING THOUGH THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING SOMETHING UH LIKE PATTERNED YOU KNOW SO YOU KNOW SOMETHING SIMILAR TO A SUMMER DRESS
YOU KNOW IT WOULD HAVE LIKE FRUIT AND VEG IS THAT WE ACTUALLY MAKE THESE SPONGY
THEY COULD BE INI INITIALLY I THOUGHT WE COULD START WITH KIND OF UM FRUIT THAT WOULD SUIT KIND OF UH A LONG UH HAND HELD
SO BANANA PINEAPPLE AND PEAR
UM IT COULD ACTUALLY THE SLEEVE COULD TAKE UP A LOT OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE REMOTE CONTROL WE'D JUST NEED TO GET REDUCTIONIST ON IT
THEY COULD BE INTERCHANGEABLE THEY'RE SPONGY THAT GOES BACK TO ERGONOMIC
AND THE YOUNGSTERS LOVE 'EM FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY EVERYONE CAN HAVE THEIR OWN
SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CHANGING
THIS CONCEPT
EVERYONE HAS A T. V. REMOTE BUT THEN WE ADD IN THE FACT THAT THEY COULD EACH HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL FRUIT
THAT'S WHAT'S HOT ON THE CATWALKS
SO THIS IS MY
THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING
Y YEAH
BUT I THINK I THINK WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW IS PERHAPS A PERSON IN THE FAMILY WHO HAD THE MOST OPINION ABOUT IT WE ALL NEED A REMOTE
BUT THE PERSON WHO IS REALLY PERHAPS ACTIVE IN PERSONALISING
I'M THINKING THE TEENAGER
THE SOMEONE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE WOULD GO OUT AND GET THIS ADDITIONAL THING THE SAME WAY AS YOU MENTIONED THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET THE CELL PHONE COVERS
YEAH
W AND PLUS I THINK
UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO THIS IS AN IDEA AND I I YOU KNOW THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE RESEARCH HAS UH HAS SHOWN
SO I REALLY OPEN THIS UP TO UH ANY OTHER FEEDBACK
THIS SPONGY FRUIT AND VEG
THANKS
ALRIGHT
I I JUST HAVE MY EAR TO THE MARKET GUYS
IS SPONGIEST YEAH
THAT WOULD ADD
MM-HMM
THEY ARE AND THEY THEY WOULD FULFIL THE UH FIRST UM PRIORITY WHICH IS FANCY
I THINK MANY OF US WOULD ASSOCIATE THOSE WITH FANCY
SOMETHING ELSE WE COULD DO IS UH
CALL IT SOMETHING THAT'S FRUIT AND VEG
ORIENTED
WE COULD CALL IT UH
THE NAME
WELL IT WOULD BE UH A A VERY SIMPLE PRODUCT THAT WOULD HAVE A SPONGY SLEEVE THAT WOULD BE INTERCHANGEABLE
SO
THAT YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE
AND THEN WE COULD KEEP IT TITANIUM
YEAH
OR S OR SMELLY
SCRATCHY
UH WELL I WAS REALLY THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE I. UH THE IMAC KIND OF GEL GEM TONE
IT'S HOT ON THE STREETS GUYS
MM
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
MM
THAT SOUNDS GOOD
ANY IDEA YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WOULD BE A COST DIFFERENCE
UM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA IF IF THIS COULD IF THE FANCY MODEL COULD BE DONE IN TWELVE EUROS FIFTY
HMM
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M BEING QUITE SERIOUS WHEN I SAY THAT THAT UM THE THINGS I MENTIONED ARE HOT
BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING MIGHT BE TO CHOOSE ONE
YOU KNOW IF IF WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS IS UM SOME OF THESE THINGS AREN'T JUST F AREN'T FEASIBLE
MAYBE WE COULD SOMETHING ABOUT NAMING WE COULD CALL IT YOU KNOW BLACKBERRY
THAT'S UH
ALRIGHT WELL LET'S SEE THEN
YEAH
YEAH
BUT YEAH I'M TRYING TO STREAMLINE MINE A LITTLE BIT
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
MM
THANK YOU KATE
MM
OH I THINK UM
FLORENCE RESOLVED IT BY
F. EIGHT AGAIN
MAYBE
MM
HMM
IT'S A DUPLICATION
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
TO UH M MAKE IT
OH NICE
UM HMM
MM
WOW
DO YOU THINK WITH UM
IT SEEMS THAT THAT UH YOU GUYS ARE QUITE KEEN ON THE PLASTIC PERHAPS THE SOMETHING REMINISCENT OF THE CHILD'S REMOTE
DO YOU THINK WE COULD PUT IT IN A IN A FRUIT COLOUR
AND HAVE IT ABSTRACT
YOU KNOW WE COULD CALL LIKE A FRUIT NAME BUT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE ABSTRACT
MM-HMM
I'M JUST JUST THROWING OUT IDEAS
YEAH
I'M THINKING MAYBE WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABSTRACT IF THE
DESIGN CONSTRAINTS ARE SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NICE
GOOD POINT
I'VE USED KINETIC IN TERMS OF WATCHES AND IT'S VERY VERY UH HANDY YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE
UM THAT IT'S THERE
IT'S
MM-HMM
IT COULD TIE IN WITH THE FANCIFUL DESIGN AS UH YOU KNOW THROW THE BANANA YOU KNOW JUST GOTTA KEEP IT MOVING
BE
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT I COULD MARKET THAT AS A UM AS A A I WAS THINKING ACTUALLY A A COST SAVER DOWN THE ROAD IN TERMS OF BATTERY YOU KNOW
MM-HMM
YOU KNOW KIND OF THE
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING
I'M SOLD
MM
KIND OF LIKE AN INTERNAL EGG
YEAH
AND WITH SPORTS ON TELEVISION
YOU KNOW
I SU
THEN I'LL JUST SAY I SUPPORT EITHER FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW I SUPPORT EITHER DECISION THAT THE DESIGNERS MAKE ON THAT
NO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY
THAT'S WHY I WAS LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER
MM
SOUNDS GOOD
THAT'S REALLY ALL I GOT GUYS
UM ALMOST THERE'S ONE MORE THING I HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ATTACHMENT WILL OPEN
AH HA
OKAY
WE'LL OPEN THAT WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
IN THE MEANTIME
CLOSING THINGS DOWN OKAY
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS THING DOES
DOES IT COME UP TOGETHER OR DISAPPEAR ONE OF THEM OR WHAT
AH WE CAME UP TOGETHER WE'RE GOOD
OKAY
ARE WE READY TO START
OKAY
IT'S NOW QUARTER OF FOUR
THIS IS A F ANOTHER FORTY MINUTE ONE SO IT WILL END AT FOUR TWENTY FIVE
OKAY
RIGHT
OUR AGENDA IS AS BEFORE FOR ME TO OPEN THE MEETING FOR US TO GO OVER THE PREVIOUS MINUTES
THEN FOR THE TWO OF YOU TO PRESENT YOUR PROTOTYPE AND FOR YOU TO G UM SARAH PRESENT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA
WE THEN HAVE A FINANCE ASPECT WHICH IS A SPREADSHEET AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ALL THINKING OF OH MY
UM BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY GIVEN A FORTY MINUTE TIME PERIOD TO GET IT ALL IN INCLUDING THE PRODUCTION EVALUATION
SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A VERY FAST TRACK
OKAY
UM AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S WHAT WE DO NEXT ON THIS THING
SO THE FIRST THING I HAVE TO DO IS CLOSE THIS SO THAT I CAN GET TO
WHERE IS IT
I NEED TO OPEN MINE
NOT THE AGENDA
NO THAT TH I WANT THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MINUTES
THAT SHOULD BE THERE MINUTES
YEAH
OKAY
UH FROM MEETING THREE IS IT ALRIGHT WITH YOU IF I DON'T SWITCH IT TO SHOW JUST USE IT AS IS
'CAUSE THIS WAY I CAN MORE EASILY FLIP IT
OKAY UM OBVIOUSLY ALL OF US WERE HERE FOR THE LAST MEETING WE REVIEWED THE PREVIOUS MINUTES BEFORE THAT UM EACH OF YOU MADE YOUR PRESENTATIONS
UM WE DISCUSSED THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES BASED ON WHAT WAS PRESENTED IN THOSE PRESENTATIONS
THE MARKET TREND OF FRUIT AND VEG MM SPONGY UH FANCY AND ELEGANT MORE THAN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE AND THAT MORE THAN EASY
UM WE DECIDED CHIP ON PRINT WOULD BE USED
UM WE WOULD USE PLASTIC WITH A RUBBER CASING I THINK WAS THE CONSENSUS POWERED BY KINETIC ENERGY
THERE WAS NO DECISION MADE ON THE CURVATURES OR DOUBLE CURVATURE OR STRAIGHT
UM PERHAPS THE PROTOTYPE WILL GIVE US AN INKLING OF THAT
UM LOOKING LIKE A SCROLL BUT IT'S REALLY A PUSH BUTTON TECHNOLOGY EXCUSE MY SPELLING
UM THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN USE
THAT IS UH BEHIND THE SCENES IS PUSH BUTTON WHICH WE UH ACCORDING TO KATE HAVE A VERY GOOD UH GRASP ON DOING THAT IN PRODUCTION
UM WE DECIDED THAT SEPARATE FASHIONABLE COVERS COVERING YOUR FRUIT AND VEG MIGHT BE A SEPARATE PRODUCT THAT COULD BE SUGGESTED TO MANAGEMENT
UM AND AS SUGGESTED UM YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS WITH THE COMPANY LOGO
A SLOGAN AND IMAGE MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO US
UM WE DID HAVE A FEW PRODUCTION ISSUES AND COORDINATION OF THE VARIOUS BITS AND WE HAD SOME CONFLICT OF IDEAS AND COST CONSTRAINTS AND WE RAN OUT OF TIME
UM WE HAD TO FOLLOW THAT UP AND PREPARE FOR THE LAST ONE
AND UH WE CLOSED AS IT RAN OUT OF TIME
IS THAT A FAIR PRESENTATION OF WHAT HAPPENED
OKAY BACK TO THIS MEETING
UM WE'RE DOWN TO THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
OVER TO YOU
OOH TWO
AH
UH-HUH
'KAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH I SEE THE ON OFF'S IN THE BACK
AND THEN YOU CAN USE YOUR THUMB
I COULD SEE THIS THING UNLESS IT'S REINFORCED HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE
YOU KNOW YEAH
HMM
OKAY
THE NEXT ITEM IS EVALUATION
UH IF THAT'S IF YOU'RE FINISHED
OH SORRY
TRY AGAIN
HMM
WELL WE WILL SOON UNFORTUNATELY
COME ON
NO
ELEGANT
ELEGANT
MM
YEAH
THE CHUNK
I THINK BETWEEN THE TWO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TWO IS TRUE
IT'S MORE TRUE THAN FALSE ABOUT A TWO
MM-HMM
TRENDY
MM-HMM
HMM
EXCESS BUTTONS
NO
BETTER MORE INTUITIVE BUTTONS YES
NO
I LIKE IT
MM-HMM
YES THE INSTINCT SAYS TRUE
YEAH THAT'S NOT A CHEAP THING TO GET
HMM
I THINK WE'RE GOOD
OKAY
WE'RE A LITTLE OVER HALFWAY THROUGH THE MEETING AND THE NEXT BIG THING IS THE FINANCE
OKAY
YEP
RIGHT
RIGHT
AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT SAYS THE SAME THING IT HAD NOT LOST ITSELF THANK GOODNESS
AND WE'RE GOING TO RAISE WHAT'S CALLED A SP A SPREADSHEET THAT THEY PROVIDED TO ME
UM
AND
IT SAYS FILL IN THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS YOU PLAN TO USE IN YOUR DEVICE
HAND DYNAMO BATTERY KINETIC SOLAR CELLS
OKAY
YEAH
UM
WHAT'S A HAND DYNAMO
OH SHOOT FORGET THAT
KINETIC IS UM AND HOW MANY OF THOSE WILL WE NEED PER WE ONLY NEED ONE
OKAY
ELECTRONIC SIMPLE CHIP ON PRINT AND WE'LL NEED ONE OF THOSE
OKAY AND WE ONLY NEED ONE OF THOSE
OKAY THE CASE WILL BE UNCURVED AND FLAT OR A SINGLE CURVE OR A DOUBLE CURVE
IT LOOKS LIKE IT SINGLE CURVE 'CAUSE OF TH THE CHUNKINESS
IT'S THAT'S UH UH ONE
AND THAT'S
UH THAT'S THE THE ONE THAT GOES LIKE THIS
RIGHT
NO SINGLE CURVE
OKAY CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENTS
PLASTIC WOOD RUBBER TITANIUM SPECIAL COLOUR
WE HAD THE SPECIAL COLOUR
AND DID WE SAY PLASTIC
YEAH
OKAY
WE'LL COME BACK IF WE CAN TO THE RUBBER BEING ADDED AT THE MOMENT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE
INTERFACE BUTTON PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE USING ISN'T IT
WHOOPS DON'T WANT THAT NOT YET
UM
NO IT JUST SAYS PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE
BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS THEY'LL BE IN A SPECIAL COLOUR OF BLACK
AND THE BUTTONS
WHA WHAT IS THE BUTTONS MADE OF RUBBER
SO WE NEED ONE OF THEM
AND ARE THEY ANY SPECIAL FORM
'CAUSE THE RATE WE'RE GOING WE CAN PUT THE RUBBER ON TOP
OH
OKAY
UM
LET'S PUT THAT RUBBER IN THEN OF THE CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENT
UH WE ONLY NEED ONE OF THEM
UM AND THE TOTAL COST HAS BEEN CALCULATED AS NINE POUNDS TWENTY OUT OF THE TWELVE AND A HALF WE WERE ALLOWED
WE'RE IN
THAT'S US
OKAY I'M GOING TO SAVE THIS INTO OUR
DESKTOP PROJECT DOCUMENTS
OKAY
AS OUR PROJECT DOCUMENT BIT
YEAH
THERE WE ARE
THAT'S THE ONLY EXCEL DOCUMENT THAT WILL BE IN THERE SO IT'S THERE FOR ALL OF US
OKAY SO ARE THEY UNDER TWELVE FIFTY
YES GO TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION NEXT SLIDE
RIGHT
UM THE PROJECT PROCESS SATISFACTION WITH FOR EXAMPLE THE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
YEAH LEADERSHIP
TEAMWORK
MEANS OF HAVING WHITEBOARD THE DIGITAL PENS AND ALL THAT KIND OF GOOD THINGS
UH-HUH
OKAY
SO WE WENT OVER ALL THOSE THINGS AND WE'RE SATISFIED WITH ALL THE ABOVE
UM DID WE FIND ANY NEW IDEAS
SO WE ACTUALLY WORKED WELL AS A GROUP
RIGHT
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET
YES
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
YES
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
AND WE'VE THEREFORE WE HAVE TO DO THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND DO THE MEETING SUMMARY I HAVE A FINAL REPORT TO PRESENT UM AND THEN WE'RE DONE
WE DONE GOOD AND WE'RE FINISHED IN TIME
I BELIEVE THAT IS THE END OF OUR MEETING
THANK YOU MELISSA
I KEEP FORGETTING WHETHER I'VE DONE THIS
YEP
TA DA
RIGHT
MM-HMM
UM WELL I DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH TO ADD
UM THE THE CASE OOPS THAT'S THE UH ON OFF BUTTON JUST COME OFF OUR PROTOTYPE
THE THE CASE CAN BE EITHER UM SPONGY RUBBER OR HARD PLASTIC
WE'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE ABOUT A COMBINATION OF THE TWO BUT IT CAN BE EITHER OF THOSE
WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT
UM AND AS FOR THE THE ACTUAL COMPONENTS UM UH STEPH JUST SAID THIS IS A QUITE A CHEAP DEVICE TO MANUFACTURE
WE HAVE SIMPLE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS UM WHICH PROVIDE ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY WE NEED
UM THE UM THE DIODE THAT ACTUALLY DOES THE UM INFRARED IS AT THE END
IT'S THE STALK OF THE BANANA OR IT'S JUST THE THING AT THE END OF THIS VERSION
UM SO THAT'S FOR MATERIAL
COLOUR WELL UH STEPH'S THE EXPERT ON COLOUR
UM WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR RESTRICTIONS ON THAT
YEAH I THINK THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT TO SAY REALLY
A BANANA
WOULD YOU CARE TO EXAMINE THE PROTOTYPES SEE HOW THEY FEEL IN THE HAND
YES THAT'S SO THAT YOUR INDEX FINGER AUTOMATICALLY GOES STRAIGHT TO IT
AND IT WAS PARTLY WE THOUGHT THE DESIGN LOOKED BETTER
BUT IT COULD BE MOVED IF IF MARKETING FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE ON OFF BUTTON IN A DIFFERENT PLACE
HMM
AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE DESIGN THERE'S NOT A LOT TO WRONG THE COMPONENTS ARE CHEAP TO MAKE
MM-HMM
YES A PLAIN SIMPLE CLEAN DESIGN
WELL WE HAVE GOT S TRENDY FURTHER DOWN BUT
ELEGANT I DON'T KNOW IF I'D CALL THEM ELEGANT
STYLISH YEAH
YEAH I'D
I D I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AIMING AT WITH THIS CONCEPT
I THINK WE'RE USING SIMPLE COMPONENTS THAT ARE GONNA BE ROBUST BUT NOT PARTICULARLY INNOVATIVE
VERY
YEAH
WE HAVE THE WORRY ABOUT HOW ROBUST IT WILL BE IF IT'S IT'S CURVED AS A BANANA BUT SPONGY
I THINK YEAH
YEAH
NO
SO THAT'S FALSE
NO
YEAH I THINK THEY'RE DIFFERENT AREN'T THEY
MM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK OUR INSTINCT IS THAT IT SHOULD BE PRETTY CHEAP TO DEVELOP
WE HAVEN'T GOT A LOT OF EXPENSIVE COMPONENTS IN THERE
I'D PUT IT AT ONE I THINK BUT I DUNNO WHAT DO YOU
YEAH TRUE IT MIGHT BE THE YEAH YEAH TRUE
TRUE
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT
RIGHT
YEAH
THAT WAS THE CRANK WIND UP CRANK ON THE SIDE
JUST ONE
UH UH YEAH I THINK WE CAN DO IT ALL WITH SIMPLE
JUST CHECKING THAT
YEAH SIMPLE 'CAUSE WE'VE JUST GOT PUSH BUTTONS SO WE CAN DO IT ALL WITH SIMPLE WHICH IS THE CH SHOULD BE THE CHEAPEST
YEP
YEAH THAT THAT ONE IS SINGLE CURVE ISN'T IT
UM DO WE HAVE
I I THINK YOU IT MEANS YOU REVERSE THE CURVE
YEAH
YEAH I DO I DON'T THINK WE NEED THAT FOR EITHER OF THEM YOU CAN DO A BANANA IN SINGLE CURVE YEAH
YEAH CAN WE DO SOME WHAT IFS 'CAUSE IT MAY I MEAN I I STILL QUITE LIKE THE IDEA OF COMBINING PLASTIC AND RUBBER MYSELF
BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE COST I GUESS
YES
YEP
DO WE NEED TO SAY HOW MANY BUTTONS OR
OR D IS IT JUST ONE
'KAY
UH THEY'LL BE RUBBER YEP
ACTUALLY DOES THA DOES SPECIAL MATERIAL MEAN THAT PLASTIC IS NOT A SPECIAL MATERIAL
'CAUSE I THINK THEY CAN BE PLASTIC
YEAH
THEY COULD BE PLASTIC WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT A DOUBLE CURVED CASE
IT'S JUST ONE ISN'T IT
WHAT WE'RE IN
MORE PROFIT
DO YOU DO YOU NEED TO DOUBLE CLICK ON THAT TO OPEN IT
YEAH YEAH THE PLAY DOH WAS BEST I THOUGHT
YEP
YEAH
YEAH I THINK WE'RE A GOOD TEAM ACTUALLY
I'M NOT SURE ALL THE WIRES ARE REALLY GREAT THOUGH
I THOUGHT SO
YES
YES
OH HANG ON WE HAVEN'T HEARD
MM-HMM
ABSOLUTELY AND IT'S KEPT US WITHIN BUDGET
AND THEN WE GET THE PRODUCT LAUNCH PARTY
PRODUCT LAUNCH PARTY
ABSOLUTELY
YES
ALRIGHT
WELL
YEAH WELL YOU SEE EACH MADE ONE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH YELLOW DOUGH
THIS IS THE ONE
THAT I MADE
IT IS UH CURVED EASY TO HOLD HAND HELD NICE AND SMALL WITH BIG EASY BUTTONS
THIS IS
LIKE A SCROLL BUT THEY ARE PUSH BUTTONS AND THEY ENTER TAKES YOU INTO THE DIFFERENT MENUS
OF COURSE WE NEED SOMEONE WHO'S EXPERIENCED WITH THE TELEVISION
I MEAN THIS IS THE INFRARED THING THAT'S GONNA ZAP AT THE TELEVISION
UH I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO MAKE THAT BUT I'M SURE IT WILL WORK
UH THIS IS ON OFF SWITCH 'CAUSE I THINK WE DO NEED THAT AND I THINK IT GIVES IT A NICE BALANCE
AND IT'S GONNA HAVE THE LOGO IMPRINTED ON IT UH IN THERE
UM AS FOR WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY MADE OF WELL THE FUNCTION OF THESE BUTTONS IS UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT IN THE DIFFERENT MENUS
UH POSITION I PRESUME THAT JUST MEANS
RIGHT RIGHT ON IT EASY TO SEE
THE MAIN FEATURE OF IT IS JUST A SIMPLE DESIGN SIMPLE LACK OF UH BUTTONS ALL OVER THE PLACE
RIGHT
FORM
CURVED KIND OF SMOOTH HAND HELD MAKES IT FEEL NICE TO HOLD
UH MATERIAL I THINK KATE'S GONNA TACKLE THAT QUITE A BIT BUT I THINK WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS
BECAUSE WE DID MAKE A ANOTHER ONE WHICH WA UH IS IN THE SHAPE OF BANANA IT'S JUST IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS AS YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS
LIKE JUST LIKE THIS BUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BANANA
WHICH IS ALSO NICE AND EASY TO HOLD AND FEELS GOOD AND HAS A SIMILAR SORT OF SCROLL PUSH BUTTON TECHNOLOGY
JUST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DESIGN
ALSO WITH ON OFF SWITCH AND INFRARED UH I HAD ENVISIONED IT IN HARD SMOOTH PLASTIC
SO LIKE UH WELL I DUNNO WHAT'S IT LIKE
I GUESS LIKE AN EXISTING REMOTE CONTROL BUT MOLDED AND SMOOTH
WHEREAS OTHERWISE WE'D THOUGHT LIKE WITH THIS ONE OR MIX AND MATCH
JUST WE WERE GONNA SEE WHAT YOU THOUGHT THE UH A MORE SPONGY RUBBER COVER WITH SPONGY BUTTONS
SO WE HAVE THE TWO OPTIONS WE CAN FOLLOW EITHER THE SMOOTH HARD PLASTIC OR THE SPONGY RUBBER DEPENDING ON COST RESTRAINTS
AND WHAT WE
WELL WHAT CONCLUSION WE REACH WHEN WE DISCUSS IT
UH MATERIAL YEAH THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT MATERIAL
CAN I SCROLL DOWN ON THERE AND SEE WHAT ELSE
WELL COLOUR I THINK I DEFINITELY HAVE A PREFERENCE TOWARDS BRIGHT YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS
BECAUSE THAT'S THE COMPANY COLOURS BUT IF ANYBODY'S GOT ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS I'M QUITE WILLING TO CONSIDER THEM AS WELL
SO IT JUST DEPENDS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THESE IDEAS AND IF I'M YEAH MAYBE KATE YOU BETTER SAY WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THEM
I THIN AS FOR AS FOR THE FRUIT OR ORGANIC THEME I GUESS THIS ONE IS OBVIOUSLY FRUIT SHAPED
THIS ONE HAS N BANANA YEAH
THIS ONE HAS NO OBVIOUS CONNECTIONS TO FRUIT BUT BECAUSE IT'S ROUND AND MOLDED
IT KINDA MAKES YOU THINK SORT OF ORGANIC TOUCHY FEELY KIDDIE IT'S MORE LIKE YEAH
YOU'D EXPECT IT TO BE LIKE A CHILD'S SORTA TOY REMOTE CONTROL INSTEAD OF A REAL ONE WHICH I QUITE LIKE THAT SORT OF IMAGE
'CAUSE IT'S VERY BIG AND CHUNKY AND CHILD FRIENDLY AND
HOLD THEM YOU SEE YOU KNOW
CURVATURE IS IT TO YOUR LIKING
IF YOU DON'T WANNA TIRE OUT YOUR THUMBS AFTER ALL
YEAH
BREAKING OH RIGHT
WELL YOU SEE THAT'S WHY HARD PLASTIC WOULD BE QUITE A GOOD THING FOR IT BECAUSE THEN IT'D JUST BE RIGID
YEAH WE REALLY LIKE WE REALLY LIKE THAT DESIGN I MEAN IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A LOGO THAT ARRANGEMENT OF THE KEYS
LIKE A C LIKE A COMPASS POINT YOU KNOW JUST UP
DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT AND WE THINK WE COULD MAKE THAT QUITE A GOOD FEATURE
AND IT'S LIKE THE THE IPOD SCROLL WHEEL BUT BETTER
YEAH
YEAH YEAH I MEAN IT THAT'S WHAT IT MAKES ME THINK OF MOBILE PHONES
I WAS TRY I WAS THINKING MOVING YOUR THUMB LIKE THIS WHAT DOES THAT REMIND ME OF
IT'S TEXTING
HMM
YEAH
I MEAN THE THING IS WE DO NEED TO DEVELOP OUR TECHNOLOGY OF I MEAN ACTUALLY HOW TO PROGRAM THE MENUS AND WHAT SORT OF
YOU KNOW TEXT BOX IS GONNA APPEAR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN BUT WE DO DEFINITELY THINK THAT IT'S A VIABLE OPTION
UH YEAH WE'RE FINISHED
YEAH WHAT ABOUT PRICE IS THAT GONNA GO ON THERE AS WELL
PRICE OF MATERIALS
NOT THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT WE CAN WE CAN PRETEND
IT DEPENDS WHAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY FANCY REALLY 'CAUSE WHEN I THINK OF FANCY
I THINK OF IT'S GOT LOTS OF EXTRA SORT OF FRIPPERIES AND YOU KNOW LIKE
BAROQUE CURLINESS AND WHICH
I'D CALL THESE QUITE UH MINIMALIST
SIMPLE AND PLAIN BUT I MEAN I DO SEE WHAT IT IS HEAVILY RELIANT ON APPEARANCE INSTEAD OF PURE FUNCTIONALITY SO IN THAT RESPECT IT IS QUITE FANCY
I THINK JUST MAYBE WE NEED A DIFFERENT WORD OTHER THAN FANCY I'D SAY MAYBE AESTHETIC
LIKE STYLISH OR AESTHETIC
FANCY
DID YOU JUST BREAK THE PEN
WELL D WE'LL JUST CALL IT FANCY THEN
YEAH I THINK WE N WE NEED TO THEY'RE BOTH YELLOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS IT'S JUST THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MORE DOUGH TO REPRESENT UH THAT
BUT IF YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE BANANA SHAPE WITH THESE BITS AS BLACK
SO WHAT WE RE REALLY NEED TO DECIDE IS WHETHER WE WANT THE ACTUAL BANANA SHAPE
OR JUST A A PURELY BLOB OR SOME SORT OF ABSTRACTION IN BETWEEN THE TWO THAT ISN'T THAT IS MORE CURVED
LIKE A BANANA BUT THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY RECOGNISABLE AS A BANANA YOU KNOW WITH THE GROOVES AND THE STALK AND STUFF SO
SO THAT'S MAYBE NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE JUST RIGHT NOW IS IT
JUST SOMEWHERE A LONG THE SCALE OF IN BETWEEN THESE TWO
YES
OH YES
WELL MAYBE ONLY A TWO OR A THREE THEN 'CAUSE IT'S NO WE STILL HAVEN'T DECIDED ABOUT SPECIFIC SPONGINESS OR SPECIFIC
YEAH I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT'S GONNA WORK BUT
NO
NO
WELL IT IS QUITE IT IS QUITE QUIRKY I THINK
IT COULD BE QUITE A GOOD BRAND LIKE
A GOOD LITTLE OBJECT
OH WE ALSO NEED THO THINK ABOUT THE ENERGY
IS IT THE KINETIC ENERGY
IF IT'S IT IS GONNA BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WITH THE KINETIC ENERGY
YEAH BUT WE HAVEN'T
COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THAT SIDE OF IT YET SO WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY SURE ABOUT THAT BUT YEAH
YEAH
I WOULD SAY MAYBE A TWO 'CAUSE WE STILL WE NEED TO UH GET SOMEBODY IN WHO IS GOOD WITH THE PROGRAMMING FOR THE MENUS
AND THINGS
I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST LIKE I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE EV YOU KNOW ON A NORMAL CHUNKY REMOTE EVERY BUTTON RES I MEAN MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT
WHEREAS THIS ONE HAS ONLY GOT THE FOUR BUTTONS AND THEY ALL THEY MEAN EVERYTHING DEPENDING ON WHAT MENU YOU'RE IN
UH WE NEED SOMEBODY TO DEVELOP THAT
YEAH
JUST PUTTING NO EXCESS BUTTONS
AS FOR SEE IF WE'RE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE I'D SAY IT IS QUITE INNOVATIVE
BECAUSE THERE AREN'T REALLY MANY THAT HAVE THIS MENU IDEA INSTEAD OF ALL THE EXTRA BUTTONS
I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING INVOLVING INTERNET OR SPEECH RECOGNITION
BUT BUT WE ARE AT THE UPPER END OF THE PUSH BUTTON MARKET
WELL JUST KINETIC THEN
IT'S THE WIND UP
WHAT DOES DOUBLE CURVED MEAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND
OH NO WE DON'T NEED THAT
NO
SINGLE CURVED I'D SAY
I
I JUST WANNA SAY PLASTIC
IT'S JUST BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH
WELL YEAH LIKE THE COMPASS POINT ONE
YEAH THEY COULD BE PLASTIC
GREAT
YES
YEAH
AND PLAY DOH
YEAH WELL 'CAUSE I MEAN IT'S SO HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU MEAN JUST WITH WORDS AND POINTING AT PHOTOGRAPHS AND SAYING
WELL WE QUITE WANT THIS BUT IMAGINE IT ROUNDER
SO MUCH BETTER JUST TO GO AND
YOU KNOW THIS IS IT THIS IS WHAT WE WANT
YEAH
SPONGY
AND I'D NEVER HEARD OF THE KINETIC ENERGY BEFORE SO
GOOD WORK AS A DESIGN TEAM BECAUSE WE
OH YES
YES
YEAH
AND THE THE ONLY FALSE ONE IS BECAUSE WE'VE CHOSEN
TO KEEP A SIMPLE OLD TECHNOLOGY WHICH IF IT WORKS PERFECTLY WELL I SEE NO POINT IN IMPROVING ON IF IT WORKS SO
YEAH
SO WE DO COUNT AS I THINK EXCELLENT OR ONE
BRING ON THE ICE SCULPTURES
YEAH
THAT'S WHAT I SAID ICE SCULPTURES
IS THAT THE END OF THE MEETING
RED
AGENDA THREE
MM
I LIKE THE FACT THAT ON BOTH OF THEM THE KEYS PLAY SUCH A PROMINENT ROLE
IT'S REALLY KIND OF A
MM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT IT'S ALSO LIKE TEXTING YOU DON'T
YEAH
IT'S ALSO IN TERMS OF UM BEING LOST IT'S IT'S QUITE IT LOOKS QUITE DIFFERENT
YOU KNOW I I D I HAVE SEVERAL FOUR REMOTES
AND THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME UNTIL YOU GET UP CLOSE AND YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW THIS IS REALLY IDENTIFIABLE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO OKAY
UM
SHALL I TAKE YOUR UH POWER
OH
OKAY
THIS IS GOING TO BE A HEAVILY INTERACTIVE EVALUATION
AND THE METHOD HERE IS TO EVALUATE THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL IN TERMS OF THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND THE HOT TRENDS INTRODUCED BY THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT
SO THIS MEANS WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER THE PRIORITIES THAT WERE RAISED BY UH THE CONSUMERS
A AS WELL AS INCORPORATE ALL OF OUR INSIGHT INTO THIS UH EVALUATION EXERCISE
SO I'M GOING TO GO AND USE THE WHITEBOARD AND I'VE MADE A LIST OF CRITERIA TO LOOK AT
AND SO I'M GONNA I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS UP AS THE LAST THING
BUT FOR THE EVALUATION IT'S GOING TO BE ONE IS TRUE AND SEVEN IS FALSE GOING OVER THESE DIFFERENT CRITERIA
SO ONE TRUE SEVEN FALSE AND I'M GONNA NOW USE THE UM THE BOARD
OKAY
SO UM
FANCY
TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
EASY TO USE TRENDY
BUTTONS
EXCESS BUTTONS GOOD BUTTONS
UGLY
SELLABLE
AND OTHER
AND IN FACT I HOPE THAT UH YOU ALL INTRODUCE SOME ADDITIONAL TERMS
BECAUSE THESE ARE THINGS THAT UM HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP SOME OF THEM SEEM RATHER CLOSE LIKE THEY OVERLAP
MM YEAH PRICE
WE'LL PUT PRICE UP AT THE TOP
UM
OKAY SO
DID YOU SAY
UH OKAY SO
WHA HOW DO WE FEEL IN TERMS OF IS THIS FANCY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I YEAH SO IN THAT RESPECT I THINK WE'LL GO WITH THAT RESPECT
YEAH
ELEGANT
YEAH NO THESE AREN'T THE EXACT TERMS THAT THE UM
YEAH
ELEGANT
WE'RE GON LET'S USE ELEGANT ALTHOUGH THE THE THE PEOPLE THE WORD ON THE STREET IS IS
YEAH
N THAT UM
YEAH UH THE UH IS FANCY
SO LET'S LET'S TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
WELL OKAY SO IN TERMS OF ELEGANT FANCY
WE'LL CALL IT E. F. UM DO WE DO WE THINK THAT PERHAPS AND MAYBE WE SHOULD SAY THE YELLOW
SHOULD WE GO WITH THE YELLOW IN TERMS OF I THINK THAT'S A REALLY SUPERIOR THEY'RE BOTH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AS A BANANA
I THINK THAT MANY OF US ARE ABSTRACT ENOUGH TO LOOK AT THE YELLOW ONE AND SAY WE'LL CALL IT THE BANANA
AND OF THE TWO I REALLY LIKE I M I LIKE THE BANANA BUT I I DO LIKE THE CHUNK
NO BUT I MEAN IN TERMS WE HAVE TO EVALUATE ONE OF THEM
UNLESS DO YOU GUYS WANNA EVALUATE BOTH
OKAY
SO WE SAY TRUE
UM
TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
YEAH
SO WE'LL SAY WE'LL SAY UH FALSE
EASY TO USE
ONE IS THAT INAPPROPRIATE
OKAY
OH PARDON ME
UM
TRENDY S AND I SAY SPECIFICALLY SPONGY FRUITY
OKAY
OKAY SO TWO
UM
ARE THERE EXCESS BUTTONS
THAT IS FALSE
UM GOOD WELL DESIGNED BUTTONS INTUITIVE BUTTONS
TRUE
UGLY
PEOPLE DON'T RESPOND WELL TO UGLY
SELLABLE UH QUIRKY YOU KNOW SOMETHING PEOPLE LIKE OH YEAH
YEAH I DO TOO
OH YEAH
AND I WAS I WAS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS UM IN TERMS OF UH COULD WE SAY IT'S COST SAVING
WITH THE
YEAH WITH THE ENERGY
IT IS GOING TO BE KINETIC
YEAH WE'LL C WE'LL SAY IT'S A COST SAVING ENVIRO
UH SO YES
WELL YOU'RE STILL IN THE PLAY DOH STAGE
ANYTHING ELSE
INCLUDING PRICE DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT PRICE OR OTHER FEATURES
OKAY
SO TRUE ONE OR SHOULD I GO TO TWO OR THREE
OKAY
UM
OTHER
ANYTHING ELSE YOU GUYS CAN THING OF
AND I'M GONNA ACTUALLY CHANGE A COUPLE OF THESE SO THEN I'M GONNA INSTEAD OF UGLY I'M GONNA SAY IT'S ATTRACTIVE AND THEN MAKE THAT TRUE
SO THAT 'CAUSE I HAVE TO DO AN AVERAGE
AND THEN UM EXCESS BUTTONS
EXACTLY
WOW WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL
YEAH BE YOU KNOW SO IT DOESN'T RUIN THE POLARITY
MM-HMM
OR L. C. D.
YEAH
WELL IF YOU G UH LET ME KNOW IF IF ANY OF THESE UM IF YOU IF YOU ALL CAN THINK OF ANY OTHER UM THING TO CHANGE HERE IF YOU TH IF YOU THINK I SHOULD CHANGE THE INNOVATIVE OR ADD OTHER FEATURES
IF NOT I'LL AVERAGE THOSE
OKAY
MM
SO
UM OKAY HOW ABOUT IF I UH PASS THIS BACK TO YOU AND I'LL UH FIGURE OUT THE AVERAGE HERE
THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE'S HELP WITH THAT
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
YEAH
SURE
YES
YEAH
YEP
I THINK WITH THE MARKETING ELEMENT OF UH FRUIT SHAPED I I MEAN I THAT REALLY OPENED MY EYES
I I ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF THOUGH
YES
I CAN GIVE YOU A NUMBER UM IT'S UH THE AVERAGE EVALUATION SCORE IS ONE POINT EIGHT EIGHT
SO IT MEANS W YOU KNOW I CAN I CAN SPELL IT OUT
THERE WERE SIX TRUE OR ONES FOUR UM PARDON ME
TWO S ALMOST TRUE OR CLOSE TO TRUE SO THAT WAS FOUR POINTS
AND THEN UH ONE FALSE SEVEN POINTS SO SEVENTEEN DIVIDED BY NINE WE'RE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO
I WOULD SAY THAT'S EX EXCELLENT
IN TERMS OF UH HO HOW MUCH WE ADHERE TO THE IDEALS OF THE UH MARKET PLACE
TO MAINTAIN OLD TECHNOLOGY EXACTLY
YEAH YEAH
YES
OKAY
NICE
SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT
YEAH
UM I ONE THING I WANT TO DO IS OH I THINK THE MEETING'S DONE
YEAH
UM ONE THING I WA I WANNA DO IS SAVE EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT FILES BECAUSE I DON'T THINK EVERYTHING IS SAVED
THE RIGHT FILES
FINAL MEETING MARKET
RIGHT SO
START OF THE FIRST MEETING
UH
RIGHT SO AGENDA OF THE FIRST MEETING
WHERE WE UH
WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES FOR THIS MEETING
WE UH ARE TO GET ACQUAINTED
SO DOES EVERYONE WANT TO SAY WHO THEY ARE
THAT SEEM SENSIBLE
AND I'M ALASTAIR AND I'M THE PROJECT LEADER
ALRIGHT OKAY SO TOOL TRAINING
UM
PROJECT PLAN
SO DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY UH THOUGHTS
AS TO THE TOOL TRAINING THAT UH IS REQUIRED
NEITHER AM I
OH I SEE SO WE SHOULDN'T REALLY BE
OH RIGHT OKAY SO
SO WE HAVE THE PROJECT TEAM WHICH IS TO UM BASICALLY TO COME UP WITH A NEW R REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE
UH WE HAVE UH THE STARTING BASE WAS THE ORIGINAL WHICH HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE NOW FOR A PERIOD OF TIME
AND UH OUR IDEA IS TO UH
TO MAKE THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE UH MORE USER FRIENDLY THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE AND TO TO BE TRENDIER
TO BE WITH IT AND THEREFORE TO UH TO GET A BIGGER MARKET SHARE AND BIGGER AUDIENCE
SO UM METHOD OF DOING THIS IS UH SPLIT UP AS YOU CAN SEE INTO UH
THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THE CONCEPTIONAL DESIGN AND THE DETAILED DESIGN
SO UM
IN EACH OF THESE UH PHASES WE'LL UH BASICALLY BE HANDING OVER TO YOURSELVES THE DESIGNERS OF THIS UH
THIS DEVICE
AND UH HAVING UH MEETINGS SO THAT WE CAN UH DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY UM COME UP WITH A
BETTER BETTER INST IMPLEMENT THAN WE HAD BEFORE
AND THEREFORE UM HAVE A SUCCESSFUL UH CONCLUSION TO THE DAY
UM
AND YOU'LL BE DOING UH VARIOUS DESIGNS UH THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO MEET THIS END
SO WE'VE GOT TOOL TRAINING
TRY OUT WHITEBOARD
UH
SO WE WILL UM
RIGHT SO EVERYONE'S TO UH SUPPOSEDLY UH DRAW THEIR FAVOURITE ANIMAL OVER ON THE WHITE BOARD OVER THERE
I GUESS THIS IS UH MAKE SURE THE WHITEBOARD WORKS
SO UH I DON'T KNOW WHO WISHES TO GO FIRST
DO YOU WISH TO GO F HAVE A FIRST BASH AT UH WHATEVER
AH UH
BUT NOW YOU YOU UH YOU'LL MOVE OUT FROM THE MICROPHONE AND THE CAMERA
I TAKE IT THAT
I WOULD I WOULD GUESS SO
OR
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS
I MEAN YOU DESIGNERS ARE MEANT TO COME UP WITH THESE SORT OF THINGS
NEXT
I DON'T SEE AS THERE'S ANY NEED TO
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE
I MEAN WHATEVER
EXACTLY
WE'VE HAD MORE TIME TO PREPARE OVER THIS SIDE SO WE'VE ALL STUCK OUR BITS AND PIECES IN OUR POCKETS
THE THREE PENS ARE UNDERNEATH
YOU GET MARKS FOR ARTISTIC IMPRESSION
SO YOU'RE JUST DOING THE FACE
RIGHT UM
WELL I'VE NOT ACTUALLY HAD TOO MANY PETS UH OVER MY UH TIME 'CAUSE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU UH
I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON THEM ANYWAY
NOT TO WORRY
SO WHAT MY DAUGHTERS HAVE GOT AT THE MOMENT IS THEY'VE GOT UH A FEW FISH AND SO HOPEFULLY UM WON'T PROVE TOO DIFFICULT TO DRAW
UH
AS YOU CAN SEE THAT MY ARTIST ARTISTIC WORK IS USELESS AS WELL
ANYWAY UM
AND UH ONE OF THE BEST UH THINGS ABOUT FISH IS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY TAKE UH TOO MUCH LOOKING AFTER BECAUSE UH WITH MOST OF THE ANIMALS IF YOU'RE GOING AWAY ON HOLIDAY OR WHATEVER
YOU'VE GOTTA SPEND MONEY OR GET A FRIEND OR WHATEVER TO LOOK AFTER THEM FOR YOU
WHEREAS IF YOU GOT FISH
YOU JUST GOTTA PUT THE FOOD IN A A A DRIPPER FEED WHICH FEEDS THEM OVER THE UH COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT YOU'RE AWAY AND UH
CHANGE THE WATER EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AND BUY IN A FEW PLANTS SO
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY KEEP DYING UH FISH ARE UH ARE NOT ARE ARE ARE REASONABLE PETS IN THAT UH THEY'RE LOW MAINTENANCE
RIGHT
OKAY UH IF WE'RE STILL ALL WITH US
RIGHT OKAY SO
WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON UH
THIS UH PROJECT WHERE BY UM TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS UH THE UH EXPECTED UH SELLING PRICE
THAT INFORMATION HAS COME FROM OUR MARKETING MANAGER HERE
SO WE'RE LOOKING TO SELL INTERNATIONALLY NOT JUST IN EUROPE
WE'RE LOOKING AT UM HAVING OUR PRODUCTION COSTS LIMITED TO UH TWELVE AND AN HALF EURO PER UNIT
AND THEREFORE MAKING A PROFIT MARGIN OF UH WELL NOT ACTUALLY A PROFIT MARGIN IT'S UH BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE OVERHEADS AND VARIOUS OTHER COSTS TO UH TAKE UH FROM UH
FROM THAT TO GIVE YOU YOUR PROFIT MARGIN PER UNIT
AND SO DEPENDING WHAT THE UH THE OVERHEAD UH COSTS ARE WILL DETERMINE UH HOW MANY UNITS WE'RE UH LOOKING TO SELL OR PROJECTING TO SELL AT THIS POINT IN TIME
SO UM
EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROL FIRST IDEAS
NEW REMOTE
SO I GUESS WE'RE LOOKING AT UM HAVING A DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO HELP UH YOU UM FOLKS DESIGN OUR OUR NEW MODEL AS IT WERE
SO UH ANY ANY THOUGHTS
OKAY SO SO BASICALLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME UM WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DEVICE THAT IS UM ROBUST AND
AND THEREFORE UH WON'T GET DAMAGED TOO EASILY
UM WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DEVICE
THAT IS UH WHAT WAS THE OTHER THINGS YOU SAID THERE
EASY TO USE
USE
AND SEE
OKAY
UH
MM-HMM
OH I W UM BASICALLY I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME SENSIBLE 'CAUSE AS YOU RIGHTLY SAID THERE'S NOTHING MORE ANNOYING THAN HAVING THREE OR FOUR DEVICES LITTERED ABOUT THE UH ABOUT THE ROOM
AND UH
SO A DEVICE FOR
FOR ALL REMOTES
HMM
BUT IS IT IN A SENSE IT'S R UM MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH THE TH THE ONE DEVICE AND THEN HAVE FEW BUTTONS ON IT TO 'CAUSE YOU WANT YOU WANT SIMPLICITY AS WELL
YOU WANT ANY IDIOT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT
WHILST AT THE SAME TIME YOU WANT AS YOU RIGHTLY SAID ONE REMOTE FOR ALL
AND SO THESE ARE PROBABLY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OPTIONS THAT UH HMM YOU COULD ARGUE THAT EXPERIENCE OF USING DEVICES AND SIMILAR DEVICES AS PEOPLE GET MORE AND MORE USED TO USING REMOTES
THEREFORE THEY'RE MORE WITH HANDLING THEM THEREFORE YOU CAN MAKE THEM MORE COMPLICATED AS TIME GOES ON
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS
MM-HMM
OKAY
UM WELL WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE END OF THE MEETING
SO UH WE HAVE TO UH START WINDING UP
UM IS THERE NEXT MEETING IN THIRTY MINUTES
SO UM
RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT I. D. THE COME ON WHERE'S MY
OH THERE WE GO
YEAH
THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
RIGHT
SO WE'VE GOT FUNCTION
OH WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
RIGHT
RIGHT
SORRY ABOUT THAT
OKAY SO WE'VE GOT UM THE WORKING DESIGN
FOR I. D.
FOR U. I. D. THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
MARKETING THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSON BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
SO
ARE WE ALL CLEAR WHAT OBJECTIVES WE'RE LOOKING TO MEET IN THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES
AND I GUESS I'LL TRY AND WRITE UP SOME MINUTES OF UH THIS MEETING TO UH TO GIVE IT TO YOU FOR THE NEXT MEETING
TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S TRUE 'CAUSE DURING DURING THE COURSE OF OUR DAY WE MIGHT MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON INFORMATION OR MEETINGS THAT WOULD CHANGE WHERE WE'RE GOING
BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT UH SHALL WE MAKE IT JUST A T. V.
OKAY
SO WE WILL DEPART
WE WILL STAY HERE AND UH AND BREAK OFF
AND I'LL DO MINUTES AND AND WE'LL SEE YOU IN HALF AND HOUR
OKAY
RIGHT S
OKAY
I'M NICK
I AM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
TOOL TRAINING
YEAH
YES
OKAY
YOU'VE LOST UH YOUR MICROPHONE THERE
OKAY YEAH
I'LL I'LL
SHALL I SEE IF I CAN GET ACROSS WITHOUT JUST TANGLING EVERYTHING
OKAY
THERE'S ONE
DIDN'T THINK OF THAT
'KAY UH PENS ARE OVER HERE
I'LL TRY THE RED PEN
OKAY
UM
I'M GONNA GO FOR THE BEAR WHICH I'M BE ABLE TO DRAW VERY WELL BUT
I'LL HAVE A BASH AT IT
UH
OOH OOH I LOST IT THERE
I THINK I'VE JUST KNOCKED THE MICROPHONE
UM
WE'LL G THEN WE'LL GO FOR A A S SMALL SMALL BEAR
UM AND I LIKE MY ANIMAL THAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE A BEAR BECAUSE UM
I DUNNO MAYBE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY CARTOON CHARACTERS MADE UP AFTER THE BEAR LIKE THE JUNGLE BOOK CHARACTERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
GREAT
YES
UM I WITH SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THE BUTTONS WERE A LITTLE SMALL SO THEY'RE QUITE HARD TO PRESS SO MAYBE WE MAKE SOMETHING WITH UH
EASY TO PRESS BUTTONS
AS THAT IS THE MAIN FUNCTION
YES
UM SORT OF EASY TO USE SO THE BUTTONS ARE ACCESSIBLE
IS EASY TO USE AND SEE
YES
SORRY YOU GO
YOU GO
YEAH
YES
YEAH
MAYBE WE COULD UM HAVE BETTER INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE REMOTE
OR ARE WE JUST DOING THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF OR SORT OF THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WOULD COME WITH IT
'KAY
OR NOT
SLIDE FOUR
OKAY
YES
'KAY YES
I THINK YOU JUST SAID AT THE START IT WAS A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST STICK TO THAT UNLESS WE GET TOLD OTHERWISE
'KAY
OKAY THAT'S GREAT
I'M LOUISA
I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY TOOL TRAINING
I DON'T MIND
UM
LET'S SEE
GOOD JOB I GOT POCKETS TODAY
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW DO YOU THINK OR
OH
RIGHT HERE WE GO
OKAY
I THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS THE CAT
LITTLE SMILEY CAT THERE
UM AND THIS WOULD BE
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY INDEPENDENT UH THEY'RE VERY INTELLIGENT COMPARED TO DOGS MAYBE
UM AND THEY CAN BE VERY VERY AFFECTIONATE
SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK SO BUT I KNOW VERY AFFECTIONATE CATS
UM
UM AND THEY CAN LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES
SHALL I RUB THAT OUT ACTUALLY
THAT'S QUITE GOOD
CAN I JUST CHECK
IS THIS JUST A TELEVISION REMOTE
BECAUSE A LOT OF UM
SYSTEMS ARE KIND OF T. V. VIDEO COMBINED NOW OR T. V. D. V. D. COMBINED
AND ONE OF THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS IS HAVING LIKE FIVE REMOTES IN THE HOUSE
SO IF YOU'VE GOT A COMBINED SYSTEM IT COULD BE A COMBINED REMOTE
OR IS IT JUST A TELEVISION THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING
COMES TO YOUR WHISTLE
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE BACK TO THE START
UM IF YOU GRAB THE KIND OF UH SLIDE TO THE LEFT AND PULL IT DOWN
I'M NOT EXACTLY CLEAR ON WHAT WE'RE DESIGNING THE REM REMOTE FOR
IS THIS A MUN MULTI FUNCTIONAL ONE OR DO WE DECIDE THAT OURSELVES AS WE GO AWAY AND WORK ON IT
RIGHT
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
I'M ROBIN
I'M THE MARKETING MANAGER
MM-HMM OKAY
I DUNNO
YOUR MICROPHONE'S JUST
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
WE CAN HAVE HAVE A WHOLE MENAGERIE
RIGHT
HELLO
UM I'M GONNA GO FOR THE DOG AND I'M GONNA DRAW ONE BADLY AS WELL
UH
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A DACHSHUND OR SOMETHING
RIGHT
THERE'S MY DOG
UM I LIKE DOGS BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY LOYAL
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS HAPPY SO WHENEVER WHENEVER YOU'RE FEELING SORT OF A BIT A BIT DOWN OR TIRED THEY'RE ALWAYS COMING UP AND THEY'RE ALWAYS UM QUITE EXCITED
SO UM YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH A DOG
AND THEY'RE ALSO GOOD FOR EXERCISE AS WELL
YOU CAN SORTA GET OUT AND THEY THEY SORTA NEVER GET TIRED
AND AND WHEN THEY'RE TIRED THEY'RE QUITE CUTE AS WELL SO
OKAY THAT'S WHY I LIKE DOGS
GREAT
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I'VE
OKAY
YEAH
UM ONE OF THE THINGS UM WE FOUND FROM THE MARKET RESEARCH IS THAT PEOPLE OFTEN GET CONFUSED BY THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS ON THEM AS WELL
'CAUSE THERE'S QUITE OFTEN LOTS AND LOTS
AND UM SOMETIMES UH THEY SORT OF REMOTE CONTROLS DEFEAT THEIR OWN PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU'RE SAT IN THE CHAIR AND THE REMOTE IS SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE ROOM
SO WHEREAS IN THE PAST YOU'D HAVE TO GET UP TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL NOW YOU HAVE TO GET UP TO SORT OF PICK UP THE REMOTE
SO SO I DON'T WE NEED TO SORT OF MAYBE THINK ABOUT HOW UM WE COULD MAYBE UH DEVELOP A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH MOVES AROUND THE ROOM
I DON'T KNOW
THAT'S THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE WHEN YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR TELEVISION BUT
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
I MEAN
WE'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH UM ABOUT SORT OF YOU KNOW WHAT THE CUTTING EDGE SORT OF HAND HELD DEVICES ARE
AND A LOT OF THEM SORT OF USE YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIKE THEY'RE LIKE MINI LAPTOPS
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD DEVISE A SYSTEM WHERE WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY SORT OF HOLDING A A MINIATURE COMPUTER WHICH IS CONTROLLING ALL YOUR YOUR SORT OF YOUR TELEVISION
YOUR STEREO AND WHERE YOU KNOW IF YOU BUY A NEW THING THEN IT SORT OF YOU CAN LINK IT TO THAT AS WELL MAYBE
OKAY
IF YOU JUST CLICK RETURN IT SHOULD BE OKAY
IT'LL GET RID OF THE MESSAGE
IF YOU HIT JUST HIT RETURN AND IT SHOULD GET RID OF THE MESSAGE
OH YOU'VE GOT
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY COOL
OKAY CHEERS
RIGHT UH
SO UM
SO WHERE'S THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
SORRY
MICROSOFT POWERPOINT RIGHT
RIGHT OKAY
SO
RIGHT
OKAY SO WE'VE GOT UH
SO WE'VE GOT NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
UM
SO BASICALLY WE'VE GOT THREE THINGS AND WE'VE GOT FORTY MINUTES IN WHICH TO UH FOR THIS MEETING TO UH TO DISCUSS THE VARIOUS OPTIONS
UM
THREE PRESENTATIONS
I SEE RIGHT
THAT'S NICE TO KNOW ONE FROM EACH OF YOU
UM NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
UM SO DO WE WANT TO DO THE PRESENTATION FIRST OR DO WE WANT TO UM
W I I GOT UM OR OR THREE THINGS BASICALLY UM RELATING TO THE REMOTE BEING ONLY FOR T. V.
WE DISCUSSED THAT LAST TIME AND IN ACTUAL FACT THAT WAS PR PRETTY WELL WHAT WE CAME UP WITH ANYWAY
SO IN FACT IT ACTUALLY F WE WON'T BE FORESTALLED IN A SENSE
UM WE'VE GOT UH TELETEXT OUTDATED
UM DID YOU GET ANY INFORMATION ON THAT
RIGHT AND THE CORPORATE IMAGE WAS THE UH FINAL THING
SO I I GOT THAT IN EMAIL FORM
UM
RIGHT OKAY
SO
I GUESS IF WE GO AHEAD WITH THE UH WITH THE THREE PRESENTATIONS
SO WE'LL START WITH YOURSELF ON THE BASIS THAT UH
SORRY YEP
OH
IT GOING
OKAY
UH THERE'S THE RUBBER ON THE RIGHT I THINK
IT'S MAGIC
SO THE THE TOP BIT'S THE POWER SOURCE YES
SO THE BATTERY IS THE IN THE SENDER
OKAY
SO NOW MORE DESIGN
THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO HEAR
IS IT CONTROL FUNCTION EI OH TH THERE YOU GO
WELL THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE
UM WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN UM LOGO AND COLOUR SCHEME
SO BASICALLY WE'D HAVE TO UH WE'D HAVE TO BE PUTTING THAT ON UM THE THE PRODUCT
I HAVEN'T AS YET NO
BUT UH I GOT UH I GOT AN EMAIL THAT BASICALLY SAID TO UH MAKE SURE THAT UH WHATEVER DEVICE WE COME UP WITH AT THE END OF THE DAY HAD TO INCORPORATE UM THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN
SO UH I'M GUESSING THAT UH UH I NOTICE ON THE BOTTOM THERE IT'S GOT UH
WHAT'S THAT
A. P. O. G. E. E. THAT MIGHT BE THE CORPORATE COLOUR SCHEME ALTHOUGH THE ONLY THE ONLY COLOUR I CAN SEE IN THAT IS THE RED
WELL B UH W
WELL TH THE ON THE WELL UH FOR FOR GENERAL TELEVISION PURPOSES OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE CHANNELS ONE TO FIVE AT THIS POINT IN TIME
AND WE'D HAVE TO HAVE SOME ROOM FOR UH FUTURE SUCH CHANNELS
BUT BUT
BUT WELL POSSIBLY BUT THE THE OTHER THING IS THAT WITH UM THE CURRENT EXPANSION OF UH CHANNELS UH IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING PLACE
CERTAINLY THE BUTTON UP AND DOWN BUT UH I MEAN HOW MANY CHANNELS DO WE HAVE TO UM ACTUAL TELEVISION CHANNELS DO WE HAVE TO UH PREPARE FOR
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT UH
IT'S FOREVER EXPANDING AND AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT ALTHOUGH YOU'VE ONL YOU'VE GOT THE FIVE STANDARD
YOU'VE GOT THE B. B. C. HAVE COME UP WITH A FURTHER SIX AND UH THERE'S UH I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY CHANNELS THERE ARE ON UH WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT UH SKY AND VARIOUS OTHER UM VARIOUS OTHERS
SO I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULDN'T YOU KNOW RATHER OKAY
IF THE TIME OF FLICKING FROM ONE TO OTHER BUT PRESUMABLY IT'LL TAKE A SECOND 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STOP IT
MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE A FAST FORWARD ON THE ON THE CHANNELS THAT W AND THEN YOU COULD DISPENSE WITH MORE OTHERWISE
Y YOU'D WANT YOU'D WANT TO GET FAIRLY QUICKLY TO THE CHANNEL THAT YOU WANTED
MM-HMM
YEAH
I S I SUPPOSE IN A SENSE YOU COULD HAVE UM IF YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED CHANNELS THEN IF YOU HAD SORT OF AN EASY WAY OF GETTING RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO ONE TO A HUNDRED
YOU COULD GO ONE TO ONE TO TEN
TEN TO TWENTY AND THEN HAVE A SECOND BUTTON TO GET YOU TO THE ACTUAL CHANNEL YOU WANT AND THAT WOULD CUT DOWN YOUR TIME
ANYWAY
WHATEVER
OKAY
OKAY
LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS USER FRIENDLY
YEAH
WELL THAT'S TRUE YEAH YOU COULD GET FIFTY BY FIVE AND A ZERO OR WHATEVER THAT THAT MAKES SENSE
YEAH
DOES
SO W SO WHAT WAS THE CIRCULAR THING THAT YOU WERE
IF IT'S JUST FOR T. V. WHICH IS WHAT IT IS AT THE MOMENT
MM-HMM
WELL WE'VE WE'VE GOT UM THAT IT'S REMOTE FOR T. V. ONLY OTHERWISE PROJECT WOULD BECOME TOO COMPLEX WITH UH WHICH WOULD ENDANGER THE TIME TO MARKET WAS ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS
I'M I DON'T KNOW D DID YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION BEHIND THE MARKETING OR WAS I MEANT TO GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION
RIGHT
RIGHT OKAY SO BASICALLY TIME TO MARKET SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT THEREFORE SPEED OF DELIVERY
WE'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT ANOTHER FOUR HOURS LEFT
YEAH I THINK SHE SAID TWENTY SECONDS TO UM
WHAT WAS THAT LAST WEE BIT THERE
SPEECH RECOGNITION RIGHT OKAY
BUT THAT WAS ONLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT PREFERRED IT OLDER PEOPLE DIDN'T
WELL THAT'S RIGHT
SOUNDS REASONABLE
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO
WELL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID HAVING A SECOND PRODUCT 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU COULD HAVE A SECOND PRODUCT THAT GAVE YOU THE RIGHT PITCH WHICH WOULD SET THE REMOTE OFF TO SAY HERE I AM SORT OF THING
YOU KNOW WITHOUT SOUND RECOGNITION
BUT IF YOU
I KNOW
UM I WAS GONNA SAY A SHARP NOISE YOU KNOW A CLAPPING OF HAND OR WHATEVER
YOU'D WANT TO TRY AND AV JUST HAVE THE ONE PRODUCT THAT IF
YEAH
UM I DUNNO UM TALKING ABOUT VO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'VE GOT VOICE RECOGNITION THEN YOU CAN DO IT IN THAT WAY BECAUSE IT'LL RECOGNISE THE VOICE AND YOU CAN GIVE IT A COMMAND
A SET COMMAND WHATEVER THAT HAPPENED TO BE
BUT YOU'VE THEN GOT THE POINT IF IF YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH UH VOICE RECOGNITION THEN
MM
SO UH ANY SUGGES WELL ANY CONCLUSIONS
WELL IF IT DOES THEN WE CAN'T
IT'S THAT SIMPLE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT UH TH TH THREE UM PRIMARY UM UH REQUISITES FROM UH
FROM AND EMAIL UH THAT WAS SENT TO ME WHEREBY WE HAD THE DESIGN LOGO WAS ONE WHICH WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED
WE'VE GOT UM THE REMOTE WAS ONLY FOR THE TELEVISION AND NOT FOR BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT TOO COMPLEX AND WE HAVE TO GET IT MARKET QUICKLY
AND THE UH THIRD THING WAS THAT UM TELETEXT UH AS FAR AS UH THE MANAGEMENT IS CONCERNED
UM IS BECOMING DATED UH DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET
SO THAT MEANS THAT UH SO THESE ARE THE SORT OF THREE UM EXTRA PARAMETERS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT ON THIS UH PROJECT
SO WE'RE BEING FOCUSED EFFECTIVELY DIRECTLY AT A TELEVISION AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MANAGEMENT IS UH WANTING US TO GO DOWN A NARROW PATH AND NOT OPENING OUT
SO ANYTHING THAT UH IS TO BE ADDED
SUCH AS VOICE RECOGNITION ET CETERA HAS TO BE VERY SIMPLE AND HAS TO BE VERY QUICK BECAUSE TIME TO MARKET IS IS CRITICAL
S
IT WOULD
BUT PROBABLY QUICK AND SIMPLE IS PRIMARY RATHER THAN
ADDED EXTRAS
ADDED EXTRAS WOULD BE NICE BUT THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IS TO GET THE PROJECT FINISHED WITHIN UH THIS SHORT TIME WINDOW
WHICH EFFECTIVELY NOW IS SORT OF FOUR HOURS
SO AND IF AND WE'VE GOTTA GET TO THE END
UH D D I THINK I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'VE GOTTA GET TO THE END AND THEN GET TO THE END WITH UM ADDED EXTRAS IF POSSIBLE
OKAY
RIGHT OKAY UH SO I NEED TO
RIGHT
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE HAVE LEFT OF OUR UH TIME
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS ON UH THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
AND HOW WE WERE PLANNING TO PROCEED SO THAT AT THE NEXT UH MEETING
EACH PERSON THAT'S GOT A A A TASK TO DO IS CLEAR FROM THIS MEETING WHAT THAT TASK IS
WE'LL ALSO KNOW W WHEN THE NEXT MEETING IS I UM SO WE'LL KNOW HOW LONG WE'VE GOT TO COMPLETE THAT TASK
AND THEN WE CAN REPORT BACK AT THE NEXT MEETING AND SAY RIGHT OKAY YES
WE'VE ACHIEVED THIS OR WE HAVEN'T ACHIEVED THIS THIS IS HOW FAR WE'VE PROGRESSED
DOES THAT MAKE REASONABLE SENSE
SO WE HAVE TO COME EFFECTIVELY TO THE DECISION ON THE REMOTE FUNCTIONS SO THAT YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING
AND IF DUR BETWEEN THE TIME OF THIS MEETING FINISHING AND THE NEXT MEETING STARTING
IF YOU GET ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT UH ONLY YOU HAVE AT THAT POINT IN TIME YOU'D THINK WOULD BE RELEVANT TO OTHER PEOPLE IN TERMS OF THEIR DES DECISION MAKING UM PROCESS
THEN WE SHOULD COMMUNICATE THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING
DO IT VIA THE EMAIL SO THAT RATHER THAN COMING YOU KNOW IF YOU GET THE INFORMATION JUST BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING THAT'S FINE
COME ALONG WITH IT IN THE NEXT MEETING WE CAN DISCUSS IT THEN AND TAKE WHATEVER ACTION IS APPROPRIATE
BUT IF YOU GET IT WELL BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING
LET EVERYBODY ELSE KNOW 'CAUSE THAT MIGHT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR UH ON WHAT THEY COME UP WITH EFFECTIVELY AT THE NEXT MEETING
OKAY
RIGHT IS THERE
I WOULD GUESS SO
YEP
I W WELL UH I
SOMETHING SIMPLE
UH IF IF OUR PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IS TO GET IT THERE IN TIME TIME'S SHORT
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO MEET THE MAJOR CONCERNS OF THE CONSUMER SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT AS A SELLING POINT FOR THE PRODUCT SOMETHING THAT'S QUICK AND SIMPLE
SO SOUNDS GOOD
WELL SO MAYBE A CLAP RATHER THAN A WHISTLE WOULD BE ON THE BASIS THAT IF WE'VE GOT IF WE'RE CATERING TO THE WHOLE AGE RANGE
YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S EASY TO DO NOW SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T LIKE WHIS UH WELL I I I DON'T KNOW
WELL IF YOU THINK THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN WHISTLE THAN CLAP THEN THAT'S FINE THEN GO FOR THAT OPTION
BUT IF I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD CLAP RATHER THAN WHISTLE SO UH SO CLAP OPTION
OKAY
UH
EF EFFECTIVELY THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING THAT UH IF UH IF PEOPLE ARE NOW USING THE INTERNET THEN YOU DON'T NEED TELETEXT
SO SO TAKE OUT TELETEXT
YEAH
NO
BUT THE BUT THAT'S RELYING ON THE TELEVISION MARKET CHANGING TO AN AUTOMATIC AND IF IT IS AT THE MOMENT THAT'S FINE
BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DEVICE THAT CATERS
'CAUSE OTHERWISE IT WOULD MAKE IT UH YOUR DEVICE WOULD BECOME INOPERABLE
OR ONLY OPERABLE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE IDEA IS TO HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET WHICH IS AND IT'S ALSO M IT'S THE THE PRODUCT WE'VE GOT IS SOMETHING THAT'S AT THE I WOULD HAVE SAID THE LOWER END OF THE S OF THE COST SCALE
SO WE'RE NOT REALLY GOING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S UH
TERRIBLY HIGH TECH
POSSIBLY
THAT'S RIGHT
OKAY WELL
MM
SO Y AH THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA
SO YOU KEEP UM RIGHT WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE WE WIND UP THIS MEETING SO I'VE BEEN TOLD
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT THE SAME
OKAY
SO SO KEEP UM KEEP DETAILED FUNCTIONS UM HIDDEN AT THE BACK
AH
MM-HMM
THAT'S RIGHT
DATA FUNCTIONS HIDDEN AT BACK
CAN BRING OUT WHEN NEEDED
THAT'S RIGHT SO WE'RE DIS SO YOU'VE GOT WHICH ONES ARE GONNA BE ON THE FRONT AND WHICH ONES ARE GONNA BE ON THE BACK
WE HAVE TO DECIDE
I GUESS SO
SO ON FRONT
NUMBERS
VOLUME
SORRY
MM
MM-HMM
SO SO ARE YOU HAVING THE STAND BY ON THE FRONT THEN
WELL
CHANNEL UP AND DOWN
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT
WHAT WAS THAT SIXTEEN
VOLUME BUTTON
HOW MANY VOLUMES
RIGHT OKAY
POWER BUTTON STAND BY CHANNEL UP AND DOWN
SO IS THAT IT
OKAY
THAT'S SIXTEEN BUTTONS YOU RECKON
AND THEN AT THE BACK
OKAY
SO ON THE BACK
IT'LL HAVE BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST ANYTHING ELSE
YOU'RE ALSO GONNA HAVE THE CHANNEL TUNER AS IT WERE
TUNER WOULD THAT HAVE UP AND DOWN
OKAY
OKAY
UM UP VOLUME YEAH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
WELL YOU MIGHT GET SOME RESEARCH
OKAY
RIGHT SO I'LL DO THE MINUTES OF UH THIS MEETING
AND WE'LL MEET BACK AT I'M NOT SURE
UM FORTY MINUTES I BELIEVE IS THE TIME
COME ON
WE HAVE A I GUESS WE HAVE A PRESENTATION EACH 'CAUSE I'VE GOT ONE
UM
MM-HMM
UH WE DIDN'T NO
I D I DIDN'T PERSONALLY
OKAY THAT'S FINE
I'LL JUST UM I'LL GRAB THE WIRE OUT THE BACK OF THIS ONE
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW IT
CONTROL
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE WORKING AT THE MOMENT
ALT FUNCTION F. EIGHT
AGAIN NOT DOING ANYTHING
OH
PRESSED ABOUT FIVE TIMES NOW
OKAY THAT'S ME
OKAY UM I HAVE TO GO AGAIN
HOPEFULLY THAT SHOULD BE IT THIS TIME
OKAY I THINK WE'RE THERE
THAT'S GOOD
OKAY UM
OKAY I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE WORKING DESIGN
UM OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM I'VE JUST GOT THREE SECTIONS FIRST IS THE RESEARCH I MADE ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF UM
AND THEN THAT INVOLVES THE COMPONENTS REQUIRED IN IT AND THE SYSTEMS UH DESIGN OF THE ACTUAL THE ACTUAL REMOTE
UM SO HAVING RESEARCHED THE EXISTING MODELS WITHIN THE MARKET UM I FOUND MY RESEARCH OFF THE INTERNET
UM I'VE ESTABLISHED WHAT THE COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO FUNCTION ACTUALLY ARE
AND THEN ALSO THE METHODS IN WHICH THESE COMPONENTS INTERACT TOGETHER FOR THE REMOTE TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT YOU WANT IT TO DO AND HOW IT CONNECTS WITH THE TELEVISION
UM THE BASIC COMPONENTS ARE AN ENERGY SOURCE WHICH I GUESS UM IN MOST EXISTING MODELS WOULD BE A BATTERY SUPPLY
WHETHER THAT'LL BE SORT OF TWO BATTERIES FOUR BATTERIES UM IT MAY VARY
WE THEN HAVE THE USER INTERFACE WHICH IS BASICALLY THE LIKE THE THE BUTTONS ON THE ACTUAL REMOTE
UM THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS USED FOR CHANGING CHANNEL UH CHANNEL UP AND DOWN VOLUME THINGS LIKE THAT
UM THERE'S ALSO A CHIP INSIDE THE REMOTE WHICH DOES ALL THE COMPUTER TYPE THINGS
AND THEN THE SENDER WHICH UM
IS USUALLY I'VE FOUND AN INFRA RED DEVICE WHICH SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE ACTUAL TELEVISION
UM AND THE LAST PART IS RECEIVER WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN THE SYSTEM BUT IS NOT ACTUALLY PART OF THE REMOTE ITSELF BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY FOUND IN THE TELEVISION
UM I'M GONNA HAVE TO ACTUALLY DRAW ON THE BOARD BECAUSE UH IT WAS A LITTLE TRICKY ON POWERPOINT TO GET THIS WORKING SO
I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THERE
S UM UM DO WE HAVE A CLOTH TO WIPE THIS DOWN WITH OR
OH I'LL J
OH I SEE
OH OKAY
I'LL GET RID OF THE BEAR
OKAY THAT'S GREAT
OKAY SO WE START OFF WITH A UM BATTERY SUPPL UH NO A POWER SUPPLY WHICH WE'D PROBABLY GET IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE BATTERY
UM
WE THEN HAVE
A PARTICULAR BUTTON WHICH MAY BE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THERE'S LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS
UM BUT THIS IS HOW THE BASIC SYSTEM WORKS
UM THAT SENDS AFTER YOU PRESS THAT THAT SENDS THE MESSAGE TO
THE CHIP WHICH UM THEN SENDS
IT SORT OF INTERPRETS WHICH BUTTON YOU'VE PRESSED AND THEN SENDS THE APPROPRIATE MESSAGE TO THE SENDER
UM
SO THAT'S
THAT'S THE REMOTE IN ITSELF THAT'S THE COMPONENTS OF THE REMOTE AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER
SO THIS IS THE UH USER
INTERFACE
UM THIS IS THE CHIP ITSELF WHICH THEN AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE INFRA RED
SENDER
AND THEN ON THE SEPARATE THING WE HAVE ON THE
ON THE TELEVISION
WE HAVE A
A RECEIVER
AND THE SENDER SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE RECEIVER
'KAY
AH YES THAT'S THE POWER SOURCE
UM
GOING ON TO PERSONAL PREFERENCES I'VE SAID THAT BATTERY SEEMS THE BEST OPTION FOR THE ACTUAL REMOTE JUST BECAUSE OF THE SIZE
YOU DON'T WANT A A CABLE ATTACHED TO THE REMOTE OTHERWISE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT REALLY A REMOTE
UM AND THEN THE SENDER AND INFRA RED UM HAS BEEN USED QUITE SUCCESSFULLY
IF THE BATTERY'S ON REASONABLE POWER THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO WORK FAIRLY WELL
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE POINT DIRECTLY AT THE TELEVISION ITSELF
UM
YES
'KAY AND THAT'S IT FOR THE MOMENT
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THE THE EXTRA BUTTONS HERE
THE THE SORT OF CIRCULAR SECTION BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE FOR A VIDEO AS WELL
SO WE COULD DISPENSE WITH THAT LITTLE BIT AS WELL AND JUST GET IT DOWN TO JUST THE NUMBERS AND THE VOLUME
POSSIBLY
J YEAH YEAH YEAH J YEAH JUST THIS LITTLE BIT IS THAT I THINK THAT'S STILL UM A VIDEO REMOTE PART
SO MAYBE WE COULD GET RID OF THAT AS WELL
IT'S JUST PEOPLE ARE USED TO SEEING THAT SO IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THEM THEN THEY MIGHT THINK IT'S
HMM
OKAY YEAH
I SUPPOSE WITH NINE YOU'VE GOT THE THE LIKE THE LAST ONE WHICH MAKES THE TENTH MEANS YOU UH IT'S LIKE UH MULTIPLES YOU CAN PUT THEM TOGETHER SO YOU CAN MAKE ANY NUMBER
SO WITH THAT WE'D KIND OF BY PASS ANY PROBLEMS WITH
YEAH
YEAH
'CAUSE THAT FACILITATES HAVING ALL THE NUMBERS YOU COULD EVER NEED
UM
SO WE COULD GET IT DOWN TO WHAT
SO WE GET TO HOW MANY BUTTONS HAVE WE GOT
WE'VE JUST GOT TEN ELEVEN TWELVE TH WE GOT FOURTEEN THAT WE NEED
I GUESS
UM WHICH ISN'T REALLY TOO MANY
THAT'LL BE QUITE EASY TO MAKE A USER GUIDE FOR A FOURTEEN BUTTON REMOTE
'KAY
'KAY
AH YES YES THAT SEEMS GOOD
I THINK IF YOU JUST GIVE IT A SECOND TO MAYBE CATCH UP
I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE BY THE END OF TODAY
MM
NO WHAT I MAYBE THINK IS UM
IT SEEMS THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE QUITE ADVANCED FOR THAT AND THEY MIGHT END UP COSTING MORE THAN OUR TWELVE FIFTY BUDGET FOR
FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
UM
AND POSSIBLY THE THING ABOUT THE ABOUT THE REMOTE BEING LOST WE COULD HAVE YOU KNOW WITH YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU LOSE THAT AND YOU CAN RING IT
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOME KIND OF SENSOR WHICH IS KEPT SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN SOME KIND OF BUZZER SYSTEM BETWEEN THE TWO
SO YOU CAN PRESS A BUTTON WHICH IS ALWAYS KEPT IN ONE PLACE AND THEN IT MAYBE BUZZES TO SOMEWHERE ELSE WHEREVER THE REMOTE ACTUALLY IS
THAT IS TRUE YES
HMM
SO I GUESS IT'D BE SOMETHING WE COULD LIKE ATTACH TO THE OR LIKE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY COULD BE PUT INSIDE THE
INSIDE THE REMOTE
YEAH
YEAH IF WE IF WE COULD HAVE IT IN THE ACTUAL REMOTE LIKE EVERYTHING IN ONE ONE DEVICE
YOU COULD HAVE AN OPTION TO TURN IT OFF
OR
PERHAPS UM
SO THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE T. V. KIND OF SPEAKING TO THE REMOTE AND CHANGING ITS OWN CHANNELS
MM
'KAY
YES
HAS TO BE SIMPLE ENOUGH TO
I SUPPOSE IF WE COULD GET SOMETHING IN WHICH WAS QUITE QUICK AND SIMPLE THAT WOULD GIVE US AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER REMOTES
UM
'KAY
MM-HMM
YES
UM
YES THAT SEEMS RIGHT
MM-HMM
OKAY
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE JUST ON THE WHISTLE BACK FUNCTION AT THE MOMENT AND IF SOMETHING COMES BACK
I'D GO MORE YEAH F MORE FOR CLAP
DID WE DECIDE ON HAVING THE TEN UM THE TEN NUMBERS AND THEN THE THE LITTLE DIGIT NEXT TO IT WHICH KIND OF ENABLED YOU TO PUT THEM TOGETHER
OKAY TEN NUMBERS AND THEN SOME KIND OF DEVICE TO ALLOW UH
I'LL PUT DELAY TO ALLOW UM MULTIPLE NUMBERS
OR MULTIPLE DIGITS
DID WE DECIDE ANYTHING ABOUT UM THE OTHER FUNCTIONS
AS IN SETTING THE AUDIO AND TUNING IT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YOU HAD AN HAD AN IDEA ABOUT THE MENU
BUT JUST THINKING UM PEOPLE PROBABLY I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE YOU ONLY HAVE TO PROBABLY TUNE IN THE T. V. ONCE
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TUNE IT THAT ONCE
SO AND IF FINALLY THE T. V. BREAKS YOU GET A NEW ONE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TUNE IT
YOU CAN'T REALLY AVOID THAT
EXCEPT THE NEW DIGITAL MARKETS WHICH DO IT BY THEMSELVES
SO THAT'LL BE IN
YES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SO HOW WOULD THIS MENU FUNCTION WORK
WOULD YOU MAYBE HAVE LIKE ONE MENU BUTTON THEN YOU'D USE THE OTHER BUTTONS MAYBE THE NUMBER BUTTONS TO ACTUALLY DO THE SEPARATE FUNCTIONS
OKAY
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE THE INDIVIDUAL NUMBERS AND THEN A MENU FUNCTION AND MAYBE SORT OF A SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED UM INSTRUCTION BOOKLET TO COME WITH IT
TO GUIDE PRESU UH I THINK IT'D BE QUITE HARD JUST FOR PEOPLE TO GRASP UM JUST OFF LIKE THE MENU USE DIFFERENT BUTTONS YOU MAYBE HAVE TO HAVE LIKE SOME BETTER INSTRUCTIONS OF HOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK
RIGHT OKAY UM
THAT ALSO GOES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DESIGN WHEN WE SAW THOSE TWO
AND THERE WAS THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE WHICH HAD ALL LIKE THE DOUBLE FUNCTIONS AND STUFF WHICH KIND OF LOOKED TOO BUSY AND HAD TOO MUCH ON IT
SO
THAT IS THAT IS A GOOD IDEA ACTUALLY
SOR SORT OF A SECOND
OKAY
UH NOT QUITE BUT I GUESS
KEEP THE OTHER BUTTONS BUT HIDE THEM AWAY
SO
SO UM WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE TO WORK OUT WHAT'S GONNA BE ON THESE OTHER FUNCTIONS AS AS WELL
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE TWO SEPARATE TWO SEPARATE LISTS I GUESS
SO SH
SHOULD WE DECIDE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN
SO ON THE
ABOUT THE NUMBER
UM THE VOLUME UP AND DOWN
SHALL WE HAVE A MUTE BUTTON AS WELL
A MUTE BUTTON AS WELL
YEAH
OR
BUT THEN THEY MIGHT NOT BUY IT IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT ONE
'CAUSE PEOPLE MIGHT JUST BE TOO FICKLE AND NOT WANT TO CHANGE
WE CAN SEND OUT A FLIER WITH THE DEVICE SAYING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE IT ON STAND BY
I THINK YOU PROBABLY SHOULD
UM ARE WE GONNA HAVE THE CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AS WELL AS THE NUMBER BUTTONS
OKAY SO WE'LL HAVE UM
SO WE'VE GOT TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THERE
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
UM
MAYBE IF WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF TIME
ONE OF US SHOULD COME UP WITH A LIST OF THESE AND THEN GET BACK AT THE NEXT MEETING JUST AT THE START AND SAY WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE
SO TUNER UP AND DOWN I GUESS
UM UP TUNE ONE WAY TUNE THE O I I DUNNO I DUNNO POSSIBLY
OH YEAH AND TH AND A ENTER BUTTON JUST TO SELECT
YEAH OKAY
UM I GUESS WE'RE KEEPING S IT SIMPLE
WE DON'T REALLY NEED ANY OTHER AUDIO FUNCT UH FUNCTIONS BECAUSE IT'S JUST VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN
UM
DO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CONTROLS ON THEIR ACTUAL PRODUCTS THEN OR DO YOU HAVE TO DO IT VIA THE REMOTE
YEAH I SUPPOSE IF WE'VE GOT THEIR IF THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CONTROLS THEN WE CAN AVOID IT FOR OURS JUST TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
OH OKAY
RIGHT
UM
MAYBE UNLESS SOMETHING COMES UP THEN WE SHOULD I THINK
WELL SHALL WE LOOK INTO THAT AND JUST GET BACK TOGETHER
'KAY
YEAH
NO
WHAT IS IT
I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO DO UM CONTROL F. EIGHT
SHIFT F. EIGHT
AH THERE IT'S DOING SOMETHING
I THINK IT'S THAT LITTLE
RIGHT
THANK YOU
MINE'S NOT QUITE AS COMPLICATED AS ALL THAT
DID I PRESS FUNCTION
YEAH
OH
UM
OKAY SO I'M GONNA TALK A BIT ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
I'M LOUISA THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER AS YOU KNOW
UM SO THE M BASIC METHOD OF THIS IS TO SEND A SIGNAL FROM THE REMOTE TO THE TELEVISION SET SO THAT A DESIRED FUNCTION IS PERFORMED
UM AN EXAMPLE OF THE FUNCTION COULD BE TO CHANGE THE VOLUME UP OR DOWN UH SO OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT BUTTONS FOR THAT
UM TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL EITHER BY PRESSING THE NUMBER THAT YOU WANT OR BY CHANNEL UP OR DOWN
UM TO SWITCH THE TELEVISION ON OR OFF MAYBE A STANDBY BUTTON
UM HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLE REMOTES
UM BY THE LOOK OF IT THEY BOTH HAVE UM KIND OF PLAY AND FAST FORWARD REWIND FUNCTIONS
SO I THINK THEY INCORPORATE A KIND OF VIDEO FUNCTION WHICH WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
UH BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE LEFT REMOTE IS QUITE UM QUITE BUSY LOOKING QUITE COMPLICATED
UM WHEREAS THE RIGHT REMOTE IS MUCH SIMPLER IT LOOKS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY
UM SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE WOULD BE THE RIGHT REMOTE
SO IT'S GOT NICE BIG BUTTONS IT'S GOT A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF BUTTONS
UM THEY'RE NICE KINDA CLEARLY LABELLED
UM I LIKE THE USE OF THE KIND OF UM SYMBOLS LIKE THE TRIANGLES AND THE SQUARES AND THE ARROWS AS WELL AS THE WORDS ON THE UM KIND OF PLAY FUNCTIONS AND ALL THAT
SO IT'S VERY VERY USER FRIENDLY AND IT'S GOT A LITTLE SPLASH OF COLOUR
COULD MAYBE DO WITH SOME MORE COLOUR
UM
HMM
DO WE GET TO SEE THAT
WILL YOU BE PRESENTING THAT IN A BIT
HMM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE CIRCULAR SECTION
LIKE ALL OF THAT BOTTOM BIT
YEAH
YEAH
AND I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT YOU NEED NINE NUMBERS
I MEAN HOW OFTEN DO YOU USE SEVEN EIGHT AND NINE
I THINK JUST ONE TO SIX AND THEN CHANNEL UP AND DOWN SHOULD BE ENOUGH
LIKE HOW OFTEN DO YOU HIT NINE
HMM
UM SOME REMOTES HAVE KIND OF FAVOURITE OPTIONS WHERE IF YOU ALWAYS FLICK FROM CHANNEL ONE TO CHANNEL SIX
UM IF THAT'S A FAVOURITE YOU JUST LIKE BY PASS TWO TO FIVE
HMM
MM
UM
BUT I THINK A LOT OF UM LIKE CABLE AND SKY AND STUFF THAT WOULD BE TUNED TO ONE CHANNEL
AND THEN YOU'D HAVE ANOTHER REMOTE FOR ALL OF THOSE CHANNELS
LIKE TO GET TO FIFTY FIVE AND THE HIGHER NUMBERS
YEAH
BUT I SUPPOSE NINE'S NOT REALLY EXCESSIVE
I SUPPOSE IT DOES MAKE A GOOD PATTERN
OKAY
UM I THINK THAT'S JUST FOR A VIDEO SO WE WOULDN'T NEED ANY OF THAT AT ALL
MM-HMM
OKAY SO IS EVERYONE HAPPY WITH THAT
RIGHT WELL THAT'S THE END OF MY PRESENTATION
DO A LOT OF UM
THERE'S KEY RINGS UM THAT YOU KIND OF WHISTLE AT OR CLAP AT I CAN'T REMEMBER AND THEN THEY WHISTLE BACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THAT'D PROBABLY BE REALLY SIMPLE THEY'RE CHEAP
YEAH
WELL I THINK IT'D BE REALLY EASY AND IT'D BE A BIG ADVANTAGE IF WE DID HAVE SOME SORT OF UM KIND OF WHISTLE BACK KIND OF FUNCTION
'CAUSE THAT'LL SOLVE KIND OF THE FRUSTRATION OF LOSING IT
YEAH
I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND THAT WOULDN'T PUT OFF THE KIND OF OLDER GENERATION EITHER
'CAUSE EVERYONE CAN WHISTLE OR CLAP AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE KIND OF SCARED OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY
'KAY WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED THAT WE DON'T NEED A TELETEXT BUTTON HAVEN'T WE
IS THAT ONE OF THE
HMM
RIGHT
YEAH I THINK SO SO ZERO TO NINE
HMM
MM
YEAH
YEAH LIKE THE VOLUME OR SOMETHING
YEAH 'CAUSE YOU DO NEED UM KIND OF BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST AND EVERYTHING AS WELL
MY DAD WAS WATCHING A FILM THE OTHER WEEK AND IT WAS TOO DARK SO I HAD TO GO THROUGH IT AND TURN THE BRIGHTNESS UP
WELL IF WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT SLEE SLEEK AND SEXY AS WELL
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE REMOTES WHERE KIND OF UM THE BOTTOM BIT SLIDES DOWN SO THERE'S KIND OF UM EVERYTHING ELSE REVEALED
SO YOU DON'T USE IT THAT MUCH YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE IT ALL THE TIME
BUT IT'S ALL THERE IF YOU NEED IT
LIKE A HIDDEN PANEL
HMM
AND THAT'LL BE BETTER FOR THE OLDER GENERATION AS WELL 'CAUSE WELL MY DAD DOESN'T LIKE ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE GOT TO KINDA FLICK THROUGH A MENU
BUT HE CAN PRETTY MUCH READ A BUTTON IF IT'S DISPLAYED PROPERLY
YEAH
AND THE VOLUME
UM
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THEY'RE HANDY
I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY LIKE UM
NOT AN ISSUE TO RAISE HERE BUT UM THE WHOLE THING ABOUT NOT USING YOUR STANDBY UH BECAUSE OF THE LIKE WASTE OF ELECTRICITY
HAVE YOU SEEN THE ADVERTS
LIKE IF YOU BOIL THE KETTLE THAT'S FULL THAT'S A WASTE
IF YOU LEAVE YOUR TELLY ON STANDBY IT POWERS BLACKPOOL FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME
LIKE WE SHOULD MAYBE TRY TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM STANDBY
YEAH IT'S MAYBE TOO MUCH OF A BIG ISSUE FOR HERE
UH OH DANGER SIGN
YEAH BUT A LITTLE BIT SMALLER
COMPROMISE
RIGHT
ON MUTE
SO
AND THEN
MM-HMM
UH THERE'S AUDIO FUNCTIONS
YEAH
I THINK THEY NORMALLY DO
YEAH
SO I THINK UM
THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF LIKE DOLBY SURROUND STUDIO SURROUND SORT OF THINGS
UM MAYBE FOR THE YOUNGER MARKET
UM I THINK THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CONTROLS IN THIS KIND OF LIKE HIDDEN PANEL
OH NO I MEAN UM LIKE THERE'S KIND OF INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS FOR THEM LIKE ON THE T. V. REMOTE
BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FOR I'VE NEVER USED THEM
I JUST KNOW THEY'RE SOMETHING TO DO WITH DOLBY
RIGHT
YEAH I'VE GOT ONE TOO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
THERE'S USUALLY A LITTLE THING IN THE TOP RIGHT FOR THE OH HANG ON IT'S JUST COMING ON
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM
I'M NOT SURE
I HAD I'VE HAD SOME MARKET INFORMATION BUT NOT FROM THE COMPANY NO
OKAY
'KAY
I'M GONNA PULL THIS OFF
UH-HUH
OKAY
I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER GO
YEAH THERE WE GO
RIGHT WE'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH INTO THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT PEOPLE WANT OUT OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
AND FIRST OFF WE SHOULD STATE THAT TH THE REMOTE CONTROL'S FOR CONTROLLING THE T. V.
AND UM HOW DO PEOPLE USE IT
WE ASKED THEM SORT OF WHICH BUTTONS WERE USEFUL FOR THEM
UM HOW D HOW DOES A REMOTE CONTROL LOOK AND FEEL FOR THEM AND WHAT IMPROVEMENTS WOULD WOULD THEY LIKE TO REMOTE CONTROL
AND WE DID THAT BY SORT OF GIVING THEM A QUESTIONNAIRE THAT WE'D PREPARED AND ASKING THEM TO FILL IN THE ANSWERS
AND THREE QUARTERS OF THEM FOUND THAT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE UGLY AND THAT A SORT OF EVEN HIGHER PROPORTION WOULD SPEND MORE FOR A SORT OF S UH A FANCIER REMOTE CONTROL
AND THAT OF ALL THE BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
THE SORT OF SETTING BUTTONS FOR SORT OF THE PICTURE PICTURE AND BRIGHTNESS AND THE AUDIO SETTINGS UM THEY WEREN'T USED VERY OFTEN AT ALL
PEOPLE CONCENTRATED ON THE CHANNEL BUTTONS AND THE VOLUME BUTTONS AND THE POWER BUTTONS
UH WE ALSO ASKED THEM ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION UH FOR REMOTE CONTROL
AND YOUNG PEOPLE WERE QUITE RECEPTIVE TO THIS
BUT AS SOON AS WE GOT SORT OF OVER ABOUT INTO A THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY AGE FORTY FIVE AGE GROUP AND OLDER
PEOPLE PEOPLE WEREN'T QUITE SO KEEN ON SPEECH RECOGNITION
THERE'S A LOT MORE TH THERE'S A LOT LOT MORE OLDER PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THEY WANTED IT OR NOT AS WELL
UM WE ALSO ASKED WHAT FRUSTRATED PEOPLE ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS AND THE NUMBER ONE FRUSTRATION WAS THAT THE REMOTE WAS LOST SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE ROOM AND THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND IT
AND THE SECOND SECOND BIGGEST FRUSTRATION WHAT THAT IF THEY GOT A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO LEARN UM ALL THE BUTTONS AND ALL THE FUNCTIONS AND TO FIND YOUR WAY AROUND IT
OKAY SO
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES FROM THE MARKETING IS THAT WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF SLEEK SORT OF GOOD LOOKING HIGH HIGH TECH A DESIGN WHICH LOOKS HIGH TECH
BASICALLY
UM AND THAT WE SHOULD COME UP WITH FEWER BUTTONS THAN MOST OF THE CONTROLS ON THE MARKET
AND WE SHOULD SORT OF CONCENTRATE ON THE CHANNELS AND SORT OF POWER AND ALSO VOLUME AND THAT SORT OF THING AS AS LOUISA SAID
UM WE COULD MAYBE COME UP WITH A MENU A SORT OF A AN L. C. D. MENU FOR OTHER FUNCTIONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT
UM AND MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION AS WELL BECAUSE UM SORT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE
PERHAPS THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA BUY BUY OUR NEW PRODUCT IF WE AIM IT AT SORT OF YOU KNOW SORT OF A HIGH TECH DESIGN
THAT THAT MIGHT BE THE MARKET THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR
AND WE COULD MAYBE THINK ABOUT USING SPEECH RECOGNITI RECOGNITION AS A WAY TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL IF IT'S LOST IN A ROOM
RATHER THAN SORT OF UM HAVING IT TO SPEECH RECOGNITION TO CHANGE THE CHANNELS
'CAUSE THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT IN THAT THE TELEVISION MAKES NOISE SO IT COULD END UP TALKING TO ITSELF AND CHANGING ITS CHANNEL
OKAY UM AND THAT'S THE END OF THE SLIDE SHOW
THAT'S IT
COOL
UM ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH
YOUN YOUNG PEOPLE PREF YEAH
THEY S THEY SAID THAT THEY'D BE INTERESTED IN A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH OFFERED THAT POSSIBILITY AND AS YOU GO UP THROUGH THE AGE GROUPS
PEOPLE GOT LESS AND LESS INTERESTED IN SORT OF A A REMOTE CONTROL THAT YOU COULD TALK TO SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH WE'D HAVE T THAT WOULD MEAN WE'D HAVE TO PUT TWO PRODUCTS TOGETHER AS WELL WHICH WHICH AGAIN WOULD PROBABLY BE A BIT EXPENSIVE BUT
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM WOULD IT TAKE QUITE A WHILE TO SORT OF DEVELOP THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
CONSIDERING
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEP
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO DO WE NEED TO DECIDE ON THE FUNCTIONS NOW
S
MM-HMM
YEAH AND
YEAH AND THAT WAS THAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE SORT OF FRUSTRATION THAT PEOPLE SAID SO
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE ON THE MARKET THAT DOES THAT SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO NOT EVERYONE CAN WHISTLE CAN THEY THOUGH
NO CLAPPING I THINK CLAPPING YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
TAKING OUT TELETEXT OKAY
MM
I THINK NOWADAYS YOU CAN JUST GET ONES WHERE IT GIVES YOU A SORT OF A SECOND OR TWO TO PRESS ANOTHER NUMBER
SO YOU CAN PRESS ANY TWO AND IT'LL SORT OF PUT THEM TOGETHER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH WE COULD POSSIBLY PUT AN L. A SORT OF A L. C. D. MENU IN BUT THAT AGAIN IS PROBABLY AN EXPENSE THAT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I S I SUPPOSE UM
IF PEOPLE ARE BUYING REMOTES THEN THEY'RE PROBABLY BUYING IT TO REPLACE ANOTHER REMOTE 'CAUSE ALL MOST TELLIES COME WITH REMOTES SO
I MEAN WE'RE MAYBE TALKING ABOUT REPLACING REMOTES FOR SLIGHTLY OLDER TELEVISIONS SO WE MAYBE NEED TO KEEP THE THE TUNING FUNCTION IN
YEAH THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
UH
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THE SORT OF HAVING PEOPLE HAVE A BOOKLET 'CAUSE ONE THE SECOND MOST ANNOYING THING THAT PEOPLE FOUND WAS HAVING TO LEARN THE NEW ONE
SO MAYBE NEXT TO EACH OF THE BUTTONS
YOU KNOW EACH OF THEM COULD HAVE A NUMBER AND THEN ALSO A FUNCTION WRITTEN NEXT TO IT SO YOU'RE BASICALLY PRESSING
RIGHT
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO TH THE
THE DETAILED ONES WOULD BE SORT OF BRIGHTNESS UH SORTA
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND PROBABLY A POWER ONE AS WELL
DUNNO
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UM 'CAUSE YEAH THE MARKET RESEARCH SAID THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO JUST ZAP AROUND AND FLICK SO
UM
NUMBERS IS TEN VOLUME IS
TWELVE TH YEAH SI ONE UP ONE DOWN
AND A MUTE YEAH
THAT'S SIXTEEN ISN'T IT YEAH
I DON'T THINK SO NO
YOU'VE GOT
BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN MAYBE SORT OF AN ENTER BUTTON FOR
SORT OF S YOU KNOW SAYING THAT YOU WANT THAT PARTICULAR THING TUNED IN
SO YOU GO UP AND DOWN AND THEN IT PICK IT FINDS SOMETHING AND THEN YOU WANNA PRESS ENTER TO SELECT IT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
RIGHT
OKAY SO
RIGHT WELL UM FROM THE LAST MEETING I WAS TRYING TO SEND YOU THE MINUTES
BUT UH IT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL SO MAYBE IN SORT OF UM
QUICK SUMMARY OF THE LAST UH MEETING I CAN
QUICKLY GIVE YOU
WHAT WE WHAT WE HAD
UH RIGHT SO
WISHING I HADN'T CLOSED THE DAMN RIGHT SO WE HAD THE FACT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE THE LOGO UH THE COMPANY LOGO IN ITS UH COLOUR SCHEME INCORPORATED ONTO THE THE DEVICE THE REMOTE DEVICE
WE HAD UH MADE OUR DECISIONS ABOUT UH
MADE OUR DECISIONS ABOUT UH
THE DEVICE ITSELF THAT IT WAS GONNA BE SIMPLE TO MAKE IT UH
ENABLE US TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT IN TIME
WE'RE GONNA HAVE UH EFFECTIVELY TWO PAGES A FRONT PAGE WHICH HAD THE UH FEATURES THAT THE UH THE CUSTOMERS MOST WANTED
AND THEN THE UH THE BACKUP FEATURES ON THE SECOND PAGE SO THAT IT COULD UH
MEET THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
AND THE CUSTOMERS WOULDN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM TOO OFTEN ONLY AS AND WHEN REQUIRED
SO
SO BASICALLY WHAT DECISIONS UH HAVE WE UH MADE
UH HAVE THERE BEEN ANY UH CHANGES
RIGHT
THREE PRESENTATION YEAH
SO YEAH FINE
OKAY
MM-HMM
WHAT WOULD BE THE COST DO DO WE KNOW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WITH THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS YOU WERE GOING FOR THE
MM-HMM
BUT ARE WE GOING F R RIGHT
SO ARE WE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION NOW IN A SENSE THAT THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH WE'RE DISCUSSING THAT ISSUE
SO WOULD IT NOT BE BEST TO RATHER THAN I MEAN ONE WAY IS TO DO EACH OF THE PRESENTATIONS AND THEN MAKE DECISIONS GOING BACK TO THE VARIOUS PRESENTATIONS AS THEY WERE
THE OTHER WAY WOULD BE TO DO THE PRESENTATION AND THEN MAKE THE DECISION AT THAT POINT IN TIME
'CAUSE AT THAT POINT THEN YOU'VE GOT THE DETAILS UP THERE
SO IF WE WANTED TO KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT THE SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRED THE REGULAR AND WHAT REQUIRED ADVANCE
THEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT DOWN THEN WE COULD MAKE THE DECISION AT THAT POINT IN TIME AND THEN THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THAT ISSUE
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
MM-HMM
NO THE SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRED THE REGULAR SO THE
HMM
OKAY
THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP WHICH IN TURN IS MORE EXPENSE
OKAY
DOWN
RIGHT
OKAY
SO
SO WE'RE GOING FOR P OKAY
SO IS UM
SIMPLE PUSH BUTTON
MM-HMM
SO IF WE GO FOR THE SIMPLE PUSH BUTTON SO EFFECTIVELY WE'RE GOING FOR THE SIMPLE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ARE WE
OR ARE WE GOING FOR THE REGULAR
MM MM
BUT IS THERE ANY OTHER I MEAN OKAY THAT'S TRUE FOR THE FOR FOR THAT ELEMENT BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL EL ELEMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION
AND SO IF THERE IS ONE ELEMENT THAT REQUIRES THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONE
OR SAY THE REGULAR ONE OR THE MORE ADVANCED THEN THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE SAME FOR ALL OF THEM
S
RIGHT
MM-HMM
NO
MM MM
OKAY
SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD
SIMPLE PUSH BUTTON
OKAY
W W KINETIC
YOU WERE YOU WERE WANTING TO GO FOR THE KINETIC POWER SUPPLY
MM-HMM
AND HOW DOES IT GET UH CHARGED UP
OKAY
OKAY
SO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WAS ARE WE GOING FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
NO
'CAUSE THAT REQUIRED THE ADVANCED
I HAD SPEECH RECOGNITION REQUIRES ADVANCED REQ REQUIRE
OH
SO OKAY
SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU RECKON THEN IS S SIMPLE
AND SO WE WOULD WANT IT IN AS AN EXTRA BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO COST TOO MUCH
WOULD THAT BE
IN FACT IT WOULDN'T REALLY COST ANYMORE WOULD IT
AND THEN HAVE TO CHANGE ALL CHANGE EVERYTHING AT THE LAST MINUTE
OKAY
S
SORRY
YEAH I'VE FOUND THAT TRY AND GET IT BACK
SO YOU WERE SAYING THE SCROLL BUTTONS
MM-HMM
WELL WE'RE TO GO FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET RATHER THAN A LOCAL MARKET BUT THAT THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY PRECLUDE THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN OFTEN DO WITH PRODUCTS IS YOU CAN UH MAKE SMALL MODIFICATIONS
SO YOU HAVE YOUR BASIC MODEL WHICH YOU WOULD SELL AT WHATEVER
AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE ADDITIONAL FEATURES IN YOU KNOW LIKE A YOU'D HAVE MODEL ONE
MODEL TWO AND MODEL THREE AND THEREFORE YOU CAN SUB DIVIDE YOUR MARKET UP
BUT THAT'S REALLY WHERE YOUR FIELD IS
ANYWAY YOU COULD ADD ON FOR AN EXTRA PACKAGE
BUT ON THIS BASIC ONE I'M RECKONING THAT WE'RE GOING FOR THE BASIC MODEL TO BE DISCUSSED HERE AND THAT UH YOU WOULD HAVE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDING IN EXTRA FEATURES AT EXTRA COST TO TAKE CARE OF SPECIALIST MARKET SEGMENTS
IS THAT SO SO WHAT ARE WE DECIDING TO DO HERE
RIGHT
MM-HMM
UH THE FI YEAH THE FINDER FUNCTION RATHER THAN AS A SPEECH FUNCTION TO FIND YOUR REMOTE
OKAY
HMM
SO YOU'D HAVE A FINDER FEATURE RATHER THAN A VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE
AND YOU WERE TALKING
MM
AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SCROLL BUTTONS
OKAY
B
ALRIGHT SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE THE THE RUBBER BUTTONS WAS THAT RIGHT
OKAY
SO NOT TO BE FOCUSED ON
GOOD IN IN FLIP IT ROUND IN NINETY DEGREE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES AND HAVE IT UP AND DOWN
AN UPSIDE DOWN V.
SO THAT WOULD SHOW THAT VOLUME WAS GOING UP WHEREAS THE ONE UNDERNEATH WOULD SEE THE VOLUME GOING DOWN
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YOU COULD HAVE VOLUME UP AND VOLUME VOLUME UP DOWN AND LIKE THAT
AND 'CAUSE THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE LIMITED UM IT WAS TO HAVE SIZABLE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ON IT
LIMITED NUMBER OF BUTTONS
'CAUSE IT WAS SIXTEEN BUTTONS WASN'T IT THAT WERE
OKAY
YOU KNOW YOURSELF
WELL YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU SHAPE YOUR BUTTONS 'CAUSE YOU'RE CAN MIS DIRECT PEOPLE
AND I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THE FUNCTIONALITY 'CAUSE THE PEOPLE GET CHEESED OFF BY THINGS BY HAVING TO READ INSTRUCTIONS ET CETERA SO
OKAY
NOW
YEAH
STAND BY BUTTON
NO TH THAT THAT INCORPORATES THE TREND WHILST AT THE SAME TIME NOT CONFUSING PEOPLE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FUNCTIONALITY
BUT WHAT ARE THEY GONNA BE NEXT YEAH
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA BE NEXT YEAR
BUT BUT TH BUT OKAY BUT YOU YOU CAN INCORPORATE THE TR IF Y IF YOU CHANGE ALL THE BUTTONS THEN YOU'VE GOT THE PROBLEM THAT THIS YEAR'S FRUIT AND VEG
NEXT YEAR'S UH I WAS GONNA SAY ANIMALS OR ELEPHANTS OR W WHATEVER
THAT MEANS YOU'RE CONSTANTLY CHANGING YOUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULE AND YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE DIFFERENT MOULDS AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST
WELL
AH D D BUT IF MM-HMM
WELL
YEP
WAS THAT IN THE SORT OF FASHION SENSE THAT THIS OR WAS THE SPONGY FEEL WAS THAT UH SORT OF FASHION
IT WAS WASN'T IT
SO THE
MM-HMM
RUBBER BUTTONS REQUIRE RUBBER CASE
UH SO YEAH
THE M THE MAIN PROBLEM IS HOW F HOW FREQUENTLY DO THE FASHIONS CHANGE
'CAUSE IN ESSENCE IN THE PRODUCTION YOU WANT THINGS TO STAY YOU WANT TO BASICALLY MINT THEM OUT 'CAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT FASHION CHANGES AND THAT YOU'RE INCORPORATING
THEN IT MEANS THAT YOUR STOCK IS UM IS LAST YEAR'S STOCK AND THEREFORE YOU'RE SELLING IT OR HAVING TO SELL IT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE WHICH YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO
WHEREAS IF YOU KEPT THE PRODUCT THE SAME BUT YOU COULD HAVE A DIFFERENCE FROM YEAR TO YEAR
UH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU COULD INCORPORATE A FASHION STATEMENT IF YOU LIKE RATHER THAN CHANGING THE WHOLE KIT AND CABOODLE
YOU'RE JUST CHANGING ONE ASPECT LIKE LIKE THE STANDBY BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE THEN YOU COULD MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT
WELL YOU MIGHT BE LIMITED IN SPACE THAT YES
WELL YOU TWO ARE OBVIOUSLY GONNA FIND THAT OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY WHEN YOU MOVE OVER TO YOUR KIT MODELLING STAGE AS TO UH HOW MUCH PL HOW MUCH HOW MUCH HOW PLIABLE IS PLASTICINE
HMM
SO YOU'RE TALKING THERE ABOUT UH CHANGING
CHANGING THE CASING
YEAH YOU YOU COULD DO A COLOUR CHANGE
SO THEREFORE YOU WOULD YEAH YEAH I MEAN THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT THEY DID WITH THE WITH THE MOBILE PHONES WAS TO HAVE SOME IN BLUE
SOME IN RED SOME IN RATHER THAN ALL IN BLACK OR YOU KNOW WHICH FOUR DO YOU WANT AS LONG AS IT'S BLACK
BUT UH SO
YES OH THAT'S TRUE UH THAT MIGHT NO
WELL NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE YOUR COMPANY UH WE'RE WE'RE MEANT TO BE FINISHING UP
YOU COULD HAVE YOUR COMPANY BADGE AND LOGO
I MEAN A LOT OF UM COMPUTERS FOR INSTANCE LIKE LIKE ON THE ONE YOU'VE GOT THERE
IT ACTUALLY HAS A SORT OF UM STICK ON BADGE SO WHAT YOU WOULD AL ALL YOU WOULD REALLY NEED
WHETHER IT YOU KNOW WHETHER THE CASING BE W ANY COLOUR COULD BE ANY COLOUR
BUT THAT BADGE WOULD THEN HAVE TO STICK OUT ON TOP OF IT SO THAT UH IN A SENSE
WITH A WITH A LOGO LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S ON A WHITE BACKGROUND
THE ONLY COLOUR THAT IT MIGHT NOT STICK OUT SO WELL ON WOULD BE A WHITE CASING
'CAUSE YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE SORT OF YOU'RE BADGING IT
AND IN FACT A LOT OF COMPANIES GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO MAKE THEM AND LITERALLY JUST BADGE THEM THEMSELVES WITH THEIR OWN UH BADGE OVER THE TOP
AND IN FACT THE WAY THEY'VE GOT THAT THERE EVEN IF YOU HAD THAT ON A WHITE WHICH IS THE PREDOMINANT COLOUR OF THE UH THE WINDOWS BADGE
YOU'D STILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT CLEARLY FROM YOU KNOW A WHITE CASING UH PRODUCT
SO
IT'S UH IN IN THE HOUSE ISN'T IT I SUPPOSE
SO DON'T CHANGE CASE
CHANGE CASE COLOUR
AND WE'RE SORT OF SAYING NO TO THAT
YEAH
SOUNDS REASONABLE
IF YOU'RE GOING FOR FASHION TRENDS LIKE THAT THEY'LL NEED T YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE CASES SO THAT YOU COULD OR 'CAUSE OTHERWISE SOMEONE'S GONNA HAVE TO BUY A COMPLETE NEW REMOTE RATHER THAN JUST A CASE
OKAY
ONE ONE THING TO CONS ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT IN SOME WAYS YOU WANT UM BY HAVING A FAIRLY STANDARD CASE IT MEANS THEY CAN ALL FIT TOGETHER ON TOP OF EACH OTHER THEREFORE FOR STORAGE PURPOSES IN SHOPS AND THE LIKE AND IT MAKES IT EASIER THAT YOU CAN IF YOU CAN STORE THEM UP ON TOP OF EACH OTHER
WHEREAS IF YOU DO UM FANCY THINGS WITH IT YOU THEN GOTTA PUT IT IN A CA A A PACKAGING BOX THAT THAT DOES THAT
AND THE COST OF PACKAGING COULD BE QUITE IMPORTANT VIS A VIS THE TOTAL COST OF THE PRODUCT
SO BUT
NO
MM YEP
OH RIGHT
S SO DO YOU WANNA GO FOR CURVES MORE CURVES
WE'RE MEANT TO BE F WE'RE MEANT TO BE FINISHING THIS MEETING IN ABOUT A MINUTE OR SO
OKAY CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED
SO IT'S SINGLE CURVED
YEP
YES
YEP
SO WE'VE GOT SPONGY FEEL BUTTONS AS WELL HAVE WE
AS WELL AS OR W OR WAS THAT
SO IT'S RUBBER BUTTONS SO IT'S NOT REALLY SPONGY FEEL BUTTONS IT'S JUST RUBBER BUTTONS
WITH A RUBBER CASE RIGHT
AND THE STANDBY BUTTON IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT
OKAY SO WHAT WHAT SHAPE ARE WE MAKING THE STANDBY BUTTON
A APPLE
OH OH SORRY
A RED APPLE
IS IT
SORRY WHAT WAS THAT LAST THING AGAIN THERE
RIGHT MUCH OPTION ON THAT
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING FOR A SINGLE CURVE AND
ALRIGHT
RIGHT SO SHAPE OF BUTTONS SIMPLE
OKAY
SO THAT'S THAT I GUESS
WE SHOULD NOW GO AWAY AND GET THESE THINGS SORTED OUT
I GUESS YOU TWO ARE ON PLASTICINE DUTY OR WHATEVER
OKAY SO UM
OKAY
I THINK WE ALL HAVE A PRESENTATION AGAIN SO IF WE GO THROUGH THOSE AND THEN UM
SHALL I GO FIRST AGAIN
I SEE THIS A LITTLE MORE SMOOTHLY THAN THE LAST ONE
OKAY RIGHT LET'S GET STARTED
UM
BASICALLY THE UH FOR THE UM I'LL BACK ACTUALLY
FOR THE COMPONENTS DESIGN UM NEXT STEP IS BASICALLY THE THE WAY THE REMOTE'S GONNA WORK IS STILL THE SAME IDEA AS BEFORE
WE STILL HAVE THE USER INTERFACE WHICH IS ALL THE BUTTONS WE'RE GONNA INCORPORATE
THEN THERE IS A CHIP AND STILL THE SENDER
SO UM YES INCLUDING THE POWER S SUPPLY AS WELL
UM I'LL GO ON TO MY FINDINGS IN EACH OF THESE AREAS
UH FIRST IN THE POWER SUPPLY WE HAVE THE OPTION OF JUST THE STANDARD BATTERY
UM
THERE'S A DYNAMO
ANY OF YOU THINK OF KIND OF LIKE THE THE OLD TORCHES WHICH YOU WIND UP UM
THERE'S A KINETIC OPTION WHICH IF ANY OF YOU'VE SEEN THOSE NEW WATCHES WHICH YOU KIND OF YOU POWER UP BY WAVING AROUND
UM IT JUST REQUIRES A SMALL AMOUNT OF MOVEMENT WHICH WOULD MEAN THE BATTERIES WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE REPLACED
UM THAT'S ONE OPTION BUT I THINK THAT WAS GONNA COST A LITTLE MORE
AND THEN THERE'S SOLAR CELLS
UM AS A FINAL OPTION
FOR THE BUTTONS WE HAVE UM AN INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON WHICH IS OH JUST TO SAY ALL ALL THESE ARE UM SUPPLIED BY REAL REACTION
SO I GUESS FOR THE EASE OF FOR QUICKNESS AND EASE WE SHOULD TAKE THEM FROM AT LEAST LIKE ONE OF THESE OPTIONS
UM SO FOR THE BUTTONS THERE'S AN INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON WHICH I GUESS IS JUST THE SAME AS THE STANDARD ONES
THIS SAYS IT'S UH SIMILAR TO UH THE BUTTON ON THE MOUSE FOR A NORMAL FOR LIKE UH LIKE MODERN COMPUTER
UM THERE'S A SCROLL WHEEL
WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE NEW MOUSE HAS JUST GOT LIKE THE CENTRE SECTION WHICH YOU CAN SCROLL UP AND DOWN WHICH MAY BE FOR THE VOLUME
YOU COULD DO DO THAT
UM ONE ISSUE FOR THE BUTTONS IS DEPENDING ON WHICH MATERIAL WE USE
IF WE USE RUBBER BUTTONS THEN IT REQUIRES A RUBBER CASE SO WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION
UM MOVING ON TO THE PRINTED S
UM THAT'S ON THE NEXT I TH I THINK THE THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE COST
THAT THAT RELATED TO THE ACTUAL BUTTONS BUT IT DOES AFFECT THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD
UM WHICH IS THE NEXT SECTION
BASICALLY FOR THE CIRCUIT BOARD WHICH IS THE MIDDLE IT'S JUST SEE IT DOWN THERE THE CHIPS LIKE THE LIKE THE WORKINGS OF THE ACTUAL UM OF THE REMOTE
THE FIRM SUPPLIES A SIMPLE A REGULAR AND AN ADVANCED UM CIRCUIT BOARD
AND THERE'S DIFFERENT PRICES ACCORDING TO EACH
SO IF WE'VE GOT THE SCROLL WHEEL FOR ONE OF THE BUTTONS
THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SLIGHTLY MORE ADVANCED CIRCUIT BOARD THAN IF WE JUST HAD A STANDARD UM PUSH BUTTON
UM ONE FINAL THING WE CAME UP WITH WAS SOME INFORMATION ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
THERE'S A SMALL UNIT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE COMPANY UM WHICH OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE AN EXTRA COST BUT IT WOULDN'T AFFECT THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE TOO MUCH
UM AND I GUESS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A MORE ADVANCED CIRCUIT BOARD SO THERE IS AN EXTRA PRICE IN THAT SENSE
THERE IS TH SORRY AN EXTRA COST IN THAT SENSE
UM GOING TO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
UM I THOUGHT POSSIBLY FOR POWER WE COULD USE KINETIC UM WHICH IS THE IDEA OF THE WATCHES UM THAT YOU MOVE YOU MOVE THE REMOTE AROUND TO POWER IT UP
AND THIS WOULD AVOID BATTERIES RUNNING OUT HAVING TO REPLACE BATTERIES AND SUCH LIKE
UM FOR THE BUTTONS I THOUGHT WE'D PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH JUST HAVING THE STANDARD UM PUSH BUTTONS RATHER THAN THE SCROLL WHEEL
UM AND FOR THE CIRCUIT BOARD AGAIN DEPENDS ON WHICH FEATURES WE WANT IN THE ACTUAL IN THE REMOTE
SO IF WE WANTED THE SCROLL WHEEL AND WANTED THE VOICE RECOGNITION UM THEN WE'D HAVE TO GET A A MORE COSTLY CIRCUIT BOARD
AND THAT'S IT
UM I IT KIND OF DEPENDS UM IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WE'D HAVE TO PROBABLY GET AN ADVANCED ONE
I'M GUESSING
UH BUT I DON'T KNOW SO THAT IS SOMETHING I'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO
UM THAT'S A THAT'S A DECISION FOR ALL OF US
UM
YEAH YEAH
WE DECIDE
YEAH
UM
MAYBE W
UM
YES
IS THERE
UM
WE COULD DO YEAH
UM YEAH WE SHOULD
AS I SAY IT ONLY SPECIFIED THAT WE NEED A MORE ADVANCED CIRCUIT BOARD FOR THE SCROLL WHEEL
IT DIDN'T THE VOICE RECOGNITION CAME AS A SEPARATE PIECE OF INFORMATION
UM
YEAH IF IF YOU DOWN UM
IT'S JUST THIS BIT AT THE BOTTOM WHICH I'VE HIGHLIGHTED
BUT THE SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES A MINI M MINIMALLY A REGULAR CHIP WHICH IS IN THE HIGHER PRICE RANGE
ALSO THE DISPLAY'S FOR SOMETHING ELSE WHICH WE DECIDED AGAINST
UM BUT THAT BIT
AND NOTE THAT THE PUSH BUTTON JUST REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP SO THAT WOULD KEEP THE PRICE DOWN
'KAY
SO MAYBE JUST A SIMPLE PUSH BUTTON AND THAT WOULD CUT COSTS ON THE
DID EVERYONE GET THIS ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
THE UM IT WAS BASICALLY WHAT WE SAID BEFORE THE IDEA THAT YOU RECORD IN A SET
MESSAGE AND THEN IT PICKS UP THAT MESSAGE UM AND REPLIES TO YOU
SO IT IS BASICALLY THE CONCEPT WE DISCUSSED BEFORE
UM BUT THEN WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER IT WOULD REQUIRE A MORE COMPLICATED CIRCUIT BOARD
I'M GUESSING IT WOULD BUT GOT LIKE THE DEFINITE INFORMATION
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO ON WHAT WE'RE CERTAIN OF RATHER THAN
UM IF IT'S JUST THE PUSH BUTTON THEN IT JUST NEEDS THE SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD
SO MAYBE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING SEPARATE YEAH
OKAY SO WE'D HAVE A SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD AND THAT WOULD BE AN EXTRA THAT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO IT
OH THAT MAKES SENSE
OKAY
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE SO WE'D STICK WITH THE SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD AND THEN THINK OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AS AN EXTRA
AN EXTRA POSSIBILITY
OKAY
UM
UM YEAH I I THOUGHT SO JUST FOR JUST FOR EASE OF NOT HAVING TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES
UM
IT'S UM I THINK IT WORKS ON THE BASIS THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF BALL BEARINGS INSIDE
IT'S UM IT'S SOME ON WATCHES WHICH YOU YOU KIND OF YOU SHAKE TO POWER IT UP
SOMEHOW THE MECHANISM INSIDE POWERS UP THROUGH MOVEMENT
SO YOU'D YOU'D MOVE THE REMOTE AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THAT POWERS IT UP TO USE IT
UH YEAH I THINK DID WE DECIDE IT DIDN'T AFFECT THE CIRCUIT BOARD IT JUST AFFECTED
IT WAS JUST
OH NO TH THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT BUT MAYBE MAYBE IT DOESN'T
UM I THINK I MIGHT HAVE GOT THAT WRONG
IT'S IT'S JUST AN ADDITION THING IT'S UM YEAH
'KAY
'KAY SHALL I PASS ON TO YOU NOW
I ASSUME IT WOULD COST EXTRA BUT
MAYBE WE MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUT HOW MUCH THAT DOES COST AND HAVE TO DECIDE SLIGHTLY LATER
IF YOU RIGHT CLICK AND THEN GO ONTO A PREVIOUS SLIDE
OKAY RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
ON THE PRICE YEAH
'KAY
I GUESS I GUESS WE'RE GOING FOR THE BIGGEST MARKET MAYBE NOT BUT
WAS IT WAS IT SPECIFIED THAT WE WENT FOR THE BIGGEST
SO MAYBE THE CHILDREN'S REMOTE SHOULD BE LIKE A A NEXT STEP BUT MAYBE I DUNNO FOR OURS MAYBE WE SHOULD
YEAH
SO YOU ALSO SAID FOR GOING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET UM THAT SOME SOME MAYBE OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
S S SO UM
YEAH YEAH
IT W IT WOULD MAKE IT QUITE COMPLICATED WHERE UM OURS AT LEAST KEEPS IT FAIRLY SIMPLE AND THEN THE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YES YES
SO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE LIKE
YEAH
YEAH I I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
SO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE VOLUME WRITTEN ON THE SIDE AND THEN UP AND DOWN ON THE ON THE BUTTONS THEMSELVES
POSSIBLE
MM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WE GOT IT DOWN TO NOT TOO MANY
UM
ARE WE ARE WE GONNA GO THROUGH THE DESIGN OF ALL THE BUTTONS AT THE MOMENT OR ARE WE GONNA T
YEAH MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE YOURS FIRST
'KAY
WELL I DUNNO I I GUESS MAYBE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES MAY BE POPULAR AT THE MOMENT BUT AS WE KNOW HOW FICKLE THE FASHION MARKETS ARE MAYBE
I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS REALISTIC THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET ISN'T THE KIND OF THING WHICH TAKES IN
THOSE KINDS OF FASHION TRENDS
TO SOMETHING WHICH IS MAYBE MORE UNIVERSAL
WE C MAYBE CAN IMPLY A FRUIT SHAPE POSSIBLY
MAYBE THE SPONGY FEEL IS SOMETHING WE COULD THINK ABOUT UM
MAYBE STILL WITH A RUBBER DESIGN WE COULD
UM
OH YEAH YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS WERE IF YOU HAD RUBBER BUTTONS THEN YOU HAD TO HAVE A RUBBER CASE
UM OH NO NO NO SORRY IT'S IF YOU USE THE UH RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE THEN YOU MUST USE RUBBER BUTTONS
THAT'S THE WAY ROUND
IF YOU HAVE THE RUBBER CASE THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RUBBER BUTTONS TO GO WITH IT
WHICH MAKES SENSE
UM
YEAH
I SUPPOSE WE MAYBE ARE LIMITED IN THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE TO PUT THE LOGO ON THE ACTUAL WOULD OR NOT
YEAH
YES YES
MAYBE WE COULD THINK OF THE THE CASES LIKE CHANGING WITH THE FASHIONS LIKE THE NOKIA PHONES WHERE YOU COULD TAKE THE CASING OFF THE OUTSIDE
BUT WHETHER THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO INCORPORATE IN PRODUCTION WHETHER THAT WOULD JUST INCREASE THE COSTS MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED
YEAH THE A THE ACTUAL THE SORT OF THE LOOK FROM THE OUTSIDE SO WHERE THE BUTTONS WOULD STAY THE SAME
AND THE GENERAL FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE WOULD STAY THE SAME BUT YOU COULD CHANGE THE THE WAY IT LOOKED
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
SO IT IS A POSSIBILITY UM
OH OKAY YES THAT IS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND WHETHER WE'D HAVE A BIG ENOUGH MARKET TO HAVE THIS KIND OF LIKE SECONDARY MARKET OF SELLING THE CASES
MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER
YEAH
YEAH I SUPPOSE WHERE YOU YOU KEEP THE REMOTE HIDDEN UNDER THE SOFA MOST OF THE TIME
YEAH LESS LIKELY TO
SO THEN TH TH THAT WOULD
YEAH
IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE THAT WE WE'D JUST MAYBE STICK WITH THE STANDARD RUBBER CASE AND THEN HAVE THE STANDARD RUBBER BUTTONS AS WELL
UM
UM
MAYB
MAYBE CURVES GIVE IT LIKE THE SLIGHTLY MORE AESTHETIC FEEL
BUT THE DOUBLE CURVE WOULDN'T REQUIRE US TO PERFORM MIRACLES WITH THE PLASTICINE
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
SO SHALL WE GO THROUGH QUICKLY AND JUST WORK OUT WHAT WE'VE DECIDE ON IF WE HAVE TO KIND OF
'KAY SO SHALL WE QUICKLY
WE'LL GO FOR SINGLE CURVE YEAH
SINGLE CURVE
SO DID WE DID WE DECIDE ON THE KINETIC POWER SUPPLY
THE ONE YOU MOVE AROUND
OKAY
UM
OH WE CA YEAH YEAH WE'LL STILL HAVE THE ARE WE GONNA GO FOR THE SIMPLE CIRCUIT BOARD JUST TO KEEP THE COST DOWN
I TH I THINK WE CAN BY BY NOT HAVING ANYTHING TOO COMPLICATED
UM
UM
AND SEE WE COULD ALWAYS DECIDE AGAINST IT IF SOMETHING COMES UP THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THAT WE SEEMED TO LEAVE OUT
YEAH IT WAS JUST
'KAY
WE WILL GO FOR THE A A A APPLES APPLES
OKAY
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ARE YOU GONNA WORK ON KEEPING THE BUTTON DESIGN QUITE SIMPLE
JUST LIKE THE
JUST WORKING OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR THE NEXT TIME
UM
YEAH
'KAY
AND J YEAH JUST KEEPING THE SORT OF THE LABELLING THEM LABELLING OF THEM FAIRLY SIMPLE AS WELL
FAIRLY SORT OF SELF EXPLANATORY
OKAY
IS THAT THE END
OKAY
THANKS
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY A BETTER ONE TO DISCUSS IT STRAIGHT AWAY
UM I HAVE A LOT OF THE INFORMATION THERE
IT MIGHT NOT BE VERY CLEAR
UNLESS YOU WANT TO PLUG IT BACK IN TO YOURS
I THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL UM
YEAH AND IF WE'RE GOING FOR SLEEK AND SEXY I THINK A SCROLL WHEEL IS MAYBE A BIT KINDA BULKY
I I'VE GOT UM PICTURES WELL I'VE SEEN PICTURES WITH IT KIND OF STICKING OFF THE SIDE OF IT AND THEY DON'T REALLY LOOK GREAT
YEAH A SIMPLE PUSHBUTTONS
HMM
BUT
BUT THE WAY THAT I INTERPRET THAT UM IT DOESN'T SEEM TO SEND OUT A SIGNAL TO THE TELLY
IT JUST IT'S LIKE A PARROT JUST REP REPLY REPLYING TO YOUR MESSAGE
SO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD EFFECT OUR CIRCUIT BOARD
YEAH
AND I DON'T THINK YOU COULD REALLY PERFORM ANY OF THE REMOTE FUNCTIONS WITH IT
'CAUSE THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY'VE GIVEN THERE IS GOOD MORNING COFFEE MACHINE GOOD MORNING JO
IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO SAY LIKE WHERE ARE YOU REMOTE
HERE I AM JO
BUT I THINK THAT'S MAYBE AS FAR AS THAT ONE COULD GO
YEAH JUST AS A FUN WAY TO FIND IT
AND IT SAYS THAT I THINK IT SAID THE COST OF THAT ISN'T TOO MUCH
UM I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO FIND IT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'D UM
YEAH I THINK SO
MM-HMM
I THINK
I'LL JUST JUST CHECK WHAT IT SAID
ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK IT REALLY SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT THE COST BUT IT SAYS THAT IT'S ALREADY IN THE COFFEE MACHINES SO
LIKE IT'S ALREADY KIND OF
UM
OH THAT WAS QUICK
UM OKAY SO VERY BRIEF PRESENTATION UM
FROM LOOKING AT THE REMOTES THAT ARE OUT THERE AT THE MINUTE NONE OF THEM ARE PARTICULARLY UM SLEEK AND SEXY
UM I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT THE EXAMPLES OF THE SCROLL BUTTON THERE UM BUT THERE'S SOME CURVED CASES THAT YOU CAN SEE UH A RANGE OF SIZES UH
ALL OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS THERE UM THEY SEEM TO JUST HAVE THE RUBBER BUTTONS
DOES THAT MOVE IT
IT JUST SEEMS TO BE SKIPPING ON WITHOUT US DOING ANYTHING
AH IT'S ALRIGHT
UM
THERE WASN'T MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT JUST RAMBLING
UM SOME OF THE UH REMOTES THAT I LOOKED AT ONE OF THE MODELS DA DID ACTUALLY HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION WHERE YOU COULD UM
WHERE IT WAS CONNECTED TO THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
AND UH IT WAS QUITE UH A SWISH MODEL WHERE IT CAN CONTROL UH FOUR DEVICES T. V. CABLE SATELLITE VIDEO D. V. D. AUDIO
UM SO THAT'S A BIT OF COMPETITION THERE
SO
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S BETTER NOT TO TRY AND COMPETE WITH THAT SORT OF THING AND JUST TO MARKET IT AS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT UM
LIKE DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT AS A KIND OF FINDING YOUR LOST CONTROL RATHER THAN TRYING TO COMPETE WITH THE FUNCTIONS
UM THE SCROLL BUTTONS AS YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED UM
THERE'S EXAMPLES OF THOSE BUT THEY DON'T LOOK AS SLEEK AS OTHER MODELS
AND THERE'S NO REAL ADVANTAGE AND BECAUSE IT IMPACTS ON OTHER ON THE MATERIALS AND THE PRICE IT'S NOT GREAT
UM
YEAH
TH THERE WAS A SPECIALIST TYPE OF REMOTE THAT WE COULD THINK ABOUT UM
THERE WAS CHILDREN'S REMOTE
WHERE UM THEY JUST HAD A VERY LIMITED RANGE OF BUTTONS AND THEY WERE B UH BRIGHT AND COLOURFUL AND UM YOU YOU COULD PROGRAM THEM SO THAT THEY COULD ONLY LOOK AT CERTAIN CHANNELS
UM BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S REALLY IN OUR FIELD
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S OUT THERE
HMM
HMM
OKAY
RIGHT WELL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BE AWARE OF
UM
I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY UM VERY GOOD VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE
AND BECAUSE OURS MIGHT NOT COVER THE SAME FUNCTIONS THAT THE LEADING BRANDS DO IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO MARKET IT AS A UM FINDER FUNCTION
YEAH
OH YEAH
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES MIGHT NOT BE COMPATIBLE
HMM
YEAH 'CAUSE I THINK YOU PROGRAM UM THIS ONE YOURSELF LIKE TO SAY LIKE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO YOUR QUESTION
HMM
MAYBE UNLESS SOMETHING ELSE COMES UP
UM YEAH I THINK UM I THINK WE'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S GONNA INCREASE THE COST AND GIVE NO REAL KINDA EXTRA BENEFIT AND IT'S GONNA DECREASE FROM THE SLEEKNESS OF IT
HMM UM AND JUST TO BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE KIND OF SPECIALIST FUNCTIONS AND SPECIALIST REMOTES BUT WE PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THOSE LIKE SUCH AS THE CHILDREN'S REMOTE
YEAH
UM THERE WAS A MENTION JUST AS KIND OF A WARNING ABOUT BUTTON DESIGN
UM JUST TO AVOID AMBIGUITY
SO IT GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF SAY YOUR VOLUME BUTTONS FOR UP AND DOWN THEY MIGHT BOTH HAVE A V. ON FOR VOLUME
UM LET'S THINK HOW THEY DID THIS
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK SO I DO THIS RIGHT
UM
WHAT DID THEY SAY
UM I THINK THE THING WAS THAT IF YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS TO HAVE TRIANGULAR BUTTONS
UM SOMEBODY MIGHT LOOK AT THIS ONE AND SAY OH WELL THIS TRIANGULAR BUTTON IS POINTING UP AND THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT THEY SEE
ACTUALLY THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT CAN IT
OH WELL NO THEY MIGHT SEE
YEAH THEY MIGHT SEE THIS POINTING DOWN AND THINK RIGHT THAT'S GONNA TURN THE VOLUME DOWN
WHEREAS THE ACTUAL BUTTON'S POINTING UP SO THE FUNCTION IS TO TURN THE BUTTON UP
SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PUT ON THE BUTTONS AND BE CAREFUL OF THE SHAPE THAT YOU MAKE THEM BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE KIND OF TWO UM
CONTRADICTING KIND OF SHAPES
YEAH
UM AND I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY FOR THAT
UM SO WHAT WAS THE DECISION ON THE UM DESIGN OF THE VOLUME BUTTON
OH OKAY
I THINK IF YOU START MAKING THE BUTTONS FRUIT SHAPED IT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED TO USE
YEAH
MAYBE JUST ONE BUTTON SAY THE STANDBY BUTTON IS QUITE KINDA SEPARATE FROM ALL THE OTHER FUNCTIONS
MAYBE THAT COULD BE A LITTLE APPLE
AND THEN THAT WOULDN'T GET IN THE WAY OF LIKE KINDA ONE TO NINE AND IT WOULDN'T CONFUSE THE NUMBERS
HMM
S
BUT I SUPPOSE AS LONG AS IT'S QUITE A SUBTLE DESIGN UM EVEN IF THE DESIGN KIND OF CHANGES
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE RUBBER CASES AS WELL AS BUTTONS
AND THAT YOU CAN MAKE THEM CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED AND THAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF SLEEK AND SEXY LOOK
OH RIGHT THAT FITS DOESN'T IT
RIGHT
AND THAT WOULD FIT IN WITH WHAT WE WANT WOULDN'T IT FOR THE SPONGY FEEL TO HAVE EVERYTHING RUBBER
HMM
YEAH AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE OH BUT YOU STILL WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE LOGO ON EVERY NEW CASE
BUT YOU COULD HAVE LIKE PINK CASES FOR GIRLS AND RED ONES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
HMM
BUT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO USE THE UM COMPANY COLOUR SCHEME AREN'T WE
WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT YET
IT MIGHT AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO BOTH BUT IT MIGHT CLASH WITH CERTAIN THINGS
HMM
WELL IF IT'S FOR YOUNG PEOPLE UM LIKE THE PHONE GENERATION
THAT SORT OF THING'D PROBABLY GO DOWN WELL AND THE MARKET RESEARCH HAS BEEN ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS HASN'T IT
OKAY SO IF WE JUST WENT FOR ONE COLOUR OF A RUBBER CASE
DID WE DECIDE ON THE RUBBER CASE
THE SPONGY FEEL OR DID WE THINK THAT THAT MIGHT GO AS A TREND
UH WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT UH THE CURVATURE OF THE CASE
THERE'S FLAT THERE'S SINGLE CURVED AND THERE'S DOUBLE CURVED
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THESE THINGS LOOK LIKE
WELL IT SAYS THAT
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
UM I'LL SHOW YOU
THE REMOTES THAT I'VE GOT
SEE HOW UH
LET'S JUST GET THAT BIGGER
SEE HOW UH THE ONE OH I'M NOT PLUGGED IN AM I
THAT DOESN'T HELP
SHALL I JUST TURN IT ROUND FOR TIME
HMM
UM IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR UP THERE BUT YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THEM HAVE GOT KIND OF BULGES
LIKE THE SECOND ONE AND THE END ONE UH WHERE THERE'S A CURVE THERE
I'M NOT EXACTL I DON'T KNOW IF A DOUBLE CURVE IS MAYBE IT COMES UP SLIGHTLY OR
BUT UM IT IS A KINDA SLEEKER LOOK IF YOU'VE GOT CURVES IN THERE
DEFINITELY A SINGLE MAYBE A DOUBLE
SHALL WE GO FOR SINGLE CURVE JUST TO COMPROMISE
YEAH
AND THE RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS RUBBER CASE
UM AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE COLOUR SCHEME OR LOGO YET DO WE BUT POSSIBLY A STICKER
YEAH
YEAH AND AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE CAN USE THAT CAN'T WE JUST TO FIND IT
WITHOUT AFFECTING THE CIRCUIT BOARD
YEAH THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULDN'T DO TOO MUCH HARM IN A COUPLE OF YEARS
UH WHAT SORT OF SHAPE DO WE WANT
YEAH SO IT'S NOT TOO WACKY
UM I THINK AN APPLE WOULD BE A GOOD RECOGNISABLE SHAPE
IF YOU START GETTING INTO KINDA AUBERGINES AND THINGS IT GETS A BIT WEIRD
VOTE
SHALL WE VOTE ON IT
ANYONE GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS
RIGHT
OKAY
AH
WELL IT COULD BE RED
YEAH 'CAUSE WE WANNA INCORPORATE A BIT OF COLOUR IF WE CAN ONCE WE FIND OUT UM
YEAH
YEAH THAT SEEMS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD
'CAUSE MOST OF THEM WILL JUST BE KIND OF MAINLY CIRCULAR OR LIKE VERY PLAIN
UH JUST TO KEEP THE SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS SIMPLE
AH JUST THE UH SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
'KAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO ARE WE GOING FOR THE W ARE WE GOING FOR THE SIMPLE ONE ARE WE
OKAY
YEAH
MM
I SUPPOSE WE NEED WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT CIRCUIT BOARD THAT REQUIRES MAYBE BEFORE WE M MAKE A DECISION
OH YEAH I SUPPOSE SO YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
JUST
JUST JUST FOR THE CALL AND FIND THING
'CAUSE IT'S S IT'S SEPARATE ISN'T IT IT'S NOT PART OF THE
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH AND OURS IS QUITE A CHEAP DEVICE SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT INTO IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
I'VE I'VE GOT SOME THINGS TO SAY ABOUT POSSIBLE DESIGN THINGS FROM
TREND WATCHING
COOL
RIGHT UM I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME TRENDS
IN IN SORT OF BASICALLY FASHION ON TOP OF DOING THE UM RESEARCH INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET THE THE ONE THAT'S THE ONE I TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME
THAT WE'D SORT OF ASKED PEOPLE ABOUT REMOTE CONTROLS AND WHAT WHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THEM WHAT WAS BAD WHAT THEY USED
AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN LOOKING AT SORT OF FA SORT OF FASHIONS AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE WANTING OUT OF CONSUMER GOODS AT THE MOMENT
SO WE'VE HAD PEOPLE IN PARIS AND MILAN WATCHING THE UH FASHION TRENDS
SO
SO JUST TO SUMMARISE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WHICH CAME OUT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET INVESTIGATION
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS THAT THE THING SORT OF LOOK AND FELT FANCY RATHER THAN JUST FUNCTIONAL
AND SECOND THERE SHOULD BE SOME TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
AND THEN THIRD AND L LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER TWO THERE SHOULD BE AN EASE OF USE AS WELL
AND APPARENTLY THE FASHION TRENDS ARE THAT PEOPLE WANT SORT OF CLOTHES AND SHOES AND THINGS WITH A FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THEME
UM BUT UM THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL SHOULD BE SPONGY WHICH IS CONTRARY TO LAST YEAR APPARENTLY
I PRESUME IT MUST HAVE BEEN NOT NOT SPONGY LAST YEAR
SO
WE NEED TO EMPHASISE THE FANCY DESIGN WITH ON ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL ABOVE ALL ELSE
AND THEN ALSO TRY AND ADD IN TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMAT INNOVATION WHICH COULD BE OUR SORT OF FIND THE THING WITH A HAND CLAP
AND THEN WE NEED TO MA SORT OF MAKE IT EASY TO USE THAT'S AS A THIRD PRIORITY
SO PERHAPS UM FEWER FEWER BUTTONS AND FUNCTIONS AS WE'VE AS WE'VE DISCUSSED
AND THEN MAYBE FIND A WAY TO INCORPORATE THESE TRENDS SO THAT WE SORT OF CAPTURE PEOPLE'S IMAGINATIONS
SO MAYBE WE COULD MAKE THE BUTTONS SHAPED LIKE FRUIT AND VEG OR THE THE BUTTONS COULD BE SPONGY UH SOMEHOW
MAYBE WE COULD MAKE THEM OUT OF RUBBER RATHER THAN SORT OF HARD PLASTIC
AND THEN SORT OF EVEN WACKIER THAN THAT WE COULD MAYBE HAVE A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE SHAPED REMOTE
SAY IN THE SHAPE OF A BANANA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
RIGHT SO THAT'LL BE IT
MAYBE A BANANA OR COURGETTE OR SOMETHING
HOW HOW FAR WE ACTUALLY WANT TO GO ALONG AND SORT OF FOLLOW THE TRENDS
DO WE THINK THE TRENDS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THIS TYPE OF GADGET OR OR YOU KNOW DO THEY NOT MATTER THAT MUCH
YEAH
MAYBE YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH I'M NOT
YEAH
I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE WHAT WHAT WHAT THE SORT OF TIMESCALE WE'RE THINKING OF SELLING THE PRODUCT OVER IS
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THAT'S POSSIBLY IT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN IT'S PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THE LOOK THEY WANT THE FANCY LOOKING THING BUT I'M
YEAH
I'M NOT CONVINCED ON WHETHER HAVING CHANGEABLE COVERS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD BUY INTO
I THINK WITH THE MOBILES
IT'S THE YOU KNOW IT'S A COMMUNICATION DEVICE PEOPLE SEE YOU WITH IT ALL ABOUT AND
I IF IT
YEAH
I THINK
MM-HMM
WELL IT WAS DIFFERENT LAST YEAR
THE TREND WAS DIFFERENT LAST YEAR APPARENTLY
IT WAS NOT NOT SPONGY FEEL
BUT
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE TREND WILL CHANGE
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT
LIKE SORT OF HAVING ALL FRUIT SHAPED KEYS THAT THAT PROBABLY WOULD GO OUT OF FASHION VERY QUICKLY
WHEREAS JUST THE FACT THAT IT WAS A RUBBER CASE IS PROBABLY LESS LESS OF SOMETHING THAT
Y YOU'RE GONNA END UP HATING IN A YEAR YOU KNOW
YEAH
MM
OKAY
WHEN YOU SAY D WHEN YOU SAY DOUBLE CURVED WHAT WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN
OKAY
NO YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED TO ME ANYMORE
THAT SHOULD COME UP
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
RIGHT
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO WORK OUT
SHALL WE
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH I THINK THAT THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
RUBBER
RUBBER BUTTONS AND CASE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
AND THEN ARE WE GOING FOR SORT OF ONE BUTTON SHAPED LIKE A FRUIT
OR VEG
DON'T KNOW MAYBE JUST
YEAH
THAT'S RU RUBBER BUTTONS YEAH
YEAH
REASONABLY SPONGY I GUESS YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
APPLE
YEAH
YEAH
APPLE APPLE A A QU QUITE A BIG ONE AS WELL
A BIG APPLE
UH
COULD BE A RED APPLE YEAH
EITHER DON'T MIND
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
LOOKS LIKE IT
SO IS WHY NOT SAVE THAT
DO YOU WANT TO REPLACE EXISTING FILE NO
I ACTUALLY TRIED TO TRANSFER IT TO MY DOCUMENTS BUT
SPREADSHEET
YEAH BUT I'VE TA UH RIGHT I'LL JUST RE DO IT
THAT'S THE EASIEST WAY
RIGHT
R RIGHT
UM ALL THESE THINGS HAVE COST IMPLICATIONS
AND SO WHEN I DONE MY THING ON COST A I HAD ASSUMED THAT THE ONLY UH BUTTON THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT COLOUR WOULD BE THE UH THE RED APPLE BUTTON
SO HOWEVER I'VE NOW
BUT UM YEAH SO UH BUT THERE WOULD BE A COST IMPLICATION ON THAT
AND UH AS I SUPPOSE THAT SO WHETHER WANTED TO PUT IN ALL THESE COLOURS WOULD BE UH OPEN TO DEBATE I SUPPOSE
AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION
RIGHT OKAY SO UM
AND THE SECOND ONE UNDERNEATH WOULD BE THE IDEA FOR THE
RIGHT OKAY
SO WE'VE GOT UM DETAIL DESIGN MEETING
RIGHT
SO SO WE'VE GOT
PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION WHICH WE'VE JUST DONE EVALUATION CRITERIA UM AND FINANCE
SO I GUESS W WE HAVE TO EVALUATE IF THAT MEETS THE VARIOUS UH ASPECTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR UH FROM UM OUR PREVIOUS MEETING
SO OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SECOND LAYER BUT UM OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD
BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE GOT THE RED APPLE
WE GOT THE BUTTONS AND THE ONLY THING THAT HAS REALLY CHANGED IS THE IS THE COLOURATION OF THE BUTTONS
AND THE BIT AFTER THE EVALUATION CRITERIA IS UH IS THE FINANCE
AND THE AND THE COST IMPLICATION
THE ONLY SNAG ABOUT THIS IS THAT UH
THE COST IS PROBABLY KIND OF IMPORTANT
SO UM AND THEN THE PRODUCTION EVALUATION AS TO HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE TO UH TO MANUFACTURE
UM
AND WHETHER IT WOULD UH
RIGHT
SO UH AS FAR AS THE THE FINANCE OF IT WOULD BE CONCERN WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COST AYE THE PRODUCTION COST 'CAUSE YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST UH CONSIDERATIONS WAS TO BE IN D UNDER UM UH TWELVE FIFTY OR TWO AND A HALF UH TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
SO THERE'S NO REDESIGN
SO THAT SHOULD UH RIGHT SO SEEMS TO ME THAT THE THING THAT I HAVE TO DO IS
IS QUICKLY FIND THAT UH
RIGHT
OKAY
RIGHT
OKAY SO BY THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT UH THE SIMPLE CHIP AND THE UH KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE WE'VE GOT A SINGLE CURVED
CASE
WE'VE GOT A RUBBER UH CASE MATERIALS SUPPLEMENTS
SO WE HAD DECIDED THAT WE'RE HAVING RUBBER BUTTONS AND
OKAY
W THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
WELL ORIGINALLY I THOUGHT THERE WOULD JUST BE UH ONE IN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONE RED APPLE
BUT SO THE SO THE REAL W THE REAL QUESTION THEN WOULD COME IN
DO YOU MAKE ALL THE BUTTONS
O
WELL SO WE'VE GOT ONE SPECIAL BUTTON FORM WHICH WAS THE APPLE
EVERYTHING ELSE IS GONNA BE A STANDARD
WE'VE GOT SPECIAL MATERIAL RUBBER WOOD TITANIUM ET CETERA AND THAT SO I WAS ORIGINALLY
I WAS THINKING RUBBER WASN'T SPECIAL BUT ACCORDING TO THIS MAYBE IT IS
SO
AND THE R I MEAN EFFECTIVELY WE'VE GOT SIXTEEN BUTTONS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE ON THERE
W I DON'T KNOW IS IS IS THE SORT OF ANSWER IS THAT MEANT TO BE ALL SIXTEEN BUTTONS AND THEREFORE I MEAN
WHAT'S THE OP THE OPTION WAS MAYBE NOT TO HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS BUT JUST TO HAVE THE ONE THAT WAS SOFT AND SPONGY AND THEREFORE
WHEREAS IT WOULD BE THE SPECIAL COLOUR WOULD BE FOR THE SO YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE THE ONE SPECIAL BUTTON THAT WAS RUBBER
WHEREAS THE REST WOULD BE HARD PLASTIC
MM
I WOULD EVERY DESIGN CHANGE IS UH I DUNNO UM OKAY UM
IF WE JUST HAD ALL THE BUTTONS AS STANDARD EXCEPT FOR THE ONE RED APPLE THEN THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT I GUESS
WE'D HAVE ONE SPECIAL COLOUR AND ONE SPECIAL BUTTON FORM
AND WHEN
I PLUGGED THAT IN LAST TIME REMEMBER IT HAS TO BE UNDER TWELVE AND A HALF
AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT UM THAT TOOK CARE OF THE UH OF THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS
AND IF WHAT HAPPENED
NOW RIGHT
OKAY SO BUT THE POINT WOULD BE THAT IF WE UH
IF WE JUST DID SPECIAL SORRY YOU WERE SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE THAT ONE THAT YOU WOULD PUT IN ONE THERE
OKAY
SO IT WELL IS IT S IS NO IT'S NINE POINT SEVEN I'VE GOT
OKAY
SO THAT WOULD
THAT WOULD WORK OUT FINE IF UH
UH AS ASSUMING YOUR CORRECTION ARE ARE ASSUMING THAT THAT ONE CHANGE COVERS ALL THE BUTTONS THEN THAT WOULD BE FINE
AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THAT WE WE HAD UH PLANNED TO PUT ON
UH-HUH
WELL HOLD ON
UM IF WE
OKAY THAT GIVES US TWELVE POINT SEVEN
BUT REMEMBER THAT THE IDEA WAS TO KEEP IT THE COLOUR OF THE OH I SEE SO JUST TAKE OUT THE SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE APPLE AND
AND GO FOR BATTERY INSTEAD
THAT WOULD GIVE YOU ONE LESS
BUT YOU RECKON THAT I I MEAN THE THING IS THAT YOU WANTED TO A APPEAL TO PEOPLE AND NOT HAVE TO REPLACE BATTERIES
MM-HMM
BUT WHICH DO YOU THINK OR WHICH DO WE THINK IS THE MORE IMPORTANT OF THE OPTIONS
IN A SENSE AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT A TOTAL WHICH WE NEED TO REDUCE DOWN BY ONE POINT TWO
AT LEAST
REMEMBER THAT WAS A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT
THE OTHER OPTION IF WE'RE PLANNING ON JUST GOING FOR SOMETHING CHEAP AND CHEERFUL WOULD BE TO UM MAKE IT ORIGINALLY WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT A SIMPLE PRODUCT
MM-HMM
MAKES SENSE
SORRY DO YOU WANT THAT BACK UP
RIGHT
OKAY BUT REMEMBER THE MAIN THE ONLY REASON WE WERE PLANNING ON HAVING THE VOICE RECOGNITION WAS SO THAT THEY COULD FIND THE REMOTE IF IT GOT LOST
GO FOR ONE
YEP
OKAY
YEAH WHY NOT NOT M M MAYBE NEARER THREE
TWO THREE
WELL IT'S JUST THAT UH SAYING SOMETHING REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN WE'VE GOT SOLAR POWER
WE'VE GOT UH VARIOUS OTHER THINGS YOU COULD HAVE AND WE'RE NOT GOING FOR THESE OPTIONS
MM-HMM
OKAY
NO
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT W WE TOOK THAT OUT TOO
DIDN'T YOU
OR
WELL WAIT A MINUTE
IN THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN WE DO HAVE KINETIC
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE TO REDUCE DOWN FROM THERE TO GET IT DOWN TO TWELVE POINT FIVE
AND ONE WAY OF DOING THAT WOULD BE TO TAKE OUT THE KINETIC
SO IT'S VERY MUCH DEPENDANT ON WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR OPTIONS
AND IF YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING FOR THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER
THEN BECAUSE THAT THE OTHER FUNCTIONS WE'VE GOT IN ARE ARE MORE AT THE THE SPECIAL MATERIAL THE RUBBER WOOD TITANIUM ET CETERA
IF YOU GO FOR THAT TH THAT'S AT THE HIGH END 'CAUSE THAT'S POINT SIX WHEREAS DOWN AT UH JUST SPECIAL COLOURS UH IS POINT TWO
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO LOSE ONE POINT TWO SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'RE GOING FOR THE SAMPLE SENSORS SPEAKER
YOU'RE BASICALLY THEN HAVING TO GO FOR THE CHEAPER OPTIONS ON EVERYTHING ELSE
AND AND THE SIMPLE WAY TO DO IT WOULD BE TO HAVE A BATTERY TO HAVE YOUR UH SAMPLE SENSOR SPEAKER
AND THEN YOU'RE LOOKING TO UH TAKE OUT UH POINT TWO WHICH WOULD BE COME FROM THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS CATEGORY
UM INTERFACE TYPE UM WELL PLASTIC RATHER THAN RUBBER
THAT THAT THAT WOULD MAKE THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE
YOU COULD EITHER YOU COULD HAVE IT IF YOU HAVE A IN PLASTIC RATHER THAN RUBBER THEN THAT WOULD UH ENABLE YOU TO GET YOU COULD KEEP KINETIC THEN
YOU COULD KEEP YOUR SAMPLE SENSOR AND YOU'D BE LOOKING TO TAKE OUT POINT TWO
SO YOU COULD UH FIDDLE THAT DOWN YOUR SPECIAL FORM AT THE BOTTOM OR YOUR SPECIAL COLOUR AT THE BOTTOM
AND THAT WOULD ENABLE YOU TO TO DO IT
YEAH
YE
WELL OKAY BUT
IT'S RUBBER AS IT IS YES
WE GOT WE'VE WE'VE GOT THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN AND WE'VE GOT IT IN AT THE MOMENT AND IF AND BASICALLY WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE DOWN FROM THAT
BUT THE CURRENT ONE YOU'D SAY WOULD BE FANCY WOULD BE TOO
MM-HMM
I WOULD'VE SAID ABOUT A TWO AS WELL
OH
THE NEXT ON WELL I CAN JUST SING ABOUT
EASY TO USE
I WOULD'VE SAID YES
I WOULD GO FOR A ONE ON THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME
UM INCORPORATES ELEMENTS OF FASHION TO ATTRACT BUYER
WELL YEAH IT CERTAINLY HAS SOME
YEP
I DON'T KNOW
YEP
YEAH I WOULDA SAID TWO WOULD SEEM REASONABLE
THE PRODUCT IS A RECOGNISABLE REAL
R UH REACTION PRODUCT
OH
S
OKAY
SO WE'RE GOING FOR A
TWO THREE
SURE
RIGHT OKAY
TWO
RIGHT COME ON
THAT'S THAT DECIDED
RIGHT
SO
SO WE'RE NOW ON TO CHANGING IT TO GET IT TO FIT IN WITH THE BUDGET REQUIREMENTS AND THEN
ABOUT A TWO
TWO
YEP
TWO B TWO B TWO YEAH
YES
WELL YOU CAN LOSE ONE POINT TWO AND STILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS
OKAY WELL I PUT IT BACK ON
YES I WOULD'VE THOUGHT SO
OKAY SO WHAT WAS IT CONTROL UH F. EIGHT WASN'T IT
OH
OH
HOW KIND
RIGHT OKAY
SO YOU CAN SEE THERE THAT THE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP KINETIC RIGHT
YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE THERE OF GOING DOWN TO BATTERY WHICH WOULD SAVE YOU ONE
YOU'VE GOT
THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND AND SAMPLE SPEAKER WHICH IS YOUR BIG ITEM
THAT'S RIGHT
WHICH GETS YOU
YES
ALRIGHT
OKAY SO
SO WE'RE GOING FOR PLASTIC YES
YEP
WELL UH W UH THERE WAS DEBATE AS TO HOW YOU WOULD COUNT THEM
YOU GOT SPECIAL COLOUR
WELL ORIGINALLY I WAS ASSUMING WE HAD THE RED APPLE AND THEREFORE THAT WAS THE SPECIAL COLOUR
WELL WE'VE GOT SPECIAL FORM
NOW THAT WOULD BE ONE BUTTON AND THE QUESTION WAS WAS THAT ALL BUTTONS OR IS THAT JUST ONE BUTTON
'CAUSE OUR PLAN REALLY WAS TO HAVE ONE BUTTON ONLY WITH A SPECIAL SO SO NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SAME
THE OTHER THING WOULD THEN BE SPECIAL MATERIAL RUBBER WOOD TITANIUM
ALRIGHT
SO SPECIAL COLOUR YOU WANT THREE IN THERE
OKAY
THAT MAKES SENSE
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I THINK
SO SPECIAL COLOURS TWO
AND WE'VE GOT SPECIAL FORM IS THE ONE APPLE
THE REST ARE ALL STANDARD ALTHOUGH YOU COULD ARGUE THAT SHOULD MAYBE BE YOU WERE MAKING THESE BUTTONS DOWN THE BOTTOM
I WAS PRESUMING BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES OR WERE YOU
WAS THAT THE IDEA
UH-HUH
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT R WELL
RIGHT
YEP THAT MAKES SENSE
YEP
I WOULDA SAID SO
YEAH
SO YOU'D MAYBE PUT FASH FAN UH FASHION AT THREE RATHER THAN TWO
REAL REACTION PRODU I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
YEP I WOULD S
YOU MEAN OF
WELL YOU COULD ARGUE YOU MIGHT DO IT ONCE A YEAR YOU WOULD CHANGE BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE MAKING A RED APPLE
SO NEXT YEAR YOU COULD MAKE NEXT YEAR'S MODEL THE SAME BUT HAVE IT AS A A YEAH WHATE WHATEVER A LEMON
YEAH L A LEMON LEMON OR SOMETHING
AND THAT
AMOUNT
YEAH WE'VE THE MAIN THING WE'VE CHANGED REALLY IS THE CASING ISN'T IT
WE'VE
WELL EASE HAS CERTAINLY STAYED
YEAH
AND THE SPEECH FEATURE
HOW IT WOULD PLAY OUT YEAH
OH
WELL BUT YOU'VE GOT THE COMPANY LOGO ON THERE WHICH WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE A STICK ON BADGE
SO YOU'RE IN A SENSE YOU'RE COMPARING THE PRODUCT WITHOUT THE COMPANY LOGO
AND THEN Y BUT YOU'VE GOT THE SPACE FOR IT TO STICK IT ON
DON'T THINK SO
BUT BUT I BUT IN THE SENSE THAT AS YOU SAW WITH UM THE WINDOWS LOGO BADGE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
THERE'S VIRTUALLY N THE WAY THAT YOU FRAME YOU KNOW THE WINDOWS BADGE ON THERE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COLOUR IT IS
SO LONG AS OUR COMPANY'S LOGO IS FRAMED W IN THE SAME WAY AS THAT WITH A LIKE A BLACK OUTLINE
FACT THEY'VE GOT BLACK AND WHITE OR BLACK AND SILVER
SO BASICALLY EVEN IF YOU HAD A SILVER THE SAME COLOUR OF SILVER ON YOUR DISPLAY
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT EFFECTIVELY A DOUBLE EDGING ON THE UH ON THE LOGO IT MEANS THAT IT SPLITS OFF WHAT YOUR LOGO IS FROM THE FROM THE PRODUCT
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A SNEAKY WAY OF DOING IT
YOU COULD PUT IN ANOTHER WELL IN THIS ONE YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT THREE COLOURS OF BUTTONS
WELL WE DECIDED THAT THE BLUE ONES WERE THE UM THE STANDARD COLOUR
SO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT UH UM WE'RE ASSUMING THAT ALL THE BUTTONS ON THE SECOND PANEL THE HIDDEN AWAY PANEL WOULD ALL BE STANDARD
WHICH
M MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE CASE
WELL YEAH
BU BUT BUT UH WAS THE WAS THERE NOT A BUTTON THAT YOU WERE THINKING OF ON THE UM ON THE OTHER OPT YOU KNOW
ON THE SECOND PAGE AS IT WERE THAT UH YOU WERE THINKING OF MAYBE HAVING AS A DIFFERENT COLOUR
YEAH WELL
ALRIGHT
OKAY
SO WE JUST ADD THAT TO PROFITABILITY IN EFFECT
RIGHT SO WE'RE MEANT TO FINISH UP IN FIVE MINUTES
MM-HMM
SO WE'RE OKAY THIS WAY AROUND
UNTIL THE DESIGN TEAM COMES IN AND SAYS GET OFF
BUT YOU ARE THE DESIGN TEAM
SO WHAT BIT ARE WE ON TO
YEAH
I TH I TH OH
RIGHT OKAY
OH DRATS I'VE BOTCHED THAT HAVEN'T I
RIGHT OKAY UM
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE
RIGHT OKAY UM
MM
RIGHT OKAY UM RIGHT
SO WE GOT
SO WE'VE DONE THE
THE FINANCE BIT AND THE EXCEL PROJECT AND THE WE'VE DONE THE REDESIGN
SO WE'RE NOW ON TO PROJECT PROCESS
NOW SATISFACTION WITH FOR EXAMPLE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK MEANS ET CETERA WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS ET CETERA
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY NOW UH IN A SENSE
ON TO THE EVALUATION OF THE COURSE RATHER THAN THE EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT IS M MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT
SO WHAT DID YOU AND REMEMBERING THAT NOBODY'S JUST OVER THE CURTAIN
SO UM
SO
I SUPPOSE THE EASIEST WAY OF DOING IT IS TO PUT SOME NOTES DOWN WHICH I WILL DO
SO UH I THINK I HAVE TO FINISH THAT PAGE
RIGHT OKAY SO
PROJECT EVALUATION
SO UM
CREATIVITY
DID YOU FEEL YOU GOT A CHANCE TO EXPRESS YOURSELVES WELL ENOUGH
WELL UM
INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS
HOW DO YOU MEAN
IN YOU ON YOUR OWN
UM
MM THE ONLY THING YOU FIND IS IN A MANUFACTURING PROCESS
YOU WOULD NORMALLY YOU GO TO A MEETING YOU DECIDE RIGHT YOU DO THIS YOU DO THAT YOU DO THAT
THEN YOU GO AWAY
YOU FIND OUT INFORMATION
YOU THEN COME BACK
YOU THEN DISCUSS IT
YOU THEN GO AND CHANGE THINGS AROUND AND THEN GO BACK
SO
WHEREAS THIS TIME YOU'RE REALLY GETTING IT FROM A DATABASE SOURCE SO IT'S NOT UH WELL UH ANYWAY
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PUT DOWN
I'VE PUT SEEMED OKAY
CREATIVITY SEEMED OKAY
UM UM FLOW OF INFORMATION ON ON ANY GIVEN SUBJECT GIVEN SUBJECT UM SOMETIMES DISJOINTED
UM
HAVE COULD HAVE USED A DIFFERENT
EXAMPLE PEL TO INCREASE CREATE
CREATIVITY
YOU HAVE TO DO IT WITHIN A SET TIME FRAME IS THE OTHER THING SO
I TH I UH D
BUT THE OTHER THING IS THAT UH THEY'RE I'M GUESSING THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO USE THIS UM SOFTWARE TO TO DEMONSTRATE HOW YOU COULD UH DO A PROJECT
I MEAN M MY WIFE AT THE MOMENT FOR INSTANCE IS UH ACTING AS A COMPUTER UM FOR UM YOU NORMALLY
YOU GOT A PROBLEM SO YOU GO TO YOUR TUTOR AND FIND OUT INFORMATION TO SEE HOW TO GET IT FIXED
SO WHAT SHE'S DOING IS SHE'S HAVING TO SPEND A DAY AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL AT ONE END SO THAT ANY STUDENT THAT COMES ALONG CAN UH ASK WHATEVER QUESTION
AND THEN YOU OR THE IDEA IS THAT THE WHICHEVER UH PERSON'S AT THE OTHER END CAN POINT THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
SHOW THEM WHERE TO EITHER GIVE THEM DIRECTLY GIVE THEM HELP OR SECONDLY POINT THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
EITHER AT THE LIBRARY OR UH OR OR COME BACK OR GO AND SEE JOE BLOGGS OR WHATEVER
SO UH AND THAT WAS A PROJECT I SUSPECT SIMILAR TO THIS
BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DEBUG THE UH COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO ENABLE UM TO ENABLE IT TO WORK
AND OF COURSE YOU HAD THE MACHINE CRASHING AND VARIOUS THINGS GOING WRONG
SO
ALRIGHT SO WE'VE GOT UH
NEW IDEAS FOUND DID WE FIND ANY NO
ALRIGHT
LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK
DOES
YOU'VE GOT VOICE RECOGNITION COMPUTERS THAT'S NOT REMOTE CONTROLS
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO HOW DO YOU RECKON TEAMWORK WENT
TO UH GO UH REASONABLY WELL
OKAY
BIT BIT ARBITRARY
MM-HMM
SO WE'RE M WE'RE MEANT TO COMMENT ON LEADERSHIP AND THE MEANS E. G. WHITEBOARD DIGITAL PENS ET CETERA
AND AND NEW I NEW IDEAS FOUND WAS THE THE OTHER THING
NOW I'D MUCH RATHER BE IN MARKETING BUT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET THIS UH COMPUTER TO WORK AS WELL AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED
HOWEVER UM ALRIGHT UH MEANS SO WHITEBOARD UM SO REALLY IT'S UH EQUIPMENT
OH
RIGHT
NEW IDEAS FOUND SO ONE OR TWO
UM
AND UH
VOICE
UH WAS IT VOICE ACTIVATED UM
RECOGNITION
RIGHT SO UH ARE THE COSTS WITHIN BUDGET YES
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED YES
UH DON'T FORGET TO COMPLETE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY
THEN CELEBRATION
YEAH
UH SO WE DON'T RE SO REALLY
I TRIED TO SAVE THIS THE LAST TIME AT TWELVE POINT THREE AND IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE SAVED ANYWHERE
MIND YOU THE THE FIGURE LAST WAS WAS DIFFERENT BUT IT SHOULD BE POSS
WE ALSO HAVE A APPLE SLASH CHERRY DESIGN AT THE TOP
YEAH YEAH WE MIGHT GET A
FOR THE M.
THEY'RE THINKING
FOR THE FIRST TIME WELL IT WAS HARD TO GET THE H UM THE ACTUAL LABELLING ON THE INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS
HUM YOU SEPARATE OFF IN COLOUR THE VOLUME RELATED BUTTONS FROM THE CHANNEL RELATED BUTTONS
SO YOU'VE GOT THE VOLUME IN ORANGE ON DESIGN THERE AND THE THE CHANNEL IS IN BLUE
YEAH SIS
YES WE'LL HAVE THE SLIDE AWAY
BOTTOM
MM-HMM
YES YES
OKAY
MM-HMM
THIS THIS IS A YES THIS IS OUR PRESENTATION OF THE PROTOTYPE
MM-HMM
COULD WE GET THIS ON THE BOARD JUST SO WE CAN SEE OR DO YOU MEAN DO YOU HAVE THE FIGURES THERE
'KAY ALICE
SO SH
'KAY THIS SHOULD BE THEN
MM-HMM
HAVE A PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE
UM
UM
YEAH
AND THEN WE'D HAVE
SO THAT'S NINE POINT ONE THERE SO WE'VE GOT SOME
'KAY
JUST GIVE US A BIT OF
I SWITCHING AROUND THOSE TH UM ON THE ELECTRONICS WE GOT THE SAMPLE SENSOR
AT THE MOMENT WE'VE JUST GOT THE SIMPLE CHIP WHICH COSTS ONE
UM I GUESS THE SAMPLE SENS SAMPLE SPEAKER WOULD BE THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING WHICH PUTS UP TO FOUR
WE SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY OVER OUR BUDGET BUT IF WE GATHER SOMETHING ELSE DOWN TO SLIGHTLY LOWER STANDARD
AND MAYBE GO WITH THE ONE THE SPECIAL FORM BUTTONS THEN WE COULD HAVE THE SPEECH
SO UH MAYBE IF WE GOT RID OF LIKE THE MAYBE ONE OF THE SPECIAL COLOURS
KEPT THEM ALL THE SAME COLOUR THEN WE COULD HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION WITHOUT
YEAH YEAH
UM
OH POSSIBLY YEAH YEAH MAYBE
MAYBE UM WE'D BE GIVING UP ON THE KINETIC
UM
WE SHOULD YEAH THAT WOULD SAVE US ONE THOUGH WE'D STILL BE SLIGHTLY OV
YEAH YEAH
WELL SINCE IT'S THE THROUGH THE WHOLE TECHNOLOGY TYPE THING UM YOU WERE SAYING IN THE MARKET RESEARCH THAT PEOPLE LIKE KIND OF INTERESTING GADGETS IN THEM
UM WHETHER THEY WOULD FIGURE THE THE S UH SAMPLE SENOR AND THE SAMPLE SPEAKER VOICE RECOGNITION BE SORT OF A WORTHWHILE THING TO HAVE
AND THEN STILL HAVE THE BATTERIES OR WHATEVER THEY WOULD PREFER NOT UH YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
THE THE PROBLEM WAS THE BATTERY'S RUNNING OUT AND LOSING THE UM LOSING THE REMOTE
SO YOU GOTTA DECIDE WHICH OF THOSE IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY WELL WE HAVE A SINGLE CURVE WHICH WAS MAYBE LIKE THE FEEL OF THE PRODUCT'S QUITE GOOD
SO UH
UM THEN WE HAVE THE RUBBER KINDA SPONGY FEEL WHICH WAS IN AT THE TIME
UM SORRY THAT'D BE CONSIDERED FANCY
SO MAYBE MAYBE A TWO
YEAH
UM DECIDING BETWEEN THE KINETIC POWER OR UM THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND IF WE HAD EITHER OF THOSE FOR OUR BUDGET THEY BOTH SHOW A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
UM
BUT NOT THE KINETIC
LIKE THE POWER
NO WE C CA YEAH WE CAN'T AFFORD BOTH
NO MAY IS MAYBE ABOUT NEUTRAL PLUS IT IT IT'S GOT SOMETHING BUT IT HASN'T GOT
RIGHT
OKAY
'KAY
OKAY
UM
MM-HMM
SO IT SAYS IF WE MAKE A SLIGHTLY MORE FANCY THEN WE LOSE POINTS INNOVATION
AND IF WE MAKE IT MORE INNOVATIVE INNOVATIVE THEN WE LOSE POINTS ON IT BEING FANCY SO
YEAH YEAH
UM
IT DOES YEAH
YEAH M UM YEAH IT WAS JUST DOING IT QUITE WELL
UM I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOSE SOME OF THESE BUT THE MOMENT AS IT STANDS IT'S UM
UH THE SENSOR USING ALL OF ITS ALL OF ITS PRODUCTS ALL OF ITS BUTTONS AND IT'S GOT A FAIRLY BIG LABEL ON THE BOTTOM SAYING
WHERE IT COMES FROM
OKAY
ALSO IT'S KIND OF SPONGY RUBBERINESS IS MAYBE BIT MORE KINDA COMFORTABLE THAN KINDA SLEEK AND NEW AGE
UM IT DEPENDS WHICH WAY YOU LOOK AT IT
MAYBE A KIND OF THREE
UH D
YEAH SO IT'S
SO SHOULD WE GET SO ARE DEFINITE WAS IT THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN WAS THE DEFINITE PRICE RULE IF HAS
OKAY SO WE NEED TO
SO I GUESS THIS IS THIS THE LAST STAGE ONCE WE SORT OUT THE FINANCES PART OF IT
YEAH YEAH WE'LL MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS AND THEN SEE HOW ARE RATES ARE GOING
OH ACTUALLY WE JUST HAVE A PLASTIC CASE THEN WE LOSE TWO POINTS WHICH GETS US UM
IN RIGHT WITHIN THE BUDGET RANGE
SO THAT'S ELEVEN POINT SEVEN AND THEN WE COULD MAKE SURE WE DEFINITELY HAD ALL THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
POSSIBLY YEAH
UM
AND THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE ALL THE TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS
SO WE'D LOSE A LITTLE BIT ON THE MAYBE KIND OF
OH YEAH AND THAT WOULD NOW BE YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WITHIN THE BUDGET
UM
DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE DO WE JUST HAVE ONE SPECIAL UH SPECIAL FORMS DOWN HERE
UM
AND WE WE'VE WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER WE'VE GOT NOUGHT POINT EIGHT LEFT SO WE'VE GOT ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER
YEAH UM
BUT THE BUT BUT BUT THE
I THINK MAYBE THE SPECIAL COLOUR WE'VE GOT THREE NOW JUST BECAUSE THE VOLUME BUTTONS ARE DIFFERENT
I GUESS WE'D HAVE THE ONES WHICH ARE BLUE AT THE MOMENT WOULD WOULD JUST BE THE STANDARD COLOUR
YEAH WHICH I THINK WE SHOULD YEAH THEY'LL STILL BE FINE FOR THE FOR THE PRICE
OKAY UH THAT'S PROBABLY IT
NE UH
MAYBE THAT'LL BE A SECOND SUPPLEMENT
THEN THERE'S A SPE A SECOND SPECIAL FORM
UM
WELL YOU GOT YOU GOT TWELVE
SO I THINK THAT SHOULD STILL BE OKAY
YEAH THAT'S TWELVE POINT THREE SO WE'RE STILL
WITHIN BUDGET ON THAT
UM
SO DECIDE WE'VE LOST A LITTLE BIT ON THE FASHION AND LOST A BIT ON THE FANCY KINDA SIDE OF IT
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING WE'VE KEPT THE OTHER ATTRIBUTES TO THE
THAT'S WITHOUT
YEAH
AND SPECIALLY IT DEFINITELY COULD FITS THE THE REAL PRODUCT WHAT WAS THE WHAT'S THE COMPANY NAME
R YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I MEAN IT STILL SEEMS DEFINITELY FIT THAT P SO THAT'S LIKE IF THAT'S THE NEW AGE KIND OF UM INNO INNOVATIVE
C TYPE COMPANY THEN UM HAVING THE KINETIC FEATURE AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS P QUITE HIGH UP ON
UM
MM-HMM
YEAH SO IT'S A
WHATEVER FRUIT WAS IN FASHION NEXT YEAR
THAT YEAH THAT WAS UH THAT WAS JUST ABOUT ALL
I THINK WE'VE SAVED QUITE A BIT BECAUSE WE'VE JUST GOT THE PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE WHICH IS BY FAR THE CHEAPEST
UM
SO MAYBE IN A SENSE NOT HAVING THAT MAYBE WE'VE LOST SOME MAYBE LOST SOMETHING ON THE INNOVATION SIDE
I DUNNO
AND THAT IS LIKE THE MOST STANDARD TYPE OF BUTTON
YEAH
AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAS STAYED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SO
YEAH PLUS IF ANYTHING THAT IS SPECIAL FORMS MAKES IT SLIGHTLY EASIER TO
TO USE
UM WELL WE'VE STILL GOT THE KINETIC ENERGY
UM
YEAH THE SPEECH FEATURE
I THINK WE'VE CUT JUST ABOUT THE SAME
WE'VE MAYBE LOST
HASN'T IT IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW THE RUBBER THE RUBBER CASING WOULD REALLY AFFECT
UM
BUT I THINK MORE THE THE FEATURES OF THE ACTUAL CONTROL WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN MAYBE THAN THE THE ACTUAL AESTHETICS BUT
BUT EITHER WAY I THINK WE'VE MADE IT FAIRLY CLOSE TO WHAT
JUST THE THE COMPANY LOGO
SO MAYBE THERE'S LIKE A SET DESIGN WHICH WE GET PRINTED OFF
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
I'M STILL NOT QUITE SURE WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT
YEAH
UM
YEAH MAYBE WE'VE M
MAYBE FOR THE THE ONE THEY'RE GONNA SEE ALL THE TIME WE MAKE IT LOOK GOOD AND UM FIT THE KIND OF IDEA OF WHAT THEY WANT
AND THEN FOR THE MORE FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS
WE DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT AND JUST HAVE THAT AS LIKE A PLUS IT'S HIDDEN AWAY ANYWAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE IT AT THE START
YEAH
'KAY
UH
THAT'S GOOD
DEFINITELY LEMON SHAPED
YOU HAD TO HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS IF YOU HAD THE RUBBER CASE
SO I THINK WE CAN WE'RE OKAY
THEN WE SAY IT'S FINE SO IT'S ALL GOOD
JUST IN CASE WE NEED THAT POINT TWO FOR LAWSUITS AND SUCH LIKE
AND WE SEEM TO HAVE LEAST SOMETHING IN EACH CRITERIA
WE HAVEN'T COMPLETELY LEFT ANYTHING OUT SO
AS AN OVERALL PRODUCT WHICH HAS TO BE QUITE CHEAP WE'VE JUST ABOUT ACHIEVED
EVERYTHING
WE'VE GOT THE CLOSING
WE SHOULD JUST GO THROUGH THIS QUICKLY AND THEN
UM YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I SUPPOSE AND THEN BE GOING OUT AND FINDING MORE INFORMATION EACH TIME AND THEN DIFF THINGS WILL BE RELEVANT
IS THIS GO IT KINDA KIS FITS THE PURPOSE THAT IT WAS SOMETHING EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT AND THEN
SOMETHING WE CAN AT LEAST LOOK AT AND THINK HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ON
ONE OF THOSE THINGS
LIKE UH COMPANIES CAN HAVE LIKE A RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS BUT I GUESS THAT SOMETHING GOT SENT OUT AND HAVE LIKE A BRIEF TO KIND OF
YEAH
WELL SH WE LOOK AT THE LAST SLIDE SEE IF IT'S GOT ANYTHING ELSE
I THINK THERE'S ONE ONE MORE TO GO
IT WAS QUITE GOOD WITH THIS UM THE WHITE BOARD HAVING THAT AND THE DIGITAL PENS
LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MADE IT A LITTLE EASIER
VOICE RECOGNITION ESPECIALLY NOT COULD
YEAH
YEAH SO IT'S JUST LIKE THE SAME PRODUCTS BUT JUST PUT TOGETHER IN A DIFFERENT WAY
UM
YEAH I GUESS WE ALL HAD SEPARATE IDEAS AND THEN DISCUSSED THEM
SO IT'S NOT JUST FOR US IT'S FOR THE EXPERIMENT AS A WHOLE SO
SHOULD WE QUICKLY LOOK AT THE LAST SLIDE
SH
IS THAT EVERYTHING
WELL WE'VE MADE OUR PROTOTYPE ANYWAY
WE CAN HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT THAT
MM-HMM
Y NO IT'S A SLIGHTLY CURVED AROUND THE SIDES
UM IT'S ALMOST CURVED LIKE UP TO THE MAIN DISPLAY AS WELL
AND THE LITTLE LINE AT THE BOTTOM INDICATES THE BIT THE PANEL THAT YOU PULL DOWN
AND THE EXTRA FUNCTION BUTTONS ARE BELOW THAT PANEL ON THE LITTLE LINE
AND WE'VE GOT THE STICK ON THE BUTTON WITH THE COMPANY LOGO ON
YEAH IT'S A BIT MORE FUN ISN'T IT
AND IT'S KINDA NOT REALLY AT A KIND OF YOU THINK APPLE YOU THINK COMPUTERS LIKE APPLE MAC
YEAH AND CHERRIES ARE FUN SUMMERY
AH THAT'S THE MUTE
IT IT'D PROBABLY HAVE TO BE LABELLED MUTE
BUT UM WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING SMALL ENOUGH TO WRITE
YEAH
UH WE JUST CHOSE SIMPLE SHAPES FOR ALL THEM
UM THE IMPORTANT ONES ARE THE VOLUME ONES
SO WE MADE THEM A BIT BIGGER
THE MUTE COULD POSSIBLY BE A BIT SMALLER
MM-HMM
YEAH AND WE CHOSE A V. PLUS AND V. MINUS
WELL THE COLOURS WOULDN'T LIKE THAT'S THEY WOULDN'T BE TOO IMPORTANT BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY WHITE PLAY DOH
SO THAT'S WHERE THE COLOUR BUTTONS CAME FROM
UH THAT'S IT
MAYBE IF YOU JUST MINIMISE THAT ONE IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE LITTLE BOX
YEAH
S
UM
D WOULDN'T YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE SIMPLE CHIP THERE AS WELL
YOU KNOW HOW YOU TURN THAT ONE TO A ZERO WOULDN'T THE CHIP AND THE SAMPLE SPEAKER BE SEPARATE THINGS SO YOU NEED BOTH OF THEM
I THINK THE VOICE RECOGNITION
BUT I DO THINK UH THE V UH VOICE RECOGNITION THING WOULD BE MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE FACT THAT IT'S GOT NO BATTERY
YEAH I'D MAYBE GIVE IT A
A TWO
ONE'S TRUE
AND A FOUR IS NEUTRAL
YEAH 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT THE DOUBLE CURVE SO WE CAN'T LIKE SAY IT'S COMPLETELY TRUE
BUT IT'S PRETTY CLOSE
WE'VE GOT ALMOST EVERYTHING WE CAN
YEAH
YEAH I SUPPOSE THAT MIGHT BE IN THE TECHNICAL INNOVATION BIT
MAYBE A THREE
I WOULD GIVE IT MORE THAN A FOUR
HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE IF WE MADE THE CASE IN PLASTIC
BECAUSE WE DID SAY THAT WE DON'T WANNA FOLLOW THE FASHION TOO MUCH
IF THE BUTTONS ARE RUBBER THAT MIGHT BE SPONGY ENOUGH
AND THEN IT STAND THE TEST OF TIME BETTER
MM-HMM
WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S RUBBER AS IT IS ISN'T IT
YEAH
YEAH TWO OR THREE
I'D BE HAPPY WITH A TWO
YEAH
YEAH I WOULD SAY SO AS WELL
YEAH IT'S GOT THE CHERRY AND THE SPONGINESS
MAYBE TWO
YEAH THAT'S A BIT ROUGH AT THE MINUTE
UH WELL IT'S GOT THE SAME UM SPEECH FEATURE AS THE COFFEE MACHINE
YEAH TWO OR THREE
WELL THE LOGO WOULD BE MORE UM RECOGNISABLE ON THE ACTUAL THING
IT'S JUST THAT THE PEN WOULDN'T REALLY WRITE ON THAT PAPER
BUT UM
I THINK THE LOGO WOULD DEFINITELY BE RECOGNISABLE
AND IT DOES HAVE ATTRIBUTES THAT OTHER PRODUCTS DO
TWO
AYE
GO FOR IT
WHAT DOES WHAT DO ALL THEM NUMBERS MEAN THEN
DO WE ADD THEM UP AND RATE OR ANYTHING
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO RE RATE IT
AH IT'S ON
YEAH I THINK THAT'D BE FINE
BECAUSE THAT WAS JUST A TREND AND WE DO HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS ANYWAY
YEAH
YEAH I THINK WE SHOULD JUST IMAGINE WHITE BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH THE VOLUME ONES SHOULD STAND OUT A BIT
REAL REACTIONS
YEAH I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD MAKE IT ANY MORE
UM APART FROM MAYBE
DOING THE WHOLE THING IN THE KINDA LIGHT SHADE OF BLUE LIKE THE CASING
BUT THEN WHAT COLOUR WOULD YOU MAKE THE R. S
NO I JUST WE GOT THE LOGO OFF THE WEB BROWSER
MM-HMM
UM I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD REALLY NEED TO BE
I THINK IF THEY WERE JUST ALL SMALL ROUND BLUE BUTTONS IT'D BE FINE
NEEDS TO BE AN ENTER BUTTON BUT COULD JUST BE THE SAME AS WELL
MM-HMM
SHOULDN'T WE MAYBE LOSE A POINT ON FASHION GO TO A THREE
'CAUSE WE'VE LOST THE OVERALL SPONGY FEEL
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT THAT IT JUST HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL
ALRIGHT
DID WE DECIDE WHAT THAT WAS WHICH BUTTON IT WAS
ON THE VOLUME ONES
RIGHT
UM CAN I JUST CHECK IF THAT'S A CHERRY OR AN APPLE
DID WE DECIDE AGAINST THE APPLE BECAUSE OF APPLE MAC
AND DID WE MAKE IT A CHERRY OFFICIALLY
RIGHT
SO WERE WE AIMING FOR A CERTAIN TARGET ON THAT SCALE
RIGHT
SO DO WE HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DISCUSS
HUH
YEAH
I THINK IT MAYBE COULD HAVE BEEN A SLIGHTLY MORE CREATIVE PROJECT
I MEAN A REMOTE CONTROL ISN'T THE MOST UM
KIND OF FANCY THING THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE DESIGNING
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER EXAMPLE AT THE MINUTE
WELL IT'S A DIFFERENT APPLICATION OF IT
YEAH
WELL LEADERSHIP'S A BIT OF A FUNNY ONE ISN'T IT
BUT WE CAN'T REALLY ALL FAIRLY COMMENT ON LEADERSHIP BECAUSE YOU ARE THE PROJECT MANAGER
YOU WERE THE LEADER
SO OUR EXPERIENCE OF LEADERSHIP WASN'T REALLY
AS MUCH AS YOURS
YEAH VERY NICE
BUT I MEAN I D I DON'T I'M NOT SURE I SEE THE VALUE IN THESE
I MEAN THEY RECORD WHAT YOU'RE WRITING AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT
WHERE DO YOU GET THE RECORDING
DO YOU PLUG THE COMPUTER OR SOMETHING
RIGHT
I THINK YOU WATCH A VIDEO OF IT KIND OF
VOICE UM RECOGNITION THING
PRETTY MUCH
NO YOU'LL HA HAVE TO OPEN IT UP FROM ELSEWHERE
YEAH YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THAT WINDOW
'CAUSE THAT'S THE SAVE ONE ISN'T IT SO
AND THEN FIND IT
YOU PASS IT ROUND TO HAVE A LOOK
MM VERY NICE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO IT IS YEAH
CHERRY WOULD BE ALRIGHT ACTUALLY
YEAH
MM-HMM
COPYRIGHT YEAH
WHAT'S THIS THIS ONE
WHAT'S THAT ONE THERE
OH OKAY
RIGHT
UH-HUH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND THEM
HAVE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT
SO IF YOU HAD TO DO A PRESENTATION OR WILL YOU JUST WORK IT ON THE PROTOTYPE
THAT'S THE PR
OKAY
WE SHOULD PLUG IT IN
DO YOU WANNA PLU DO YOU WANNA PLUG IT IN INTO THE THE BACK OF THAT ONE
WE COULD DO IT AS WE D GO ALONG THE PRODUCTION COSTS LOOKING AT THE PROTOTYPE
WELL DO WE'LL DO IT ON THE PROTOTYPE SO DO TWO SEE HOW MUCH IT IS
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
I THINK YOU JUST DO ONE DON'T YOU FOR THE
I THINK I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S JUST A ONE
ELSE
I THI I THINK I THINK THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENT I IS JUST A SUPPLEMENT FOR ALL THE BUTTONS MADE IN A DIFFERENT MATERIAL RATHER THAN PER BUTTON
I DON'T KNOW THOUGH
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YOU'VE JUST GONE OFF THE WINDOW INTO ANOTHER ONE
IT'S ON THE BOTTOM ROW
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WE HAVE TO HAVE IT
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
SHALL WE SHALL WE EVALUATE THE PROTOTYPE AS WE'VE GOT IT NOW FIRST AND THEN SORT OF MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AFTER
OKAY
RIGHT UM I HAVE A LITTLE THING
SO WE'VE ALL GOT A NOTE OF IT'S THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN ISN'T IT WITH EVERYTHING WE WANT ON
YEAH I JUST HAD A PRESENTATION TO
DO
MM-HMM
MM
RIGHT OKAY UM
THIS IS ABOUT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA THAT WE USE FOR THE THE PROTOTYPE WE'VE GOT HERE
AND SO THE METHOD IS THAT THE DESIGN TEAM MAKES A PROTOTYPE AND WE EVALUATE THE PROTOTYPE AGAINST SOME CRITERIA THAT WE'VE FORMULATED
AND THOSE ONES ARE GONNA BE IN RESPONSE TO SORT OF MARKET RESEARCH AND ALSO FINANCE I GUESS
AND DO THAT ON A SCALE FROM SAY TRUE BEING ONE AND FALSE BEING SEVEN SO IF IT'S NEITHER TRUE NOR FALSE THEN THAT'S FOUR
SO I GOT A SET OF CRITERIA JUST BASED ON THE MARKETING THAT WE NEED TO ADD IN A FINANCIAL ONE AS WELL AT THE END
UM SO
WE HAVE TO SAY WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR FALSE THAT THE PRODUCT LOOKS AND FEELS FANCY
UM
THE WHETHER THE PRODUCT DEMONSTRATES TECHNICAL INNOVATION
WHETHER IT'S EASY TO USE
WHETHER IT'S INCORPORATING SORT OF THE FASHION ELEMENT TO ATTRACT THE BUYER
AND WHETHER IT'S A SORT OF RECOGNISABLE REAL REACTION PRODUCT
AND I HAVE TO GO UP ONTO THE WHITEBOARD AND DO THIS APPARENTLY SO I'LL GO OVER HERE
RIGHT
SO THE FIRST ONE IS UM DOES THE PRODUCT LOOK AND FEEL FANCY
SO IF WE DO A SORT OF A ONE
SO
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OF BUT I THINK WHAT IS ONE FALSE OR IS T ONE TRUE
I FORGOT
ONE'S TRUE AND OKAY
SEVEN'S FAL FOUR IS NEUTRAL OKAY
SO
RIGHT
OKAY
RIGHT
I GONNA PUT UNDERNEATH SO I'VE GOT SOME MORE SPACE
SO FALSE IS SEVEN TRUE IS ONE AND
SO UH SAY ABOUT A TWO FOR FANCY YOU THINK
OKAY
OKAY WELL D YOU DO AN AVERAGE AT THE END I DON'T KNOW
UM
UH-HUH
THIS THIS IS JUST THIS IS JUST FOR LIKE THE LOOK
DOES IT SORT OF LOOK FANCY RATHER THAN FUNCTIONAL
SO
YEAH SO THAT SO SH SHOULD WE GO FOR A A TWO ON THAT
'KAY
AND I MEAN HOW MUCH DOES THE PRODUCT DEMONSTRATE TECHNICAL INNOVATION DO YOU RECKON
D YEAH
OKAY
SO WHAT ABOUT THE PR THE PROTOTYPE AS IT IS WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION ON IT HAVEN'T WE
BUT NOT THE KINETIC
ALRIGHT SO
SO IT DOESN'T IT'S PRETTY THE PROTOTYPE AS IT IS ISN'T SORT OF UM FULFILLING THE
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT OKAY
MM-HMM
S
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK MY EMAIL
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID IN THE EMAIL FOR UM
THE PRODUCT
OKAY
BUT I
OKAY
YEAH
I JUST READ THE EMAIL AGAIN AND IT SORT OF SAYS IT'S EVALUATE THE DESIGN SORT OF AS IT IS I THINK
SO I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT FINANCE AFTER WE'VE SORT OF EVALUATED THAT DESIGN
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'RE DOING IT IN THE WRONG ORDER OR SOMETHING OR
SO I MEAN DOES THIS NEED TO GO UP A BIT OR SOMETHING 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT BOTH THE
BOTH THE UM
THE SPEECH
YEAH
YEAH
UM FOR FOR INNOVATION SO WE'VE GOT THE SPEECH THE SPEECH THING AND
DO YOU RECKON A TWO
OKAY
TWO
AND THE NEXT ONE IS I'LL HAVE TO GET IT BACK UP NOW
OKAY
UM
SAY ABOUT A THREE MAYBE
IT'S A TWO
YEAH THIS IS
THIS
YEAH
SO THIS IS ABOUT SORT OF THE CORPORATE IMAGE OF LIKE NEW SORT OF SLEEK TECHNOLOGY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
AS WELL AS HAVING THE LOGO ON AND ALL THAT
SO SORT OF
IS IT SORT OF A RECOGNISABLE PRODUCT
DOES IT FIT IN WITH OUR OTHER OTHER PRODUCTS WHICH UH ARE SORT OF COFFEE MAKERS AND SPACECRAFT
WHAT DO Y
YEAH
UH-HUH
SO
TWO OR THREE
YEAH
TWO OR THREE
HOW
TWO
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH WE S YEAH I THINK WE SORT OF ADD THEM UP SO SORT OF AT AN AVERAGE IS GONNA BE I'M JUST GONNA DO THIS IN MY HEAD
ONE POINT EIGHT ISN'T IT OR SOMETHING
I THINK ANYWAY
SO YEAH PRETTY CLOSE TO A TWO
SO
SO IT'S I MEAN IT'S PRETTY GOOD AT THE MOMENT BUT IT'S GONNA GET WORSE ISN'T IT
BUT WE'VE GOTTA TRY AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET TOO BAD
YEAH
DO YOU WANNA PLUG IT INTO YOURS SO WE CAN GET UP THE
THE FINANCES
I'M NOT SURE
YEAH
IT'S COME ON ALREADY
MM
YEAH
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT COLOURS YEAH
YEAH
I WAS I WAS THINKING THAT BECAUSE MAYBE MAYBE THE SORT OF RUBBER CASE IS A BIT LESS IN SORT OF THE CORPORATE IDENTITY THAN THE SORT OF YOU KNOW SLEEKER PLASTIC CASE
LOSE A LITTLE BIT ON THE FASHION YEAH BUT
AND THEN
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THIN I THINK YOU YOU YOU JUST NEED TWO FOR THE SPECIAL COLOUR 'CAUSE IT'S JUST TWO SUPPLEMENTS YOU KNOW
ONE ORIGINAL COLOUR AND THEN SORT OF TWO SUPPLEMENTS I THINK MAYBE
OKAY
SO WE ONLY NE WE ONLY NEED TWO FOR THAT
'CAUSE I MEAN THESE THESE ARE MOULDED
THE ONE COLOUR'S GONNA BE MOULDED OUT OF A PIECE OF PLAS UH OF RUBBER ISN'T IT
RIGHT
YEAH THAT
YEAH
OKAY SO THA
SO SHALL WE DO A WELL UM
YEAH
YEAH SO
UH
SO IT'S W IF WE'VE IF WE'VE PUT IN FOR ANOTHER SPECIAL FORM ON A BUTTON THEN MAYBE THEY COULD BE A DIFFERENT SHAPE
LIKE WE GOT A CHERRY ONE
MAYBE OTHER ONES COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE SHAPED
I DON'T KNOW
THAT WOULD BE POSS SEEING AS SEEING AS IT'S CHEAPER TO MAKE THEM A DIFFERENT
SEEING AS WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW WE'VE MADE IT A A SPECIAL FORM
SO AND THAT WOULD SORT OF MAYBE KEEP US CLOSE ON THE SORT OF THE FASHION TYPE ONE
AND IT WOULD SORT OF YOU KNOW KEEP IT QUITE FANCY AS WELL I DON'T KNOW
WELL YOU COULD
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN THE VOLUME BUTTONS COULD BE LEMONS OR SOMETHING MAYBE
OKAY
SO WE'VE WHAT HAVE WE WHAT HAVE WE RID OF
WE GOT RID OF
THE PLASTIC
IS IT THE RUBBER
YEAH
YEAH
BUT UH
SO I MEAN WE'VE GOT WE GOT RID OF THE RUBBER CASE BUT
WE'VE NOW S WE NOW SORT OF GOT AN EXTRA FORM AND AN EXTRA COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS
SO MAYBE IN TERMS OF SORT OF FANCINESS AND FASHIONABILITY WE'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MAYBE
SO I MEAN WE COULD MAYBE PUT TWO AGAIN ON THEM
YEAH
YEAH
AND WHAT ABOUT THE SORT OF INNOVATION
DO YOU THINK
OKAY
AND THEN THE CORPORATE IDENTITY
YEAH
WHETHER WHETHER THAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE SORT OF
PART OF THE CORPORATE IDENTITY I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN IT'S MAYBE NOT
I MEAN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY WELL I MEAN
WE COU
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
HEY WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE COMPANY COLOUR
DID YOU GET TOLD WHAT THE COMPANY COLOUR IS OR
OH RIGHT
HMM
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
UH-HUH
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT SORT OF WE'VE GOT POINT TWO TO PLAY WITH IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO
ANOTHER COLOUR
OR WOULD THAT BE T
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
SHALL WE SAVE THE POINT TWO FOR PROFITABILITY THEN
HMM
YEAH
I MEAN IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT I MEAN YOU WANNA PICK UP THE CONTROLLER AND JUST HIT A BUTTON QUICKLY TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR VOLUME
SO IF IT'S DEAD OBVIOUS THEN THAT'S FINE
BUT IF YOU'RE OPENING THE PANEL AND YOU'RE LOOKING AND YOU'RE TUNING THEN YOU'RE PAYING A BIT MORE ATTENTION
SO IT MAY BE SORT OF DIFFERENT COLOUR BUTTONS ISN'T SO IMPORTANT
'CAUSE YOU YEAH
SO
YEAH I MEAN SO WE'VE DROPPED THE COST BUT
SAME SORT OF FUNCTION
THE CRITERIA
IT'S ALRIGHT
JUST MADE A LOAD OF MONEY
WELL BUT I THINK WE SAID THAT W
BECAUSE YOU GOT RID OF THE RUBBER WE PUT AN EXTRA AN EXTRA SORT OF FRUIT UM SHAPE ON ONE OF THE BUTTONS
LE LEMON SH
I THINK WELL WE COULD HAVE LEMON SHAPED ONES WITH THE VOLUME ONES OR SOMETHING
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
DID DID YOU HAVE TO HAVE A RUBBER CASE THOUGH FOR RUBBER BUTTONS
OR WAS IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
RIGHT OKAY
YEAH
SO THAT SO WE'VE SAVED
SAVED TWO EUROS ON THAT
MM-HMM
WELL WE'RE AIMING FOR UM ONE FOR ALL OF THEM
M BUT IT REALLY HAS TO FIT INTO THE BUDGET SO
I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO ADJUST THINGS TO
GET IT I IN THE
WHICH IS FAIR ENOUGH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK
MOST
YEAH
YEP
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA
UH-HUH
FINISH YOUR MEETING NOW
YEAH
OKAY
OH
I THOUGHT SOME OF THE DIVISIONS THOUGH BETWEEN SORT OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WERE A BIT ARBITRARY
YEAH
WELL WE WERE FINDING OUT VARIOUS THINGS IN
IN BE IN BETWEEN THE MEETINGS AND THEY DIDN'T THE ONE MEETING DIDN'T ALWAYS FOLLOW ON FOR THE OTHER ONE
YOU KNOW SORT OF WE HAD THINGS THROWN IN AT THE SECOND MEETING WHERE
YOU KNOW YOU'D LOOKED AT THE REMOTE CONTROLS AND SEEN THE CURVINESS
BUT IN THE FIRST ONE YOU'D ALSO LOOKED AT SOME REMOTE CONTROLS AND LOOKED AT THE BUTTONS
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT WOULD BE IN SEPARATE MEETINGS THAT YOU'D DO THAT
YOU KNOW YOU'D SORT OF YOU'D PROBABLY PRESENT IT AT ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THE THING ITSELF
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT THINK LIKE IT WAS A BIT RESTRICTIVE JUST TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO DESIGN A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL IN A WAY
I MEAN IT DEPENDS WHAT SORT OF BUSINESS YOU'RE IN I GUESS
I MEAN THIS ONE SEEMS
FROM THE WEBSITE IT LOOKS IT'S QUITE INNOVATIVE BUT WE'RE COMING UP WITH SOME BUCKET SHOP PRODUCT AREN'T WE THAT'S YOU KNOW FIFTEEN QUID
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR PRODUCTS ON THEIR WEBSITE HERE REAL REACTION I MEAN IT'S ALL PRETTY HIGH TECH AND CUTTING EDGE
AND
YEAH
YEAH
WE DID FIND A NEW IDEA I MEAN SORT OF A KINETIC REMOTE CONTROL
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THEM BEFORE
BATTERIES I THINK
SO
MM YEAH
YEAH
MM
THAT WENT OKAY YEAH
MM-HMM YEAH
I DON'T THINK SORT OF THE BUDGET UM ALLOWED US TO DO ANYTHING
WELL I MEAN I DON'T THINK IT I JUST DON'T THINK IT FITTED IN WITH THE REST OF THEIR PRODUCTS
I MEAN THEY'VE GOT ALL THESE SORT OF YOU KNOW
HIGH DEFINITION D. V. D. AND
PORTABLE SEVEN INCH D UM LIGHTWEIGHT COMPUTER SCREENS AND UH I'M THINKING DO YOU KNOW ONE CHEAP REMOTE CONTROL DOESN'T REALLY FIT IN
SURELY THEY THEY SHOULD PRODU
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT WORKED
COMPUT COMPUTERS COULD BE A BIT DIFFICULT AT TIMES BUT
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE THERE'S A LITTLE UM CHI
THERE'S A LITTLE THERE'S A LITTLE CHIP I THINK YOU MUST PLUG IT INTO SOMETHING AND IT PRODUCES A
I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER IT JUST PRODUCES A BIG IMAGE OF SORT OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE WRITTEN OR SOMETHING AND PAGE AFTER PAGE
YEAH
KINETIC POWERED REMOTE CONTROL
UM
WHAT WAS THE OTHER ONE
VO YEAH
VOICE RECOGNITION YEAH
S
ALMOST
TO FILL IN THESE FILL IN THESE QUESTIONNAIRES
OH NO
HMM
I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TWO QUESTIONNAIRES AND A REPORT ON THE LAST MEETING
ALRIGHT THAT DID NOTHING

SORRY GUYS
I DID
TWICE
THIS'LL JUST TAKE A MOMENT

IS ONE THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING TODAY UM UM AS WELL AS PLANNING THE PROJECT HOW WE'RE GOING TO
UH CREATE THIS PRODUCT AND UM DISCUSS
UM OUR AIMS AND OBJECTS OF THIS UH WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEXT SUBJECT IS UM
UM AS A TEAM WE'RE GOING TO BE DESIGNING AND CREATING A NEW KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL
UM WE WANT THIS TO BE A MARKETABLE PRODUCT THAT CAN BE TRENDY UM A COMPLETELY NEW STYLE SO THAT
UM CAN REALLY APPEAL TO A TO A GENERATION THAT DOESN'T WANT A SIMPLE PLAIN KIND OF UH CHANNEL CHANGER
AND UM IT NEEDS TO BE USER FRIENDLY FOR UM MAYBE FOR AN EXAMPLE
FOR PEOPLE THAT UM CAN'T SEE THE NUMBERS AS WELL OR UM PERHAPS AN ERGONOMIC DESIGN
YES IT'S A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
RIGHT
I BELIEVE I SHOULD BE TAKING MINUTES ON THIS RIGHT NOW
SO ALRIGHT
UM YEAH
UM THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT THIS IS UM WE'LL HAVE A TIME WHERE WE CAN UM
COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS ALONE AND AND WORK ON THE PROJECT AND THEN UM AFTER WE'VE BRAINSTORMED AND AND THOUGHT ABOUT
WE CAN COME TOGETHER IN A MEETING AND AND DISCUSS WHAT WHAT UM WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONAL DESIGN WE WANT TO USE
SAME WITH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAILED DESIGN
SO UM
MAKING SURE THAT IT IT'S USABLE THAT AS A UM
AND THAT IT'S IT'S FEASIBLE TO CREATE AND UH
TO COME UP WITH A CONCEPT OF IT WANT WHAT WE WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE
UM TOOL TRAINING
IS IS EVERYONE UM
OKAY
GREAT
GREAT
UM
ONE THING THAT UH WE'RE GOING TO DO IS BECOME MORE ACQUAINTED WITH THE THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO FOR OUR PROJECT
UM ONE OF THEM IS OUR WHITEBOARD
AND UM AS A SORT OF TEAM BUILDING MOMENT UM I I'D LIKE US TO
UM TRY OUT THE WHITEBOARD BY EXPRESSING OUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND THE CHARAC CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT ANIMAL
UM WHY THAT WHY THAT SHOULD BE YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL
SO UM I I'M ASSUMING THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT NOW
'KAY
WITH OUR MICROPHONES STILL ATTACHED TO OUR BODIES
OKAY
'KAY WHAT'S MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
DO COME UP
THIS IS A TEAM BUILDING TIME WHERE UM OKAY COOL UM
MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL WHICH CHANGES ALL THE TIME OKAY
RIGHT NOW IT IS AN ELK

DO YOU HAVE
'KAY UM
THANKS
THIS IS MY
OKAY
THAT'S A SKETCHING OF MY MY ELK AND IT IT IS MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE IT IS A LARGE BEAUTIFUL MAJESTIC CREATURE
THAT UM THAT UM IN A WAY IT LOOKS KIND OF AWKWARD
BECAUSE IT'S ON SPINDLY LEGS AND IT UH BUT IT CAN REALLY OVERCOME HARSH TERRAIN
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S GORGEOUS IT'S ALSO VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT HAS UM STRONG ANTLERS AND UH
IT CAN REALLY COMBAT ITS ENEMIES EVEN LIKE IT IT'S A IT'S AN HERBIVORE BUT UH IT CAN REALLY DEFEND ITSELF
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT I'M GONNA TAKE MINUTES WHILE UM YOU GUYS EXPRESS YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMALS
OH
GREAT
I FORGET HER NAME
IT LOOKS KINDA LIKE A PERSON

GREAT
DO YOU HEAR THE ERASER BUZZING WHILE YOU DO THAT
YEA

SO NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO USE THE WHITEBOARD UM THE NEXT UM
THING WE NEED TO ADDRESS IS OUR FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT TO MEET OUR OUR BUDGET
UM OR NOT MEET OUR BUDGET BUT MORE UM LIKE WHAT KIND OF UH SELLING RANGE WE'LL BE LOOKING AT
UM WANNA MAKE THIS UM SELLING PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE EUROS
AND SO WE HAVE TO UM COME UP WITH A WAY TO TO CREATE A A UH REMOTE CONTROL WHERE UM
WE CAN LIKE THE PRICE TO CREATE IT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS
UM WE'D LIKE TO UM
TO UH MAKE FIFTY MILLION EURO
I'M ASSUMING THAT'S WHAT THE M. MEANS
UM AND MAKE IT FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
UM ONE THING WE'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT INTERNATIONALLY IS IN THE DESIGN OF UM LIKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF UH V. C. R. S
THINGS LIKE THAT DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTRY YOU ARE
ANOTHER THING FOR THE DESIGN TEAM TO THINK ABOUT
UM WE WANT IT TO COST UH ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM OF TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS
I'M BAD AT MATH
'KAY
UM SO NOW THAT UM THAT IS UNDERWAY UM
IT IS DISCUSSION TIME
SO THIS IS TIME FOR US TO BRING OUR INITIAL IDEAS ANY UM
SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE SO FAR A UM YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS
AND UM UM AREAS YOU SEE THAT UH COULD BE IMPROVED IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THEM
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY INITIAL THOUGHTS
MM-HMM
SO WHAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD UH DO TO REMEDY THAT
YEAH
IT'S A GREAT IDEA
IT'S A GREAT IDEA
ALRIGHT
ANYTHING ABOUT UM THE LOOK OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE IDEAS ABOUT
MAYBE IT COULD BE INSTEAD OF LIKE A STANDARD RECTANGULAR SHAPE IT COULD BE UM SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING LIKE
ANY IDEAS WILL DO THAT YOU HAVE AT THIS POINT
CAN HOLD IT
YEAH
WELL IF IT'S A TRENDY ORIGINAL UM ASPECT WE'RE GOING FOR
I MEAN YOU'RE THE DESIGNERS YOU C YOU CAN UM DECIDE WHAT KIND OF UM DIRECTION YOU WANNA GO IN
BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE IN THE FIRST MEETING IT CAN BE ANY IDEAS THAT WE JUST THROW OUT THERE
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND THE KEY ISSUE HERE IS IS BEING TRENDY AND ORIGINAL
UM THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE OUTRAGEOUS
RIGHT
OKAY WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT
SO JUST TO COVER WE HAVE ONE MORE THING
UM LIKE YOU CAN GO OVER YOUR IDEAS OF COURSE IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL TIMES
UM OUR NEXT MEETING WILL BE IN HALF AN HOUR
SO YOU HAVE HALF AN HOUR TO UH THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO PRESENT
OR NOT PRESENT BUT BRING TO THE MEETING
UM I. D. WHATEVER THAT STANDS FOR
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
I HAVE TO REMEMBER THESE THINGS
UM
YOU'LL BE BEGINNING YOUR YOUR WORKING DESIGN
UM U. I. D. THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN WILL WILL BE WORKED ON THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES
UM MAYBE HOW THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED AND UM WE NEED THE USER REQUIREMENTS FROM THE MANAG MARKETING EXPERT
UM YOU WILL GET SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS UM OF WHAT TO DO IN THE NEXT HALF AN HOUR
AND I'LL SEE YOU IN HALF AN HOUR OKAY
'KAY
OKAY OKAY
OKAY
HELLO
OKAY
MY NAME'S POPPY
I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER FOR THIS PROJECT
UM I'M GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN PHASE
ALSO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THE DETAILED DESIGN FOR THE FINAL PRODUCT
OKAY
OKAY
SO THIS IS A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
GOT THOSE NOTES
OKAY
OKAY
OH TO GO FIRST
OH ARE WE ALL DOING IT INDIVIDUALLY
OKAY LET'S STAND UP AND SUPPORT YOU
OKAY
DO YOU HAVE ELK WHERE YOU COME FROM
YOU DO

I AM A BIG ANIMAL LOVER
I LIKE ALL SORTS OF ANIMALS BUT FOR THE MOMENT I'M GONNA DRAW A CAT IN MEMORY OF MY POOR CAT THAT DIED RECENTLY
IT'S GONNA BE A BIT OF A STRANGE DRAWING BUT NEVER MIND
NOT AS ARTISTIC AS HEATHER'S DRAWING
BIT MORE CARTOON STYLE
BUT I LIKE CATS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO INDEPENDENT AND THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO BE DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO BE DOING
UM BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE COMPLETELY NOT SOCIABLE 'CAUSE THEY ENJOY INTERACTING WITH HUMANS AS WELL
AND THEY SEEM TO ENJOY THE GOOD THINGS LIKE SUNSHINE AND UM
RUNNING AROUND OUTSIDE AS WELL AS BEING INSIDE AND ENJOYING THEIR FOOD AND GENERALLY JUST THEY JUST SEEMED SO COOL AND THEY JUST KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING
UH I RECKON THEY'RE SORT OF THEY GOT IT SORTED
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
BASICALLY THAT'S WHY I LIKE CATS

OOH
WELL THERE ARE LOADS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOGS SO I'M SURE IT'LL REPRESENT ONE KIND OF DOG
WE CAN PRETEND
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
VERY NICE
OKAY
OKAY
I ALWAYS FIND THAT IN OUR HOUSE THE REMOTE CONTROL ALWAYS GOES MISSING
IT'S ALWAYS WHERE IS THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD HAVE SOME KIND OF
TRACKING DEVICE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL OR SOME SIGNAL THAT YOU COULD FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS
I DUNNO SOME KIND OF ALARM
YOU CAN PRESS A BUTTON ON YOUR WALL SIGNAL 'CAUSE IT ALWAYS GETS LOST
YEAH
YEAH THAT YOU DON'T USE HALF OF THEM
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S YEAH IT IS
YEAH
YEAH
MM
A NOVELTY
ARE WE GOING INTO KIND OF NOVELTY FACTORS HERE
LIKE I'VE SEEN PHONES LIKE A OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
I SUPPOSE IF WE'RE HE HEADING TO HAVE IT LIKE MAKE A HUGE PROFIT OUT OF THIS IT NEEDS TO BE QUITE A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED THING
LIKE A NOVELTY THING MIGHT ONLY SELL A FEW THINGS RATHER THAN LIKE
A GENERAL KIND OF MORE ACCEPTABLE BUT WE DON'T WANNA GO TOWARDS BORING 'CAUSE THAT WOULDN'T SELL EITHER
SO HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
THAT'S ME
MM-HMM
OKAY
THANK YOU
MY NAME'S TARA AND I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
I WILL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN PHASE THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE AND THE DETAILED DESIGN PHASE OF THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
GOSH
YEAH
AN ELK
A VICIOUS
WE HAVE SHEEP
THAT IS REALLY GOOD
I'M QUITE
VERY GOOD
OKAY
I THINK MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL WOULD BE A DOG BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW TO DRAW ONE
I I'VE NEVER DRAWN A DOG I DON'T THINK
I'M TEMPTED TO DRAW A SNAIL 'CAUSE I DRAW THEM SOMETIMES AND THEY'RE REALLY EASY TO DRAW
UM
RIGHT IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY FUNNY DOG 'CAUSE I'M NOT SURE HOW TO DRAW A DOG
IT'S A CARTOON DOG I THINK

YOUS KNOW WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
IT'S A DOG
UM I LIKE DOGS BECAUSE UM THEY'RE SO GOOD TO HUMANS
LIKE THEY CAN BE TRAINED TO BE POLICE DOGS AND SEEING EYE DOGS AND THEY'RE JUST SUCH FRIENDLY ANIMALS
AND LIKE THEY'RE MORE OF A COMPANION THAN CATS
I'VE NOTHING AGAINST CATS
CATS DON'T REALLY LIKE ME SO I CAN'T LIKE THEM
BUT THEY'RE JUST SO FRIENDLY AND WARM AND NICE ANIMALS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT
YEAH
DO YOUS NOT FIND THAT UM
LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF UM BUTTONS ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HALF OF THEM DO
YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU MAY HAVE TO DO THE FUNCTION F. EIGHT THING
OH OKAY
HI I'M GENEVIEVE
I'M THE MARKETING EXPERT
I'M AN EXPERT AT MARKETING
UM I'LL BE TELLING YOU GUYS ABOUT THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS FOR OUR NEW PRODUCT
UM I'LL BE DOING SOME TREND WATCHING IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND PRODUCT EVALUATION FOR THE DESIGN PHASE
YEAH
THANK YOU
WE HAVE MOOSE TOO
UH OH WE HAVE A GOOD ARTIST
OH VERY SHAPELY
OH
TARA
OR TARA
THAT'S PINOCCHIO
ALRIGHTY
I FEEL LIKE A ROBOT
OKAY
UM WELL I GUESS I HAD THE MOST TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT
I'M GOING TO DRAW A BUTTERFLY BECAUSE I SAW A BUTTERFLY YESTERDAY THAT SEEMED TO BE LIKE THE SYMBOL OF SPRING ARRIVING
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY THE PRETTIEST BUTTERFLY I'VE EVER SEEN OUT IN THE WILD AND I THOUGH THAT WAS PRETTY COOL IN SCOTLAND
IT WAS LIKE WELL IT WAS A LITTLE POINTIER THAN THAT
AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A DEAD LEAF
AND THEN IT LANDED ON THE WALL NEXT TO ME
BUT THIS PART WAS ALL BROWN AND THEN IT HAS THESE BIG BLUE DOTS LIKE THIS
AND THEN IT KINDA THERE WAS A GREEN I THINK IT WAS A GREEN RING AND THERE WAS LIKE RED GOING OUT LIKE THIS
YEAH IT KINDA WAS ACTUALLY 'CAUSE IT WAS THIS PART OF THE BODY WAS REALLY DULL
AND THEN IT WAS THE MOST COLOURFUL EXOTIC BUTTERFLY EVER AND I'M LIKE WOW THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF SCOTLAND IN LIKE MARCH
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY COOL
AND IT LANDED BY A WALL AND LET ME LOOK AT IT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES
I WISH I'D HAD MY CAMERA
SO THAT'S GONNA BE MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE SNOW IT SEEMED TO SAY THAT LIKE SPRING IS FINALLY HERE
YEAH
THERE YOU GO
UH WHAT DO WE OH
YES I DO
OKAY SO WE'LL HAVE A HUNDRED PERCENT PROFIT THEN
TWELVE FIFTY
OKAY
I FIND THAT IN THE DARK IT'S OFTEN HARD TO KNOW WHAT BUTTON YOU'RE PUSHING
UM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THERE'S SOME REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE THERE'S KIND OF A HIDDEN PANEL SO ALL THOSE BUTTONS THAT YOU DON'T REALLY USE UNLESS YOU'RE PROGRAMMING OR SOMETHING
THAT'S USEFUL
SO YOU JUST HAVE LIKE THE NUMBER BUTTONS POWER BUTTON T. V. VIDEO BUTTON
COULD BE SHAPED LIKE A CONCH YOU KNOW
BE LIKE A SHELL SHAPED REMOTE
INTERFACE
OH INDUSTRIAL
MARKETING EXPERT
AM I STARTING NOW
ANYTIME
OH SORRY
'KAY UM
ALRIGHT WELCOME BACK FRO TO THE SECOND MEETING
AND UM I HOPE YOU HAD A PRODUCTIVE LAST THIRTY MINUTES
UM AND UM I'LL BE TAKING MINUTES ON THIS ONE AND UM BEING HOOKED UP TO THE POWERPOINT FOR THIS MEETING ISN'T VERY NECESSARY FOR UH MYSELF
BECAUSE IT'LL BE MORE ABOUT UH WHAT YOU GUYS ARE BRINGING TO THE MEETING TODAY
UM SO THE FIRST PRESENTATION WE'LL BE LOOKING AT IS POPPY'S PRESENTATION
AND UM
SO SORRY
SO UM TAKE IT AWAY POPPY
IT'S IT'S PLUGGED IN
SO UM
NO PROBLEM
I'M SURE IT'S FINE
RIGHT UM ONE QUESTION
THIS UM SELF DESTRUCTIBLE UH METAL IT ALLOWS FOR RECYCLING MATERIALS
SO THAT UM SOMEONE COULD HAVE THIS PRODUCT FOR AS LONG AS THEY FELT THAT THEY WANTED IT
AND THEN ONCE THEY CONTRIBUTE IT THEN THAT COMPANY CAN BREAK DOWN THE PART THE PARTS BETTER
YEAH
MM-HMM
WOULD WE BE THE COMPANY THAT WOULD BREAK DOWN THESE OR UH METALS
OR WOULD WE CONTRIBUTE TO ANOTHER GROUP
ALRIGHT
OKAY
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GREAT IDEA
ONE THING WE HAVE TO CONSIDER IS OUR UH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT UM TURNOVER GOAL THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR FINANCIAL SECTOR
UM SO WE'LL HAVE TO INVESTIGATE HOW MUCH THAT WILL COST US COST THE COMPANY UM 'CAUSE IT SOUNDS VERY LABOUR INTENSIVE
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HIRE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND IT MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
WE'LL STILL HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS
ALRIGHT
I LIKE THE ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACH
UM WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF THAT CAN MEET OUR FINANCIAL GOALS AS WELL
I'M SORRY COULD YOU THOSE WERE UM
OKAY
SO THOSE ARE WHAT UM WE'LL C CONSTRUCT THE REMOTE
THOSE ARE ALL THE
ALRIGHT
GREAT
ALRIGHT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND UM THE NEXT PRESENTER WILL BE TARA
YEAH
FUNCTION F. EIGHT
SORRY
YEAH
RIGHT
DOES EVERYONE AGREE WITH THIS
DOES ANYONE OBJECT AND AND FIND THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY TO GO
MM-HMM
YEAH
ALRIGHT
SOUNDS GREAT
ALRIGHT WELL UM ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR PRESENTATION GENEVIEVE
FABULOUS
EXCEPT YOU'RE NOT HOOKED UP TO THE GREAT
NO PROBLEM WE CAN
I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THAT LAST THING THAT YOU JUST SAID
MM-HMM
I'M SORRY THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY
YOU MEAN THAT THEY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY ON A FANCY LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
ALRIGHT SO IT MIGHT BE VERY APPEALING IF UM WE HAVE VERY CONCISE BUTTONS
AND ANOTHER THING WITH UM LOTS OF SURFING WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK ON SOMETHING THAT COULD BE UM A LOT MORE DURABLE
BECAUSE I FIND WITH UM CHANNEL CHANGERS THAT UM A LOT OF THE NUMBERS GET RUBBED DOWN IF THEY'RE PRINTED ON THE BUTTON
YEAH
IT'S UM NO IT'S A BUTTON THAT YOU PRESS AND THEN YOU UH LIKE A MENU POPS UP
I HAVEN'T USED IT BEFORE BUT
MM
THAT'S RATHER SAD
YEP
I AGREE WITH UM IF WE'RE TARGETING YOUNG ADULTS THEN IT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK INTO
UM FINANCIALLY AND AND FUNCTIONALLY
UM AND ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE UM TRYING TO BE TRENDY GO WITH FASHIONS THINGS LIKE THAT
UM AGES LIKE FROM THIRTY FIVE TO SIXTY FIVE WHICH SHOW LOWER NUMBERS PROBABLY WON'T BE AS CONCERNED
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND SOMETHING THAT MIGHT FURTHER COMPLICATE IT IS THAT THE T. V. MAKES NOISE ITSELF
WONDER IF IT WOULD HAVE
YEAH
YEAH
IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR A SIMPLISTIC DESIGN IF WE NEED TO DECIDE IF THAT IS OUR UM INTENTION IS IS A SIMPLISTIC DESIGN
UM BECAUSE IF IF IT IS THEN I THINK VOICE UM VOICE ACTIVATED
YEAH AND THAT WOULD SORT OF NEGATE THE WHOLE REMOTE CONTROL THING
BECAUSE IF PEOPLE CAN ACTIVATE THE TELEVISION WITH THEIR VOICE THEN THEY WON'T BE USING A THEY WON'T BE TALKING INTO A REMOTE I'M SURE
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT AN L. C. D. SCREEN IS
I HAVE NO IDEA STILL
I'M SORRY
OH ON THE REMOTE
OKAY
YEAH
RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND IF ONE OF THE LARGEST UH OR MOST COMPLAINED ABOUT THING IS THAT IT TAKES SO LONG TO GET TO KNOW HOW TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL
I'M SURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN OR REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE JUST FURTHERING THAT PROBLEM
YEAH
ALRIGHT
OKAY
BEFORE WE GO INTO UH MORE DISCUSSION ON WE WANT THIS DESIGN TO LOOK LIKE I'VE RECEIVED SOME INFORMATION FROM THE MANAGEMENT THAT WILL AFFECT SOME OF OUR DECISIONS
UM FOR ONE THING BECAUSE HAVING CONTROLS WITH D. V. D. V. C. R. THAT SORT OF THING WOULD REALLY COMPLICATE THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM WE'VE DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE THEM AND MAKE IT A SPECIFIC JUST A SPECIFIC TELEVISION UM FUNCTION
WHICH IS GOOD AS AS WE'VE SORT OF DECIDED THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH THAT ANYWAY
UM FOR MANY REASONS
SO UM WE HAVE THAT DECISION SORT OF MADE FOR US
ANOTHER THING THAT MIGHT UM AFFECT OTHER DECISIONS IS THAT UM THE MANAGEMENT FEELS THAT TELETEXT IS OUTDATED BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE USING THE INTERNET NOW
AND SO UH WE WON'T CONCERN OURSELVES WITH UM NAVIGATING THE TELETEXT OPTION
YEP
OKAY SURE
YEAH I DO
I'M LOOKING AT LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW
THANK YOU
UM WELL I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR OR POSSIBILITY OF USING THE INTERNET WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL
BUT UM THEY WERE JUST PRETTY MUCH SAYING THAT THE TELETEXT WOULD NOT BE USED
ALRIGHT AND ANOTHER THING
THIS IS FOR THE DESIGN THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT IS THAT UM WE WANNA CREATE UM
MORE OF A SENSE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IS FROM OUR COMPANY
SO UM ALL THE REMOTE CONTROLS MUST HAVE OUR UM WE'LL INCORPORATE OUR LOGO AND COLOUR IN IN SOME WAY
SO UM PERHAPS UM OUR LOGO ON THE BOTTOM OR WHEREVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT WOULD LOOK GOOD
UM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE COLOUR OF OUR UM OF OUR COMPANY BUT ANOTHER THING IS THAT UM
WE NEED TO WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THAT COLOUR AND AND LOGO DECIDED UPON
UM I'M ASSUMING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ONE BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS MEETING I I WASN'T OFFERED A
LIKE A TYPE OF LOGO OR COLOUR SO IF THAT COULD BE UM SOMEWHERE ON THE DESIGN SO THAT WE CAN BE RECOGNISABLE
THE LITTLE R. R. YELLOW THING
OKAY
REAL REACTION
OKAY
UM YES THOSE ARE THE CHANGES
UM SO NOW WE NEED TO DISCUSS UM
AND COME TO A DECISION ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS OF OF HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE
I'M JUST GOING TO LOOK AT MY NOTES FOR A SECOND
UM WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON A TARGET GROUP AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO UM WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IT'LL JUST BE FOR THE TELEVISION
IT'LL IT WON'T HAVE TELETEXT
BUT UM YOU KNOW WE COULD DISCUSS UM THOSE OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP GENEVIEVE
IS THAT HOW MOST PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THAT
OKAY
YEAH BUT ANOTHER THING IS THAT IF WE'RE REACHING AN INTERNATIONAL CROWD UM
I KNOW FOR ONE THAT IN NORTH AMERICA THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TELETEXT SO IT'D BE REALLY SUPERFLUOUS
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES BESIDES THE U. K.
DO YOU KNOW IF ANYWHERE ELSE HAS IT
ALRIGHT
IT WAS A MANAGEMENT DECISION SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY MUCH OUT OF OUR HANDS AT THIS POINT
'KAY
SO I GUESS WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING RATHER SIMPLE
YEAH
I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GO AHEAD WITH THE ALARM SYSTEM IDEA THAT YOU HAD
'CAUSE I'M SURE THAT COULD BE INEX INEXPENSIVE BECAUSE WE COULD USE THE SAME KIND OF INFRARED
THE SAME SIGNAL THROUGH THAT AND IT COULD JUST LIKE MAKE A LITTLE BEEPING NOISE
IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE TO DO
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
I LIKE THAT IDEA
YEAH
THE BUTTON OH
MINOR DETAIL THERE
YEAH IT WOULD HAVE T
MM-HMM
YEAH
THEN IT WOULDN'T IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE IT WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE SAME RECEPTION ON THE REMOTE C CONTROL I GUESS
BUT THE ACTUAL DEVICE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ITS OWN INFRARED SIGNALLER
OKAY
MAYBE UM
PROBABLY I MEAN
THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT YOU'LL HAVE TO SORT THAT OUT
YEAH YOU'LL HAVE TO YEAH YOU'LL HAVE TO INVESTI DO SOME RESEARCH ON THAT ALRIGHT
GREAT
UM ALRIGHT AND I'M SURE THAT UM
UM THE GLOW IN THE DARK FLUORESCENT WHATEVER SYSTEM UM IS A GO AHEAD
IS EVERYONE INTERESTED IN THAT
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
BUT I MEAN
YEAH
YEAH
COULD WE SOMEHOW WE COULD MAY POSSIBLY SORRY
INCORPORATE THEM BOTH SO THAT THE BUTTONS COULD MAYBE BE IN THE SHAPE OF THE NUMBERS THEMSELVES AND BE MADE OUT OF SOME GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL
'CAUSE I D I DON'T THINK THAT GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL UM LIKE THE ACTUAL SOFT PLASTIC UM COSTS THAT MUCH MORE THAN OTHER COLOURS
YEAH
ALRIGHT WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT
UM FOR THE MEETING BUT I THINK WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS LIGHT SUBJECT A LITTLE BIT MORE BEFORE WE CLOSE
UM WHAT WAS I MISSED THE LAST MOMENT READING THAT
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT WITH THE LIGHTING UP BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH
MM
SO IT COULD BE ANY BUTTON THAT WOULD BE PRESSED
YEAH
OKAY SO THAT'S PROBABLY FEASIBLE
SO DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO THE LIGHTING UP THING AND THE GLOW IN THE DARK THING AND THE SHAPE OF THE NUMBERS
DO WE HAVE TO KIND OF DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THIS
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
AND IT COULD IF IT'S THAT SOFTER RUBBER MATERIAL IT'LL BE MAYBE UM UH
BETTER FOR PEOPLE WITH UM ELS NO WHAT'S IT CALLED R. S. I. WHAT WAS IT THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
YEAH
YEAH INSTEAD OF LIKE HARD BUTTONS
OKAY
UM DID WE WANT TO GO FOR THE GLOW IN THE DARK LOOK
OR DID WE WANT TO GO FOR THE LIGHTING UP INSTANTLY
LIKE SHOULD WE DO BOTH
OR WE CAN HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER
BECAUSE IT MIGHT FOR FOR OUR DESIGN PURPOSES I MEAN THE LIGHTING UP THING MIGHT BE BETTER BECAUSE GLOW IN THE DARK MATERIAL HAS A FUNNY KINDA COLOUR
AND IT MIGHT NOT GO WITH DIFFERENT LIKE FACE PLATES THAT WE MIGHT COME UP WITH
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
SO WE'VE DECIDED ON LIGHTING UP THINGS
YEAH
YEAH
BUT WITH THE SAME THING I MEAN
IF YOU TOUCH THE BUTTON AND THEN IT COULD BE IT COULD BE LIT UP AS WELL
IS ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT
OKAY
COOL
UM
ALRIGHT
SO I THINK THAT UM
THAT COMPLETES MOST OF OUR UM OUR MORE UH PRACTICAL DECISIONS
AND NOW IT'S UP TO DESIGNING
AND UM MAKING SURE THAT THIS CAN BE FEASIBLE
AND DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY
LIKE AN IPOD OR SOMETHING
OKAY
LIKE A CELLPHONE
YEAH
MM-HMM
ACCESSORIES
YEAH
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD INCORPORATE THAT
'CAUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE VERY EXPENSIVE AT ALL
YOU'D JUST GET ONE MOULD
THROW SOME PLASTIC IN IT YOU KNOW
YEAH
WELL THAT MIGHT BE COM PROBLEMATIC WITH UM COPYRIGHT ISSUES
SO IF IT TAKES OFF THEN WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL TRY THAT OUT
RIGHT
WE'LL HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH
LIKE AS OF YET THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH UM THE WAY IT'LL LOOK
UM DOES IT NEED TO BE REACHED A DE DO WE NEED TO REACH A DECISION ON THAT RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS
OKAY
IS IT DOES IT NEED TO BE UH DECIDED ON NOW
OR SHOULD WE
OKAY
GOOD
ALRIGHT THEN
ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO SAY BEFORE WE CLOSE
ALRIGHT WELL
LET'S HAVE LUNCH AND WE'LL DISCUSS THIS LATER
ALRIGHT
OKAY
YEAH
THAT'S OKAY
THAT'S OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
UM DO I NEED TO PLUGGED IN
F. OKAY
FUNCTION F. EIGHT
SORRY ABOUT THIS GUYS
'KAY
IS ON
RIGHT
OKAY
I WILL TAKE THIS TIME JUST TO APOLOGISE
I I ONLY UH RECEIVED MY EMAILS LATER ON
'CAUSE I WAS TOO BUSY CARRIED AWAY DOING MY OWN THING WHICH IS NOT OBVIOUSLY NOT A VERY GOOD PART OF A TEAM WORKING THING
BUT THERE WE GO
UM SO I WAS LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN
AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO AND WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO DO
AND IT NEEDS TO UM ALLOW A PERSON TO HAVE A PORTABLE DESI DEVICE SO THEY CAN CONTROL THE TELEVISION FROM WHEREVER THEY ARE
THEY DON'T NEED TO ACTUALLY MANUALLY TOUCH THE TELEVISION SET
SO IT GIVES THEM MUCH MORE FLEXIBILITY AND ALLOWS THEM TO BE WHERE THEY WANT TO BE
UM FROM
UH ON A FUNCTIONAL SIDE OF THINGS WE FOUND OUT THAT WH FROM OUR PREVIOUS MEETING
WE DECIDED THAT THERE'RE CERTAIN POINTS THAT WILL MAKE OUR PRODUCT UNIQUE
UM ONE IS THE VISIBILITY IN THE DARK WHICH WAS UM GENEVIEVE'S IDEA
SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE COULD BRING THIS IN UM TECHNICALLY
AND WE COULD USE ILLUMINATED BUTTONS WHICH WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH WHEN WE'RE USING A MOBILE PHONE OR UM SOMETHING FAM FAMILIAR
A AUTOMATICALLY UM LIGHTS UP AT FIRST TOUCH
OR WE COULD USE FLUORESCENT MATERIALS WHICH WOULD JUST UM TAKE IN THE LIGHT DURING THE DAY
AND THEN AS SOON AS THEY GO OFF THEY WOULD GLOW IN THE DARK
UM ALSO WE COULD USE UM AN ALARM
SO IF WE LOST THE UM REMOTE CONTROL PERHAPS THERE COULD BE A BUTTON ON THE TELEVISION SET ITSELF
WHICH YOU COULD PRESS AND THEN AN ALARM FROM THE HANDSET WOULD SOUND WHERE IT WAS HOPEFULLY IN THE ROOM
MAYBE BEHIND A CUSHION OR SOMEWHERE
UM SO THAT WOULD WORK
UM OOP
GO BACK THERE
UM ANOTHER THING I THINK WE D MISSED OUT ON ON THE LAST MEETING WAS THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR DESIGN
UM FROM PREVIOUS RESEARCHES I'VE CARRIED OUT ON OTHER PROJECTS UM WE'VE LEARNT ABOUT SMART MATERIALS WHERE UM UM SPECIFIC ALLOYS OF METALS HAVE A SHAPE MEMORY
SO THEY CAN BE HEATED AND UM AND COOLED AND THEY CHANGE THE SHAPE OF UM THE METAL
SO FOR EXAMPLE A SCREW THAT'S HOLDING SOMETHING TOGETHER COULD EXPAND AND IT WOULD FORCE ALL THE COMPONENTS APART
SO UM THE BENEFITS OF THIS FOR OUR PRODUCT WOULD BE THAT WHEN IT CAME TO THE END OF ITS PRODUCT LIFE
IF IT WAS HEATED UM EVERYTHING WOULD SPRING APART
SO ALL THE UM INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS COULD BE EASILY SEPARATED
AND THEN SOME COULD BE REUSED SOME COULD BE RECYCLED AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR PRODUCTS NOW
ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE THERE'S MUCH UH RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THE UM COMPANIES WHO ARE COMING UP WITH LIKE NEW DESIGNS
'CAUSE ALL WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR RESOURCES ARE BEING LIMITED AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS
YEAH
UM
AND THEN
YEAH
YEAH THEY WOULD UM YOU WOULD MAKE THE THE PRODUCT AS YOU NORMALLY WOULD
APART FROM THE THE BITS THAT HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER WOULD BE MADE OUT OF THIS SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY
AND THAT'S THE PART THAT WOULD UM ALLOW ALL THE OTHER PARTS TO BE SEPARATED AT THE END
I MEAN THE USER WOULD RETURN THE P PRODUCT TO THE COMPANY 'CAUSE IT'S THE PRODUCT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO GET RID OF WHAT THEY'VE MADE
UM AND THEN THE COMPANY COULD THEN JUST USE MAKE USE OF THIS SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS TO SPLIT UP THE COMPONENTS
AND THEN EITHER REUSE SOME BITS AND OTHER BITS WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY GONNA WEAR OUT WITH TIME
OR NOT USABLE THEY MIGHT BE LIKE BE ABLE TO PUT INTO SCRAP METAL
SOMETHING LIKE THE CASE IF IT'S SCRATCHED OR SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO REUSE IT
BUT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO MELT IT DOWN AND REUSE IT AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE
YOU COULD WE COULD PROBABLY EMPL EM EMPLOY A A SIDE COMPANY OR SOMETHING TO DO THAT FOR US
BUT IT WOULD BE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THAT DONE AND TO DISPOSE OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE MADE
FOR A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE AT LEAST
NOT EVERY NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF EVERYTHING WE PRODUCE BUT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THE FACT OF THE SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS IS THAT THEY THEY DON'T NEED TO BE MANUALLY DE UM DECONSTRUCTED
LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO INDIVIDUALLY UM UNSCREW ALL THE SCREWS
BECAUSE OF THIS THEIR PROPERTIES ARE SMART MATERIAL
ALL YOU NEED IS JUST THE HEAT SO THEY SELF DESTRUCT THEMSELVES
SO I SUPPOSE IT DOES NEED LIKE HIGH CONTACT YEAH YOU KNOW HIGH UH QUALITY MACHINERY AND VERY SPECIFIC MACHINERY BUT
YEAH
OKAY
UM ALSO
THERE IS UM COMPONENTS
THIS'LL BE HOW IT UH WILL ACTUALLY WORK
BUT I HAVEN'T PUT THIS PLAN TOGETHER YET
THERE WE GO
SORRY SHOULD I GO BACK
THIS WOULD ACTUALLY SHOW THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM
ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T COME UP WITH THE FINAL CIRCUIT YET
SO I JUST PUT ALL THOSE COMPONENTS IN
YEAH
I IT JUST SHOWS WHAT SORT OF ENERGY SOURCE
IT COULD BE A BATTERY LIKE RECHARGEABLE PROBABLY
UM AN' YEAH WELL HOW THE INFRARED WILL ACTUALLY BE SENT THROUGH THE CHIP TO BE RECEIVED BY THE CHIP ON THE TELEVISION SET ITSELF
OKAY
SO NOW IS IT F. EIGHT AGAIN TO ESCAPE
OR ESCAPE
THERE WE GO
OKAY
THANK YOU
THERE YOU GO TARA
FUNCTION F. EIGHT
THE ONE AT THE TOP
UM I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE WHAT WHAT GENEVIEVE SAID BEFORE ABOUT HAVING LIKE SOME HIDDEN CONTROLS LIKE HAVING THE OUTER CASING
AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY UM I D WELL WELL WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE ABOUT IT BEING A MORE PROFITABLE SIMPLISTIC DESIGN
I SUPPOSE HAVING THAT WOULD COMPLICATE IT A LOT MORE
AND LIMIT THE DESIGN
DO YOU THINK
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
THE SINGLE FUNCTION
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT
IT'S LIKE THE NEWS
OR LIKE INFORMATION
THE AND WHAT'S ON
IT'S LIKE
IT'S LIKE VERY BASIC INTERNET
SORT OF UM
YEAH IT'S JUST INFORMATION THAT UM LIKE TELEVISION TIMETABLES WHAT'S ON WHAT'S ON NOW WHAT'S ON NEXT ON EVERY CHANNEL AND
YEAH
TO GET THE RIGHT RECEPTION AND PICTURE I SUPPOSE
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
I THINK
OH I'M GUESSING THAT'S WHAT IT IS
I'M NOT
MM
YEAH
YEAH
IT IS
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
AND IF THERE WAS CONVERSATION IN THE ROOM AT THE SAME TIME ALTHOUGH IN THEORY IT DOESN'T TEND TO BE WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING TELEVISION
BUT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE SPECIFIC UH DESIGN
YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
WHAT WHAT WOULD APPEAR ON THE SCREEN
LIKE LINKED IN WITH THE TELETEXT OR SORT OF LIKE AN
TELETEXT AT YOUR FINGERS WITHOUT HAVING TO ACCESS THAT THROUGH THE TELEVISION
MM YEAH
COULD BE
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
COMPLICATED JUS COMPLICATING THINGS EVEN FO MM
OKAY
CAN I JUST INTERRUPT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLUG IN YOUR HAVE YOU GOT A POWERPOINT OR NOT
OKAY
THANKS
WERE THEY WAS THE MANAGEMENT SUGGESTING USE OF THE INTERNET RATHER THAN TELETEXT OR JUST AVOIDING BOTH ALTOGETHER
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
JUST
OKAY
WORK ON THAT
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
MORE RESEARCH REQUIRED I THINK
BUT IF WAS IT A MANAGEMENT DECISION THAT WE'RE HAVING OKAY
SO
OKAY
'KAY
MINIMAL
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
THE SAME SIGNALLING
I MEAN
OR VIBRATE JUST THE SAME AS A MOBILE PHONE
LIKE YOU JUST A A BUZZ OR SOMETHING
YEAH
IF DO YOU MEAN THE THE LINK BETWEEN THE WELL IF THE BUTTON WAS ACTUALLY ON
OH YEAH
MAYBE YEAH YEAH
MAYBE SOMETHING ADHESIVE THAT YOU COULD LIKE STICK ONTO THE BACK OF ANY SET THAT WOULD BE UM YEAH NOT VERY OBTRUSIVE
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING SMALL THAT'S YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
PR PROBABLY
UNLESS IT COULD BE OKAY
UM UNLESS SOME WAY IT COULD HAVE SOME UNIVERSAL CONNECTION TO LIKE THE SOCKET THE SAME SOCKET THAT THE T. V. 'S SUPPLIED FROM
I MEAN THE POWER FOR THE T. V.
SO MM MORE RESEARCH INTO THAT ONE
YEAH
Y
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE A RAISED
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
AND ALSO Y UH HEATHER YOU MENTIONED BEFORE UM LIKE HOW IT SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY
UM SO LIKE BIG B UM BUTTONS FOR PEOPLE YOU ARE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
THE GLOW IN THE DARK OR LIGHT UP WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE ANYWAY
SO LIKE YOU SAY TACTILE MIGHT BE BETTER BECAUSE IT'D BE MORE AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO IT'S NOT THESE DAYS
I MEAN IT'S QUITE EASILY ACCESSIBLE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO SELF TIMED LIGHTING
UM I
YEAH
SO SELF TIMED
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THE SHAPE OF THE NUMBERS IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA
AND I THINK THAT'S UN UNIQUE AS WELL
I MEAN I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT
AND AS YOU'RE SAYING LIKE NUMBERS CAN WEAR OFF IF THEY'RE JUST SORT OF LIKE PAINTED ON YOU KNOW PRINTED
DURABLE
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH AND WE COULD YEAH THERE ARE NOW LIKE LOADS
OR A HUGE RANGE OF DIFFERENT COLOURS THAT IT COULD LIGHT UP IN AS WELL WHICH COULD LIKE LINK IN WITH THE COMPANY COLOURS
LIKE IT COULD BE BLUE OR GREEN OR YELLOW OR LIKE WE'VE JUST LIMITED T WITH THE JUST ORDINARY PHOSPHORESCENT SO
YEAH
EVERY TIME THE THAT IT LIT UP YOU C THAT COULD LIGHT UP AS WELL
OR OR THE WHATE
YEAH
IS
OKAY
LIKE YOU CAN HAVE CHANGEABLE UM MOBILE COVERS OR SOMETHING
YEAH OR OKAY
YEAH
PERSON
YEAH
WELL THAT'S GREAT
INTERCHANGEABLE
UM ALS
YEAH
INTERCHAN
AND ALSO POSSIBLE I MEAN UH WE COULD GAIN OUT OF THAT BY ADVERTISING CERTAIN T. V. SHOWS OR
YEAH
BUT IF WE THERE IS YEAH
WE COULD UM THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR WE DIDN'T BRING THAT UP AGAIN
YEAH
UM I'VE
OKAY
LET'S
I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY LEAVE THAT 'TIL LATER ON THEN
NO
OKAY
THANK YOU
F. EIGHT W
FUNCTION F. EIGHT
THANKS
CAN YOU SEE
DO YOU THINK
IS IT UH FUNCTION EIGHT YEAH
OH RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
I'M THE USER UM
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
UH THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN OF THE APPARATUS IS THE EFFECT THE APPARATUS SHOULD HAVE
UM IN THIS CASE IT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION TELEVISION SET
BY TAKING INSPIRATION FROM OTHER SIMILAR DESIGNS WE'LL TRY AND COME UP WITH AN ORIGINAL TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS SELLABLE INTERNATIONAL
THERE'RE TWO FUNCTIONAL DESIGN OPTIONS
A MULTIFUNCTIONAL REMOTE CONTROL WHICH CAN BE USED FOR SEVERAL ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES
AND A SINGLE FUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL USED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE TELEVISION
SORRY
UM A SINGLE FUNCTION JUST FOR THE TELEVISION ITSELF
YEAH
UM MULTIFUNCTIONAL CONTROLS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO USE AS THE MULTITUDE OF BUTTONS CAN BE CONFUSING
A SINGLE FUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL IS SIMPLER TO USE BUT IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS FOR YOUR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES
UM I THINK THAT A SINGLE FUNCTION REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE PREFERABLE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO USE
IT'D BE MORE COMPATIBLE WITH A RANGE OF TELEVISION SETS MAKING IT MORE INTERNATIONALLY SELLABLE
UM IT WILL MAKE AN ORIGINAL DESIGN MORE OBTAINABLE AS WE HAVE LESS FUNCTIONAL NECESSITIES TO INCLUDE IN THE DESIGN
AND IT WOULD BE MORE PROFITABLE AS IT WOULD BE MORE SIMPLISTIC
AND LESS FUNCTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE INCLUDED
SO IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO MAKE
AND PROBABLY MORE SELLABLE JUST BECAUSE IT'S MORE COMPATIBLE WITH A R A WIDER RANGE OF DEVICES
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
WELL IT'S JUST THAT WHEN WE'RE CREATING IT WE'RE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT UM COMPATIBLE WITH DIFFERENT BRANDS OF DEVICES
AND IT WOULD BE EASIER TO MAKE IT COMPATIBLE WITH JUST DIFFERENT BRANDS OF TELEVISION DEVICES RATHER THAN OTHER ENT YEAH OTHER ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND WITH THIS WE'LL HAVE MORE ROOM IN THE BUDGET PROBABLY TO MAKE A MORE ORIGINAL DESIGN
WE'LL HAVE MORE MONEY TO GO INTO THE DESIGN SIDE OF IT
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S UM
IT HAS T. V. HAS LIKE INFORMATION IT HAS INFORMATION ON HOLIDAYS THE NEWS ENTERTAINMENT
NO LI YEAH
YEAH
AND YOU HAVE PAGE NUMBERS LIKE FOR THE MENU AND YOU PRESS THE PAGE NUMBERS WITH YOUR REMOTE AND IT IT'LL COME UP
VERY BASIC INTERNET YEAH
BUT YOU HAVE YEAH
BUT YOU HAVE NO INTERACTION BACK WITH IT YOU KNOW
LIKE THE INTERNET YOU CAN SEND EMAILS AND YOU'VE NO INTERACTION
YEAH
YEAH
UH PROBABLY JUST TUNING IN THE CHANNELS WOULD IT BE
TUNING THEM IN AT THE VERY START
YOU KNOW IF YOU GET A NEW T. V. SET YOU TUNE IN ALL THE CHANNELS DO YOU TH DO YOU THINK
YEAH
YEAH
REPETI UH
YEAH YEAH
I THINK IT IS
YEAH
MOBILE PHONE
YEAH
YEAH
COULD IT IT IT WOULD BE GOOD IF IT HAD THE ACTUAL PROGRAMME THAT WAS ON AND WHAT WAS NEXT
BUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE
YEAH
THAT WOULD BE GOOD YEAH
YEAH
MIGHT BE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT THOUGH
AND WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS MIGHT NOT HAVE TWENTY FIVE EUROS TO SPEND ON A REMOTE CONTROL
LIKE THEIR PRIORITIES MIGHT NOT BE A FANCY REMOTE CONTROL WHEN THEY'RE JUST STARTING OUT AND YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
EARLY TWENTIES THAT'S THE KIND OF AGE GROUP
TWENTIES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT WOULD BE ANNOYING THOUGH IF I DON'T USE TELETEXT THAT MUCH
BUT IF IT WAS ON YOUR T. V. YOU'D WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT IF
YOU'D YEAH
SO IS IT JUST OKAY
ALRIGHT
RIGHT
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
OKAY THEN
YEAH
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO UM PUT THE LITTLE DEVICE ANYWHERE
'CAUSE UH ISN'T OUR REMOTE CONTROL FOR
ALL T. V. S SO
YOU'D HA
YEAH WITH THE BUTTON THAT YOU PRESSED
YEAH
C 'CAUSE THEN IT WOULD ONLY BE A APPLICABLE TO ONE T. V. SET SO IT WOULD NEED TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD STICK SOMEWHERE OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WOULD IT NEED A BATTERY THEN
YEAH
I I LIKE THE LIGHT UP SUGGESTION
I THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER
'CAUSE YOU KNOW THE WAY FLUORESCENT LIGHTS LOSE THEIR BRIGHTNESS AFTER CERTAIN TIME SO
I WOULD GO FOR
WELL JUST THE NUMBERS COULD BE EMBOSSED COULDN'T IT
LIKE RAISED
YEAH
COULD BE RAISED
JUST LITTLE ARROWS THAT YOU COULD FEEL MAYBE
YEAH
YEAH
THAT I THINK THAT'S GOOD YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO I WOULDN'T SAY SO
THAT'S GOOD YEAH THAT A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
YEAH
THAT YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
YEAH
FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED YEAH
YEAH
IF
I WAS THINKING THOUGH IF IT WAS GLOW IN THE DARK YOU COULD PUT THE UM REAL REACTION SYMBOL AS GLOW IN THE DARK AND THEN IT WOULD BE CONSTANTLY ADVERTISED
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OH YEAH
INTERCHANGEABLE THING
THAT WOULD BE GOOD
YEAH
YEAH AND THEN THAT WOULD BE UH MORE PROFITABLE LIKE AS A SIDELINE TO THE REMOTE AS WELL
Y COULD BUY EXTRA
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
NO
OH YEAH
IF W
NO
OKAY
OH
FUNCTION F. EIGHT
THAT LOOKS RIGHT
I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE
MULTIFUNCTIONAL AND
CH OH I SEE
'KAY
SO AS FAR AS WE KNOW UM A SINGLE FUNCTION TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL IS US USABLE INTERNATIONALLY
RIGHT
D. V. D. S AND V. C. R.
OKAY
YEAH I THINK I AGREE WITH THE SINGLE DESIGN THING FOR NOW BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO MUCH THAT IF WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A UNIQUE
USER FRIENDLY DADADA AND IT'S ALSO MULTI ALSO MULTIFUNCTIONAL UM WE'RE GONNA GO OVER BUDGET FOR ONE THING
SO
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
YES I AM
OH I'M NOT HOOKED UP BUT OTHER THAN THAT COMPLETELY READY
OKAY
OKAY
OH
I JUST LOST MY MICROPHONE
JUST A MOMENT
OKAY
SO I'LL BE DISCUSSING THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL
UM AND I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BRIEFING ON WHAT THAT MEANS EXACTLY
UM IF YOU ALL REMEMBER FROM THE EMAIL WE GOT BEFORE OUR VERY FIRST UH KICK OFF MEETING WITH THE COFFEE MACHINE
THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THAT WAS TO PRODUCE HOT COFFEE QUICKLY
UM SO WHAT I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS THE EQUIVALENT FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
UM SO BASICALLY WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED
UM I'VE DONE SOME MARKETING RESEARCH A LOT OF INTERVIEWS WITH REMOTE CONTROL USERS UM AND SOME INTERNET RESEARCH
AND I'LL SHOW YOU MY FINDINGS
OH AND FIRSTLY I WANTED TO REMIND YOU ABOUT OUR COMPANY MOTTO AND PURPOSE
SO WE BELIEVE IN PROVIDING INTERNATIONAL MARKET WITH FASHIONABLE PRODUCTS
UM HENCE OUR MOTTO WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
SO I THINK THAT SHOULD BE OUR PRIORITY HERE
UM AND WE SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKING TO TRENDS IN CLOTHING AND INTERIOR DESIGN
NOT JUST IN ELECTRONIC FASHION
SO THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT FITS IN THE HOUSEHOLD
UM WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TOWARDS TRENDS IN BOTH CLOTHING AND INTERIOR DESIGN
ANY TRENDS THAT ARE GOING ON IN IN THE PUBLIC EVEN MEDIA YOU KNOW WHO'S FAMOUS
WHAT T. V. SHOWS ARE BEING WATCHED UM TO INFLUENCE OUR REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY SO THE FINDINGS
UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS OF REMOTE CONTROLS FIND THEM UGLY
WHICH IS A QUITE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER
UM THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DIDN'T SPECIFY IF THEY LOVE THEM OR FOUND THEM YOU KNOW NEUTRAL
EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY
CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER
YEAH THEY'RE WILLING THEY'RE WILLING TO SPEND MONEY ON A REMOTE CONTROL WITH PERSONALITY
AS OPPOSED TO YOUR BASIC YOU KNOW OVAL BLACK ALL SAME SIZE BUTTON REMOTE CONTROL
UM SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IGNORED IN THE HOUSEHOLD
UM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF REMOTE CONTROL USERS SAID THAT THEY ZAP A LOT
ZAPPING MEANING THEY GO THROUGH CHANNELS A LOT
THEY'RE YOU KNOW THUMB MASTERS
UM AND FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS SAY THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
THAT A VERY SMALL AMOUNT
THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING
YES
AND ACTUALLY TO GO WITH THAT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SOME STATISTICS ON THE UH RELEVANCY OF THE BUTTONS HOW MUCH THEY'RE USED
AND UH HOW IMPORTANT THE UH USERS FIND THEM
SO THE POWER BUTTON OBVIOUSLY IN AN HOUR IS ONLY USED ONCE
HOPEFULLY THE PERSON'S NOT TURNING ON AND OFF THE T. V.
UM BUT THE RELEVANCE OF THAT BUTTON IS NINE OUT OF TEN
SO PEOPLE WANNA BE ABLE TO TURN ON THE T. V. WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM AS OPPOSED TO STANDING UP AND TURNING ON THE TELEVISION SET
CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES ON AVERAGE PER HOUR
THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTON
UM SO OBVIOUSLY WHEN COMMERCIALS COME ON THEY'RE CHANGING IT SO AS YOU SAID WE WANT A DURABLE BUTTON THAT'S NOT GONNA RUN DOWN
RELEVANCE OF THAT BUTTON OUR USERS FOUND WAS UH TEN TEN OUT OF TEN
UH DITTO FOR VOLUME SELECTION SO TEN OUT OF TEN
AND IT'S USED ON AVERAGE FOUR TIMES AN HOUR
NOT AS MUCH AS CHANNEL SELECTION BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT
UM AUDIO SETTINGS IS USED ON AVERAGE ZERO POINT EIGHT TIMES AN HOUR
RELEVANCE IS TWO
SCREEN SETTINGS WHICH MEANS BRIGHTNESS COLOUR ETCETERA ZERO POINT FIVE TIMES AN HOUR
UM AND RELEVANCE OF ONE POINT FIVE
WE'RE GETTING TO SPECIFIC STATISTICS HERE
TELETEXT UM NOW I'M NOT TOO CLEAR ON WHAT THAT IS
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HELP ME
FLIPPING PAGES
IS THAT
SO LIKE A RUNNING BANNER UNDERNEATH
OH
OKAY
OKAY
LIKE TELLS YOU THE WEATHER AND OKAY
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
WELL I GUESS I'M NOT WITH IT BECAUSE I WASN'T BUT IT'S IT'S BEING USED FOURTEEN TIMES AN HOUR
UM AND HAS A R A HIGH RELEVANCE OF SIX POINT FIVE
SO IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA WANT TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON AND INCLUDE ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL
UM CHANNEL SETTINGS
ZERO POINT ZERO ONE TIMES AN HOUR
RELEVANCE OF THREE
CHANNEL SETTINGS
P SORRY
CHANGING THE CHANNELS
OH OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
UM SO IT'S NOT USED VERY OFTEN BUT PEOPLE STILL FIND IT RELEVANT
OKAY
UM BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS OF UH THE PEOPLE THAT WE INTERVIEWED
REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE
SO THAT WAS ALREADY DISCUSSED BY POPPY
HOW WE COULD HAVE A AN ALARM SYSTEM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND IT
UM TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT SHOULD BE VERY USER FRIENDLY YOU KNOW
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT TO DO VERY QUICKLY
UM REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR R. S. I.
AH
IS THAT WHAT IT IS
PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS AND SUCH
UM MAYBE OUR
DESIGNERS CAN LOOK INTO THAT
UM BUTTONS THAT DON'T REQUIRE YOU KNOW VERY FIRM PUSHING IF THEY RESPOND
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO ALSO AVOID YOU KNOW BUTTONS RESPONDING TO THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH AS WELL
THAT'S A PROBLEM
OKAY
DID YOU GUYS UH GET THAT ONE DOWN
UM OKAY HERE'S SOME IDEAS FOR YOU
A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PUBLIC WOULD PAY FOR VOICE RECOGNITION ON THE REMOTE CONTROLS
SO I'LL SHOW YOU SOME NUMBERS HERE
UM SO THE YOUNGEST AGE GROUP FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
NINETY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE VOICE RECOGNI VOICE RECOGNITION INCLUDED ON THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
UM AND YOU CAN SEE THAT NUMBER DECREASES A BIT WITH OL S INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE IS THE LOWEST AMOUNT
UM THAT WOULD ARE WILLING TO PAY EXTRA
SO I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AGE GROUP WE'RE WE'RE TARGETING AND IF AND IF VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING WE WANNA LOOK INTO
AND IF WE HAVE THE BUDGET FOR IT
UM IF WE ARE TARGETING YOUNG ADULTS IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD PAY OFF
SEEING AS NINETY PERCENT OVER NINETY PERCENT WOULD PAY FOR IT
MM-HMM
SO THAT THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER FIELD OF RESEARCH
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'D BE IF WE'D STILL HAVE A REMOTE OR IF YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR TELEVISION AND SAYING CHANGE CHANNEL
UM AND DEPENDING ON HOW MANY MEMBERS YOU HAVE IN HOUSEHOLDS
SO IT M IT MAY BE TOO COMPLICATED FOR US BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND ANYWAY
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT LOOKS LIKE
MM-HMM
IT'D BE LIKE THE ULTIMATE REMOTE
UM OKAY
AND TH THE LAST THING HERE WAS A AN L. C. D. SCREEN
SO I MEAN VOICE RECOGNITION MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO EXTREME FOR US
NOT PRACTICAL
UM AN L. C. D. SCREEN THOUGH MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN SHIFT THROUGH PAGES KIND OF LI THE WAY THIS POWERPOINT IS WORKING
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE SO MANY BUTTONS TO DEAL WITH
OH SORRY JUST JUST A SCREEN LIKE A COMPUTER SCREEN
S OR LIKE UM
YEAH
OR LIKE AN ALARM CLOCK
YOU'D HAVE AN L. C. D. VERSUS JUST A A NORMAL CLOCK
OH JUST LIKE AN ELECTRONIC SCREEN
AS OPPOSED TO JUST BUTTONS
THERE WOULD BE LIKE A LITTLE LIKE ON YEAH
LIKE ON THE TOP OF A CELLPHONE THE THE LITTLE L. C. D. SCREEN
UM NOW THAT'S I I DUNNO EXACTLY WHAT EXACTLY WE'D PUT ON THERE
I GUESS THE CHANNEL THAT YOU'RE ON THE V THE VOLUME SETTING
MM-HMM
WELL I GUESS THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ALL TAKE BACK TO OUR RESPECTIVE RESEARCH
UM AND FINALLY WHOOPS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES AND THOUGHTS
UM I THINK OUR PRIORITY REALLY SHOULD BE UNIQUE DESIGN
UM WE WANT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WANT IN THEIR HOME
EVERY REMOTE CONTROL LOOKS THE SAME SO UH IN MY OPINION IT SHOULD BE UM USER FRIENDLY AND UNIQUE
SO THE OTHER STUFF MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO A LITTLE TOO GADGETY FOR SOME PEOPLE
UM I TH MYSELF VOICE RECOGNITION KIND OF SCARES ME OFF
SO IF WE'RE IF WE'RE AIMING TO MAKE THIS AN INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED PRODUCT UM AND FOR ALL THE OTHER THING IS LIKE AGE MARKET
I MEAN IF WE WANTED TO CONCENTRATE ON FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLDS WE COULD GO FOR THE FANCY STUFF
BUT IF WE WANNA MAKE FIFTY MILLION AND AND HAVE EVERYONE WANT THIS REMOTE CONTROL WE SHOULD MAYBE
STICK TO THE BASICS
MM-HMM
RIGHT
AND WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR RESEARCH
I MEAN YOU KNOW A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WOULD SAY YEAH I'D PAY EXTRA FOR VOICE RECOGNITION UNTIL THEY REALISE THAT'S THREE MONTHS ALLOWANCE
UM SO I I THINK I THINK THE OLDER GENERATIONS WE SHOULD BE CATERING TO A BIT MORE
YEAH
YEP
OKAY
THAT'S IT FOR THE MARKET RESEARCH
YEAH
MAYBE WE CAN DO THE
THERE YOU GO
OH COME BACK SCREEN
HMM
IT'S PROBABLY R. R. R. IN YELLOW
YEAH I THINK
OKAY SO I ARE WE GOING TO WRITE OFF THE L. C. D. OPTION
YEAH
OKAY
SO NO L. C. D. NO TELETEXT AND NO VOICE RECOGNITION
YEAH
NEVER HEARD OF IT
UM WELL I GUESS JUST FROM MY FINDINGS IT LOOKS LIKE WE WANNA MINIMISE BUTTONS
UM
AND THE WHAT WAS THE WORD THEY USED
F FINDABILITY IS IMPORTANT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
ON THE BUTTONS
IT DOESN'T IT COULD IT COULD BE A TACTILE THING AS WELL
UM RIGHT IF W IF WE'RE MINIMISING BUTTONS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE THEM ACTUALLY LARGER
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ON IT
S YOU KNOW LIKE UP ARROW DOWN ARROW FOR FOR VOLUME
UM AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO FOR FOR CHANNELS
S
THE NUMBERS THEMSELVES
BUT THEN THE LIKE UP BUTTON AND DOWN BUTTON FOR THE CHANNEL CHANNEL CHANGING
YEAH
I JUST THOUGHT THAT IT IT MIGHT BE SUCKING MORE BATTERY POWER IF THERE IF IT IS A LIGHT UP
I'M NOT SURE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I GUESS THE OTHER OPTION REFERRING TO THE BATTERY THING IS YOU KNOW HOW CELLPHONES WILL T LIGHT UP FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS OR SOMETHING
WHEN YOU'RE S AND THEN IT GOES SO IF IF YOU'RE LIKE CHANGING THE VOLUME DURING A MOVIE
I KNOW I'M THINKING OF MOSTLY WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE YOU TURN ALL THE LIGHTS OFF RIGHT
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS TO TURN IT DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION AND IT'S GONNA WAKE UP THE BABY
UM SO IF YOU TOUCH THE BUTTON IT KIND OF REACTIVATES IT
IT LIGHTS UP FOR
ON SELF TIMER
YEAH
OH JUST IF IT WAS KINDA THE SAME WAY THAT A CELL YOU KNOW HOW A CELLPHONE WILL LIGHT UP FOR ABOUT TEN
FIFTEEN SECONDS WHEN YOU TOUCH A BUTTON AFTER HAVING NOT TOUCHED IT FOR A WHILE
UM IF INSTEAD OF A CONSTANT LIGHT UP ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IF IT LIGHTS UP FOR TEN SECONDS WHEN IT'S TOUCHED AGAIN
YEAH AND YOU YOU TOUCH IT AND IT JUST KIND OF LIGHTS UP A BIT AND IT GIVES A FAINT GLOW
SO IF YOU HAVE ALL THE LIGHTS OFF IN YOUR LIVING ROOM YOU'LL YOU'LL TEMPORARILY SEE IT
BECAUSE USUALLY YOU'RE NOT FOOLING AROUND FOR IT FOR MORE THAN WHAT TEN SECONDS
SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH RIGHT THE
MM-HMM
I WAS GONNA SAY
EXACTLY
IT THE IT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS TACKY GLOW IN THE DARK
IT'S KIND OF LIKE EIGHTIES NEON STYLE
UM WHEREAS WE'RE TRYING TO BE TRENDY AND FASHIONABLE
SO
MM-HMM
MM
THAT'S TRUE
WHAT UM OH SORRY
YEAH WELL I WAS JUST GONNA THROW OUT THERE THE THOUGHT ABOUT UM PERSONALISING THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM IT YOU 'CAUSE YOU MENTIONED FACE PLATES
SO I I DUNNO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
DIFF YOU KNOW LIKE FIVE DIFFERENT FACE PLATES
I DUNNO IF THIS WILL START MAKING IT MORE COMPLICATED BUT IT COULD INCREASE THE POPULARITY OF THE OF THE REMOTE
UM
YEAH
EXACTLY LIKE AN IPOD
EXACTLY
OR OR LIKE MOBILE PH
AND I DUNNO IF WE'D WANT TO GO WITH LIKE T. V. SHOW THEMES OR SOMETHING
LIKE A BART SIMPSON FACEPLATE
BUT
MM-HMM
EXACTLY
YOU COULD START OUT WITH THREE AND IF IF WE HIT IT BIG THEN WE CAN ADD SOME ON
MM-HMM
RIGHT
RIGHT
IS EVERYONE READY TO START
OKAY
GREAT
WELL WELCOME TO THE THIRD MEETING OF CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
I'LL JUST GET THE POWERPOINT PRESENTATION UP AND RUNNING
OKAY
UM ON THE AGENDA FOR THIS UM FOR THIS PARTICULAR MEETING WE'LL HAVE YOUR THREE PRESENTATIONS ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE SINCE OUR LAST MEETING
AFTER WE CAME UP WITH UM SOME GENERAL IDEAS OF OUR DESIGN
AND UM THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME KEY DECISIONS ON
ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPT AND HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT WHAT UH MATERIALS WE'RE GONNA USE AND THAT SORT OF THING
THE MEETING WILL BE FORTY MINUTES LONG
AND UM WE WILL ONCE AGAIN HAVE POPPY AS OUR FIRST PRESENTER
ALRIGHT AND I WILL SWITCH UP POWERPOINT
OKAY
UM
ARE THEY ALL INCLUDED LIKE MANDATORILY OR R ARE THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS
YEAH
MM
UM
WHAT IS A HAND POWERED DYNAMO
JUST EVERY EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
JUST EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE OR CONSTANTLY
ALRIGHT
IT'D BE KIND OF STRANGE TO ALWAYS BE CRANKING IT I THINK
NO
RIGHT
RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
UM ONE THING WITH THE SCROLL BUTTONS THOUGH
IT IT WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN L. C. D. UM
DISPLAY AND THE GLOW IN THE DARK THING
MIGHT BE DIFFICULT
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
UH
YEAH
UM ONE CONCERN WITH THE RUBBER CASING IS THAT IT WOULD BE RUBBER ENCAPSULATING ALL OF THESE CHIPS AND DIODES AND DELICATE TECHNOLOGY AS
LIKE AS THE EXTERIOR
THIS IS THE ONE THING THAT'S PROTECTING ITS INNARDS
YEAH
ANOTHER THING IS IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT IF IT'S A RUBBER EXTERIOR TALKING ABOUT PUTTING ON INTERCHANGEABLE PLATES
UM IS IT I DON'T SEE HOW A LIKE A RUBBER PLATE GOING ON TOP IT WOULD STAY THERE
LIKE IF IT WAS SORT OF LIKE A CLIP ON PLASTIC PLATE
IT WOULD WORK THAT WAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
SO MAYBE THE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT SOUNDS GOOD
I UM IS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT DESIGNS ONTO THIS TYPE OF RUBBER
OKAY WE'LL JUST SAY YEAH
YES JUST WHY NOT
ALRIGHT
I LIKE THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE IDEA
UM I DON'T KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WILL UM BE MOVING A REMOTE AROUND A LOT
BUT I THINK THAT IT'S WORTH IT KINETETY KINETIC UM
ENERGY SOURCE
IT COULD MAKE AN WE COULD HAVE ANY KIND OF STYLE
IT WOULDN'T BE AS HEAVY OR BULKY AND
YEAH
JUST FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN WATCH A T. V. IN THE DARK THEN
YEAH
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE IMPRACTICAL THOUGH
YEAH
LIKE PEOPLE DON'T WANNA HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OR JUST LIKE PICK IT UP WHEN YOU'RE GONNA USE IT
YEAH
ALRIGHT
COOL
'S THAT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION
ALRIGHT
THANK YOU
YEAH
THAT'S UM
OH
OKAY
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
YEAH 'CAUSE I'M SORRY
UM BECAUSE COMMAND INTERFACE REQUIRES YOU TO TYPE TEXTUAL COMMANDS AND INPUT AT A KEYBOARD SO THE NUMBERS ARE SORT OF LIKE A KEYBOARD
YOU'RE PRESSING THE NUMBERS FOR UM FOR WHAT YOU WANT
YEAH WE'LL BE DOING
YEAH
IT'D BE MORE A COMMAND INTERFACE AND THEN
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
I THINK THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT L. C. D. TYPE THINGS
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
OH YEAH LIKE HOW THE BUTTONS
YEAH AS A BUTTON THOUGH
SO IT'S A KEYBOARD IN THE SHAPE OF IT RIGHT
OKAY
YEAH
I LIKE THAT IDEA
YEAH
I'M SURE I LIKE KINETIC ENERGY WOULD PROBABLY DIP INTO THE BUDGET
A BIT MORE TOO YEAH
MM-HMM
DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD KEEP ALL THE BUTTONS TO ONE SAME COLOUR JUST TO KEEP IT GIVE IT A SIMPLISTIC LOOK
YEAH
YEAH
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LIGHTING UP EFFECT
UM WELL UM I THOUGHT WE HAD UM DECIDED THAT WE WOULD IF YOU TOUCHED ONE OF THE BUTTONS THEY'D ALL LIGHT UP
AND SO IF THEY WERE BLACK IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO LIGHT UP
IF THEY WERE WHITE THEY WOULD GLOW PROBABLY
IF THEY WERE MADE OUT OF RUBBER
OH
WHERE WOULD THE LIGHT COME FROM
YEAH
YEAH AND WELL RUBBER IS A MORE TRANSLUCENT PRODUCT TOO SO WE HAVE THAT TAKEN CARE OF
OH
MM
WELL IF THEY'RE RAISED UP BUTTONS
SO THAT YOU CAN FEEL THEM
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT BEING MORE
UM A LOT MORE TANGIBLE
UM IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT TO DO
IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE STICKING UP
IF IT'S FLAT THEN LIKE O LIKE ON A CELLPHONE OR A MOBILE PHONE
IT'S LIKE ALL VERY FLAT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO SORT OF PRESS DOWN ON THESE TINY LITTLE BUTTONS BUT
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
ALRIGHT
IF IT'S DO ABLE WE CAN DO
YEAH SOUNDS GOOD TO ME
ALRIGHT THANK YOU
THAT MEANS YOU'RE UP
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH IT'S THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IS THE ONLY
AREA THAT I FIND RATHER JARRING
EVERYTHING ELSE WE CAN REALLY WE CAN REALLY
UM DO ACCORDING TO OUR PLANS ALREADY GIVEN THE MARKET
BUT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SEEMS A VERY STRANGE IDEA FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THEY STILL NEED TO UM FIT INTO PEOPLE'S DECOR THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
TONE IT DOWN
YEAH LIKE MORE LIKE PHOTOS OF FRUIT ON ON OUR PRODUCT
MM-HMM
YEAH UM
ALRIGHT GIVEN THAT INFORMATION
WE NEED TO START MAKING SOME MORE SPECIFIC DECISIONS
SO I'LL NEED TO UM HOOK UP THE POWERPOINT AGAIN
BUT IT'S STILL AROUND RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE THIS POP UP NOW
ALRIGHT
HERE WE GO
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO UH DECIDE NOW EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
SO ENERGY WE OH
OH NO I CAN'T WRITE IT IN WHEN IT'S IN THIS SETTING
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO TAKE IT OUT OF
UM YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UM SO BACK TO DECISIONS
ENERGY WE'VE DECIDED ON KINETIC RIGHT
OKAY SO THAT'S GOOD
HMM
BUT WOULD A BACKUP REALLY BE NECESSARY
I MEAN WILL PEOPLE JUST USE THE BATTERY IF THERE'S NO IF THERE'S
IF THERE IS BACKUP
YEAH
YEAH
THERE'S LIKE NO REASON WHY IT WOULDN'T WORK RIGHT
YEAH
IT COULD EVEN BE ONE OF OUR SELLING POINTS
YEAH
YEAH
ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS OR SOMETHING
YEAH
ALRIGHT THE NEXT UM DECISION IS CHIP ON PRINT
I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
RIGHT AND WE WERE GOING FOR MORE SIMPLISTIC STYLE RIGHT
YEAH
I THINK WE DECIDED ON THE PUSHBUTTONS RIGHT
YEAH
WOULD WE NEED A MORE ADVANCED ONE FOR UH THE LIGHTING THE INTERIOR LIGHTING SYSTEM
YEAH
OKAY
THAT'S CALLED MEDIUM OR REGULAR
'KAY
OKAY AND CASES
UM DOES THIS IS THIS DEPENDENT ON SHAPE OR WHAT IT'S MADE OF OR WHAT
YEAH
WELL I GUESS PLASTIC AND COATED IN RUBBER
PLASTIC WITH RUBBER
COATING AND INTERCHANGEABLE
UM
YEAH INTERCHANGEABLE PLATES
OKAY
USER INTERFACE CONCEPT
THIS IS YOUR TIME TO SHINE
OH YEAH
YEAH
COMMAND INTERFACE
DID YOU SAY COMMAND LINE
OKAY
LINE INTERFACE
ALRIGHT AND SUPPLEMENTS
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT
UM
MM-HMM
UM WHAT ARE OUR CHOICES HERE
YOU MEAN LIKE WE'LL HAVE THE NUMBERS OF THE CHANNELS AND WE'LL HAVE THE CHANNEL CHANGER AND VOLUME AND POWER
UM
YEAH
LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD GO INTO LIKE ADJUSTING LIGHT LEVELS THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE DIFFERENT TELEVISIONS WILL HAVE
UM YEAH
YEP
YEAH IT WAS HARDLY EVER USED REALLY
YEAH
AND MOST TELEVISIONS WILL COME WITH A REMOTE
YEAH
'KAY WELL WE KNOW WE WANT NUMBERS
YEAH IT DOES
YEAH AND DIFFERENT TELEVISIONS
LIKE WE I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN MAKE A REMOTE THAT WOULD BE UNIVERSAL TO ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF
CHANGES LIKE THAT
VOLUME
YEAH
OH
WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO FINISH OUR MEETING
CRAP
OKAY UM LET'S DO THIS FAST
UM
SHOULD WE HAVE AUDIO
IT ONLY COMES UP ON MINE USUALLY
YEAH I DON'T I IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE INTERNATIONAL UH APPEAL I THINK
UM IF WE HAVE AUDIO BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER TELEVISIONS WORK
BUT WE KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS THIS AND IT'S THE SAME
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
GOOD
AND OKAY IN CLOSING 'CAUSE WE ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES
WE'LL BE MEETING AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES
UM
YOU'LL BE WORKING POPPY WILL BE WORKING ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
WAIT A MINUTE
IS THAT RIGHT
YEP AND UM THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN SO THIS IS WHERE THE TRENDY STUFF COMES IN
AND YOU'LL BE EVALUATING THE PRODUCT
UM
POPPY AND TARA WILL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER USING MODELLING CLAY
AND UM YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL GIVE YOU THE REST OF THE INFORMATION OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
ALRIGHT
SO ANYONE ELSE HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
FIVE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
LOTS OF YEAH
ALRIGHT
'KAY WE'LL STICK TO THE FRUIT AND VEGGIE THEME THEN
ALRIGHT
AND UM WE'LL RECONVENE IN THIRTY MINUTES
'KAY
BYE
I'LL SEE YOU LATER
OH WHAT DID I JUST DO
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
THANK YOU
SHOULD BE JUST LOADING
OKAY
OH ALTHOUGH I CAN'T SEE IT ON MY SCREEN
THAT SAYS GO HERE
OKAY
I'VE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH INTO THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT WE COULD USE UM WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO US F TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL IS ACTUALLY MADE
AND WHAT IS IT HAPPENS INSIDE THE CASING WHICH IS MORE YOUR FIELD
UM THES MAIN INTERNAL FEATURE IS A CIRCUIT BOARD WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE ELEC ELECTRONICS AND ALSO THE CONTACTS WITH THE POWER SOURCE
WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY A BATTERY AS WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE
UM THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF UM
THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHERE WE'LL BE GETTING THEM FROM WHAT THEY'LL BE MADE OF
UM INCLUDING THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE CHIP
WHICH IS WHERE ALL THE MAIN INFORMATION IS UH CONTAINED
UM DIODES TRANSISTORS RESONATORS RESISTORS AND CAPACIT CAPACITORS ALL NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL
UM AND ALL THEIR POSITIONING IN THE CIRCUIT
UH THESE THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT OPTIONS THEY'RE ALL SEPARATE APART FROM THE CHIP
WHICH WE WILL PROBABLE DECIDE WHETHER WE BUY A SIMPLE A REGULAR ADVANCED
WE CAN GO INTO THAT LATER
UM ALL THE OTHER THINGS ARE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS THAT WE'D HAVE TO GET IN SEPARATELY AND WORK OUT THE MOST
LIKE EFFECTIVE UM CIRCUIT INCLUDING ALL THE WIRES AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT
AND THE L. E. D. OF COURSE THAT'S A LIGHT EMITTING DIODE
SO WE COULD SO WE'VE GOT FLEX FLEXIBILITY WITH COLOURS AND THINGS WITH THAT AS WELL
OKAY THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE
WE COULD USE A BASIC BATTERY BUT THAT BRINGS WITH IT LIKE THEY NEED TO BE RECHARGED AND THE BULK THE SIZE OF IT AS WELL
AND THEY'RE NOT SO GREAT TO DISPOSE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY
THERE'S A HAND POWERED DYNAMO WHICH IS A SORT OF THING THAT WAS USED FOR TORCHES FIFTY YEARS AGO
A BIT OUT OF DATE
KINETIC ENERGY IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN RECENTLY DEVELOPED
UM WHERE YOU MANUALLY CHARGE UP THE POWER
LIKE YOU WIND UP SOMETHING
SORRY
YEAH
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I THINK
BUT IT'S
YEAH
IT WOULD BE LIKE GOING A STEP BACK IN TIME
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD REALLY BE WITH KIND OF CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WHEREAS KINETIC ENERGY IS A NEW IDEA THAT'S BEING USED BY SOME WATCHES AND OTHER DEVICES WHERE YOU JUST SHAKE THE DEVICE AND IT GIVES IT POWER
I MEAN THE KINETIC ENERGY IS TRANSFORMED INTO POWER TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT WORK
UM OR THERE'S SOLAR POWER WHICH WE'VE BEEN CONSIDERING INSIDE A BUILDING WHICH IS WHERE IT'S GONNA BE USED MIGHT NOT BE QUITE SO USEFUL
BUT GOOD TO LOOK INTO RENEWABLE ENERGY ALWAYS THE WAY
UM LOTS OF CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE CASE LIKE WHAT SORT OF SHAPE IT WOULD BE CURVED OR FLAT
THAT'S GOT A LOT TO DO WITH THE ERGONOMICS
LIKE HOW IT'S COMFORTABLE AND S SITS IN THE HAND
WE DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT'S HUGE AND YOU CAN'T PICK UP
OR TOO SMALL
OR TOO SLIDY
I KNOW I'VE HAD A REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE WHICH YOU COULDN'T TELL WHICH WAS THE FRONT AND THE BACK 'CAUSE IT HAD SO MANY BUTTONS ON
AND THE SHAPE WAS SO SYMMETRICAL THAT I'D BE PRESSING LIKE A VOLUME BUTTON INSTEAD OF THE ON BUTTON
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE WHICH WAY ROUND IT IS
UM WE ALSO CAN CHOOSE WHAT MATERIALS UM THE WE COULD USE METAL WE COULD USE RUBBER WHICH MIGHT BE MORE UM IDEAL FOR THE ANTI R. S. I.
IT'S LIKE THE SAME SORT OF RUBBER THAT'S USED IN STRESS BALLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S VERY LIKE SOFT NOT SO STRESSFUL ON YOUR HANDS
WOOD
UM AGAIN STEPPING BACK IN TIME AGAIN THERE
I DON'T THINK THAT'S QUITE UP TO DATE WITH WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE
UM TITANIUM IS NOT GONNA BE POSSIBLE EVEN THOUGH IT JUST IT BEYOND OUR BUDGET REALLY
BUT WOULD'VE BEEN MAYBE FOR FUTURE PROJECTS
UM RIGHT OUR CHOICE FOR BUTTONS AS WELL
WE'VE DEVELOPED SOME WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY WITH OUR RESEARCH TEAM HAVE FOUND SOME UH NEW MULTIPLE UM OPTION SCROLL BUTTONS
I THINK THAT WAS BROUGHT UP FOR UM THEY'RE BASICALLY QUITE A FLEXIBLE DESIGN MODERN YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS
YOU CAN JUST SLIDE UP AND DOWN
I'M SURE WE'RE ALL QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE ON MOBILES OR COMPUTER LAPTOP PADS
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
AND THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN ADVANCED YEAH
IF WE HAVE YEAH
WE'RE GOING ON TO THAT LATER WITH THE ADVANC WITH THE L. C. D. THAT MEANS WE'D NEED A REALLY ADVANCED CHIP
AND IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THAT'S GONNA BE IN OUR BUDGET
UM ALSO WE'VE GOT THE INTEGRATED PUSHBUTTON WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE MOST FAMILIAR WITH
IT'S THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD
BUT YOU CAN IN LIKE INCORPORATE THAT WITH A SCROLL BUTTON AS WELL
GOT DECISIONS TO MAKE THERE
AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING BEFORE
LINKED IN THE DIFFERENT DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF BUTTONS WE HAVE AND THE INPUTS
UM SIMPLE WOULD GO WITH THE PUSHBUTTON
UM REGULAR YOU COULD LINK WITH THE SCROLL BUTTON
AND THE ADVANCED WE'D HAVE TO GO WITH A L. C. D. S DISPLAY
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
I THINK WE COULD GO FOR THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE
I DON'T I THINK THAT'S QUITE UM AN ADVANCED KIND OF TECHNOLOGY
IT'S NOT BEEN SEEN BEFORE SO IT COULD BE QUITE A A NOVELTY FACTOR ATTRACTIVE AS WELL
AND ALSO ENERGY SAVING 'CAUSE YOU'RE PRODUCING THE ENERGY YOU DON'T NEED AN EXTERNAL SORT OF BATTERY SUPPLY OR SOLAR PANELS
YOU JUST GIVE IT A SHAKE
SOUNDS BRILLIANT TO ME
RUBBER CASING I THING WOULD PROBABLY THE BEST IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE ANTI R. S. I. AND LIKE MORE CHOICE WITH UM AESTHETICS
LIKE IT COULD BE PRETTY MUCH ANY COLOUR WE WANT
UM AND GIVES YOU YEAH MORE FLEXIBILITY THERE
AND PROBABLY THE REGULAR CHIP AS OPPOSED TO THE SIMPLE
THEN WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE THE SCROLL AND THE PUSH BUT NO L. C. D. 'CAUSE WE PROBABLY CAN'T AFFORD THAT ONE
MM-HMM
I THINK THAT WOULD UH THERE WOULD BE AN IN SORT OF MORE INTERNAL CASING
AND THE RUBBER WOULD JUST BE THE WHAT'S IN CONTACT WITH THE HUMAN
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE IF THE UM IF IT WAS JUST KIND OF A MORE OF A RUBBER COATING WHICH WAS ON TO A CASE
SO IT WAS KIND OF THE WHOLE THING WOULD BE REMOVABLE
YEAH
LIKE I CAN'T THINK OF WHAT
YEAH
OR LIKE AN YOU CAN GET SORT OF OUTER CASING FOR IPODS AND SOMETHING THAT'S JUST IT'S PROTECTIVE AS WELL
IT IT STOPS IT I MEAN IT WOULD REDUCE THE IMPACT IF IT WAS DROPPED OR SOMETHING
AS WELL 'CAUSE IT WOULDN'T DAMAGE ITSELF SO EASILY
I THINK I MAYBE A MIXTURE OF BOTH THERE MAYBE
YEAH
AND THEN YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AS FAR AS I KNOW
IT SHOULD BE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE AS A BACKUP FOR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
SOME ALTERNATIVE JUST IN CASE SOMETHING WENT WRONG
THAT'S TRUE
I JUST THOUGHT OF THAT
YEAH
YEAH
MAY MAYBE THAT COULD BE THE BACKUP
INSTEAD OF A BATTERY
LIKE SOLAR BACKUP
YEAH
I SUPPOSE S BUT SOME
BUT THING IS IT'S NOT YOU DON'T NEED THE SOLAR ALL THE TIME
IT CAN BE STORED
IT CAN BE LIKE YOU CAN HAVE THE SOLAR ENERGY AND THEN IT CAN STORE THAT ENERGY AND USE IT
IT JUST NEEDS TO BE IN LIGHT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME PER DAY
LIKE A FEW HOURS A DAY
THAT'S TRUE
IT COULD EASILY
YEAH
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE REALLY ANNOYING IF YOU GET TO THINK OH NO I FORGOT TO CHARGE MY REMOTE TODAY
LIKE IF THE KINETIC THING I THINK WHAT'S BEST ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT'S INSTANT ENERGY
YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU KNOW YOU CAN SHAKE IT A FEW TIMES OR WHATEVER
AND IT WORKS
YEAH
INSTEAD OF YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE MAKE SURE IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO CHARGE AND
K OKAY
YEAH
THERE WE GO
IT WASN'T ON MINE EITHER
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I THINK I JUST I JUST USED THE MOUSE ON THERE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
SO I SUPPOSE SOMETIME AFTER YOU
MM
I S I SUPPOSE WHERE UM MM ON SOME BUTTONS YOU WOULD HAVE LIKE THE POWER WOULD BE S SOME KIND OF SYMBOL
AND IF YOU WANTED TO GO ONTO TELETEXT OR I KNOW WE'RE NOT HAVING THAT BUT I MEAN A SIMILAR THING YOU
THEY HAVE THERE'S A LIKE LITTLE PICTURE WITH A SCREEN WITH LINES ACROSS IT
WHICH I SUPPOSE IT'S THAT SORT OF THING LIKE THE THE SYMBOL ON THE BUTTON
BUT IF WE'RE HAVING A SIMPLIFIED DISPLAY ANYWAY W THAT WE PROBABLY WON'T HAVE TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON THAT
IT'LL BE MORE THE ON THE NUMBERS AND THE VOLUME
I SUPPOSE WE NEED TO THINK OF SYMBOLS FOR LIKE THE VOLUME DISPLAY AND STUFF LIKE THAT
I
FOR INP
MM
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S IN LIKE THE BUTTONS WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT LIKE COLOURS FOR DIFFERENT CHOICES AND THINGS
IT CAN BE A BIT YEAH OVERWHELMING
YEP
OH
I'D ASSUME LIKE AN INTERNAL LIGHT THAT COMES THROUGH
SO THERE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE TO BE SOME PARTS MAYBE TRANSPARENT AROUND THE BUTTONS OR SOMETHING
YEAH YEAH
IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO MM-HMM
LI YEAH
MM-HMM
I THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE
I MEAN THE UH THE DIMENSIONS OF IT
'CAUSE IF IT'S JUST LIKE CONSTRUCTED IN THE SAME WAY AS LIKE THE FRONT COVER OF A MOBILE PHONE
YOU CAN LIKE TAKE OFF THE HARD COVER AND THEN THERE'S THE LIKE SAY THE BUTTONS
AND THEN YOU GET TO THE CIRCUIT
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MATTER THAT THE BUTTONS WERE BIGGER THROUGH THE THE TOP CASING
I'M SURE YOU COULD F WORK IT OUT TO FIT IN THE CASING WITHOUT CAUSING TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY
I'M SURE THAT'D BE FINE
OKAY
YOU'RE NOT PLUGGED IN YET
MM
IT IS STRANGE
WELL
WE
I THINK WE POSSIBLY COULD TAKE A MORE ABSTRACT DESIGN
LIKE LOOK AT THE BASIC SHAPES OF DIFFERENT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
AND THEN JUST REALLY LIKE STRIP IT DOWN TO LIKE REALLY BASIC SHAPES
I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING IN THE SHAPE OF A STRAWBERRY BUT IT COULD HAVE THE CURVES OF A STRAWBERRY OR SOMETHING
OR A STRAWBERRY SEED OR A LEAF
OR JUST LIKE YOU KNOW REALLY MAKE IT A QUITE ABSTRACT IF THAT'S FITS IN MORE WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING
INSTEAD OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES JUST IF YOU LOOK AT IT STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S A BIT YEAH
IT DOESN'T S QUITE FIT IN WITH THE TRENDY WELL OBVIOUSLY IT DOES IF THAT'S THE CURRENT THEME
BUT MAY MAYBE WE COULD GO MORE DIRECTLY I DON'T KNOW
BUT INITIALLY I DUNNO
I THINK IF WE JUST SORT OF TONE IT DOWN A BIT
YEAH AND LIKE NOT NOT YEAH
MM
YEAH
I DIDN'T FOR THE FIRST ONE
BUT I HAVE NOW
YEAH
UH HOPEFULLY
PROJECT DOCUMENTS I THINK
OKAY
'KAY
KINETIC YEAH
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A BACKUP
OR DO WE JUST
I THINK MAYBE WE COULD JUST GO FOR THE KINETIC ENERGY AND
BE BOLD AND INNOVATIVE AND HOPE THIS WORKS AND WELL HOPE THAT IT WORKS
I THINK YEAH
I THINK NO
I I THINK WE SHOULD JUST LIKE TAKE UH ADVANTAGE OF LIKE USING THIS TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL
GO FOR IT
IT COULD BE FULLY KINETIC ENERGY
YEAH
IS EVERYONE HAPPY WITH THAT
YEAH
UM IT WAS WHETHER WE WENT FOR THE SIMPLE THE REGULAR OR THE ADVANCED CHIP
AND THAT LINKED IN WITH WHAT BUTTONS WE WOULD GONNA HAVE SO
YEAH IT WAS SO THAT WAS WITHOUT THE L. C. D.
SO THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT DOING THE ADVANCED
SO IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE WANTED THE SCROLL BUTTONS OR JUST THE PUSH BUTTONS
UH SO THAT'S THE SIMPLE
YEAH POSSIBLY
SO IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE REGULAR CHIP THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED
SO IT'S A MEDIUM
SO REGULAR CHIP
REGULAR SORRY
REGULAR CHIP
LIGHTING
YEAH IF WE BECAUSE OF THE LIGHTING THAT WE'VE DECIDED TO PUT IN AS WELL
SO TH
I THINK THIS IS JUST LIKE GONNA BE THE A VERY OUTER CASE WHICH WE WILL DECIDE ON RUBBER
RUBBER
YEAH
PLASTIC RUBBER COAT
INTERCHANGEABLE YEAH
STILL GOING FOR THAT
YEAH
YOUR SCREEN
WAS IT
OUCH
THE POWER
VOLUME
MAY YEAH
TONE CONTRAST AND THINGS
THAT'S A BIT
YEAH IT WAS MINIMA WELL IT WASN'T THE L
YEAH
THAT WOULD BE GOOD
YEAH AND SURELY THAT WOULD BE LIKE QUITE SPECIFIC TO THE INDIVIDUAL TELEVISION SO
MM
I THINK MOST OF THAT COMES LIKE ON THE I INDIVIDUAL TELEVISION SET ITSELF DOESN'T IT
I'M SURE IT HAS ITS OWN BUTTONS SO YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO HAVE IT ON REMOTE
YEAH
SO WE'RE JUST GOING FOR POWER CHANNELS VOLUME
MM
I'VE
YEAH THAT'S IT
WE CAN JUST GO FOR MAKE IT A SELLING POINT THAT IT IS JUST THE BASIC
YEAH UH I BRILLIANT
MM-HMM
OKAY
UM I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE WHOLE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE ASPECT
ARE WE SEEING AS THAT WAS THE MOST POPULAR THING THAT CAME UP OUT OF YOUR MARKET RESEARCH
I THI I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP TO THAT RATHER THAN MOVING TO ANIMALS OR SOMETHING
BECAUSE EVEN IF THAT MAY NOT SEEM OBVIOUS TO US IF THAT'S WHAT THE SURVEYS BROUGHT OUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO ALONG WITH THAT
UM SO I SUPPOSE THAT'LL COME OUT IN OUR DEV DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
BUT YOU'RE HAPPY TO GO AHEAD WITH THE FRUIT AND VEG
Y YEAH
WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE IDEAS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
TRICKY
A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER
HM
OKAY
OKAY
THANK YOU
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
W
LIKE PLASTIC WITH RUBBER KIND OF ON TOP
WELL THERE'S THERE IS A CERTAIN PHONE THAT HAS LIKE A RUBBER CASING B LIKE A NOKIA IT IS
IT'S YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THA
BACKUP
YEAH
THAT WOULD BE GOOD YEAH
MAYBE WE COULD YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT UM SOLAR POWER MA MAYBE NOT WORKING INDOORS BUT A LOT OF CALCULATORS YEAH HAVE SOLAR POWER
SO MAYBE THAT COULD BE INCORPORATED AS
YEAH
DO DO THOSE CALCULATORS YEAH
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I SUPPOSE
YEAH
YEAH
THANKS
OH
IT'S NOT ON MY SCREEN
WHY
YOU DON'T KNOW WHY
OH OKAY
IS IT THAT ONE
UM I'M JUST GONNA GO THROUGH THE INTERFACE CONCEPT WITH YOUS NOW
UH FIRST OF ALL I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT A USER INTERFACE IS
IT'S THE ASPECTS OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM WHICH CAN BE SEEN OR OTHERWISE PERCEIVED FOR EXAMPLE HEARD OR FELT MAYBE OR BY THE HUMAN USER
AND IT'S ALSO THE COMMANDS THAT THE USER USES TO CONTROL ITS OPERATION AND TO INPUT DATA
UM THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF USER INTERFACES
THERE'S THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE WHICH EMPHASISES THE USE OF PICTURES FOR OUTPUT AND A POINTING DEVICE FOR EXAMPLE A MOUSE FOR INPUT CONTROL
SO THAT'S SORT OF LIKE THE SCROLL THING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
YEAH
I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THE PICTURES THAT MAYBE THAT'S ON AN L. C. D. SCREEN
OR MAYBE IT'S
THE THE BUTTONS OR PICTURES OR SOMETHING
DO YOU THINK IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU MUST FOR THE GRAPHICAL USER YOU MUST NEED SOME KIND OF PRESENTATION FOR THE GRAPHICS
LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO I THINK IT'S TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL SYMBOLS THAT ARE ON THE THAT'S ON THE BUTTONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND PER
WELL IT COULD BE A WEE SCROLLER THING AND SOMETHING COULD COME UP ON THE SCREEN
YEAH
BUT UM
I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THE COMMAND INTERFACE ANYWAY TO MAKE IT MORE SIMPLISTIC
BUT THE WE COULD INCORPORATE SOME OF THE GRAPHICAL USER UM POINTS AS IN JUST TO MAKE IT M UM NICER TO LOOK AT MAYBE
LIKE I CAN'T THINK OF AN EXAMPLE BUT
SORT OF LIKE LITTLE PICTURES RATHER THAN
LIKE A LITTLE SOUND
INSTEAD OF SAYING VOLUME LIKE A LITTLE SPEAKER OR SOMETHING
YEAH SOMETHING Y
YEAH M PERHA YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE
UM THE CO UH WE'VE DECIDED THAT THE COMMAND INTERFACE WOULD BE THE MOST USEFUL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
AS IT WOULD BE LESS COMPLICATED AND THE CONTROLS WOULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
UM THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE CHEAPER TO DESIGN SO THAT WE'D HAVE MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO
UM TARGET THE DESIGN AREA OF THE INTERFACE
YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE TRENDY AND ORIGINAL
WE'LL HAVE MORE MONEY IF WE KEEP IT SIMPLE
YEAH
SEEING AS IT'S QUITE A NEW TECHNOLOGY
UM
WE WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE'RE DESIGNING OUR UM MORE USER FRIENDLY REMOTE CONTROL
THAT A LOT OF INTERFACES CONSIST OF A CLUTTER OF BUTTONS THAT UM THAT THEIR FUNCTIONS COLOURS AND FORMS AREN'T ALWAYS HELPFUL
YEAH
YEAH
AND THAT ALL INTERFACES ARE DIFFERENT
SO UM THAT DOESN'T IMPROVE THE USE OF THE PRODU PRODUCT SO WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND
AND MAYBE LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES OF OTHER INTERFACES THAT CAN BE TOO COMPLICATED FOR PEOPLE TO USE
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
MM
BUT UM
YEAH
IN THE PHONE THAT I WAS THINKING OF AS WELL WHEN YOU CHANGE THE UM COVERS OF IT THE
THE LITTLE BUTTONS THAT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT CONTRO CONTROL STUFF ARE BEHIND THE RUBBER
SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE BUTTONS WHEN YOU'RE CHANGING THE FACES
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
'CAUSE IT'S JUST THE WEE CONTROL YEAH THING THAT'S BEHIND IT
SO
I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE ON ONE COLOUR
EACH FACE COULD HAVE ITS OWN COLOUR OF BUTTONS MAYBE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO THAT'S EVERYTHING THEN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OR BANANA SHAPED
YEAH
WHERE DO YOU HAVE TO SAVE IT TO
OKAY
JUST ESCAPE I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
HOPE SO
YEAH
YEAH
I DON YEAH
YEAH
IT'S FOR THE LIGHTING YEAH
YEAH
YEAH PLASTIC COAT
WE DECIDED ON THE COMPONENT
I I I'M SORRY I'VE LOST MY UM
POWERPOINT THING SO I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CA IT'S THE COMPONENT
THE COMMAND INTER
THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE YEAH
YEAH
UM
I THINK THAT IS WELL WE HAVEN'T REALLY MADE ANY DECISIONS ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT THE CLUSTER OF BUTTON FUNCTIONS COLOURS AND FORMS IN THE IN CONSISTENT USE
LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE IDEAS TO COMBAT THESE PROBLEMS
YOU KNOW HOW UM DIFFERENT INTERFACES ARE VERY DIFFERENT
AND CAN BE CONFUSING BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENCE AND BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT CLUSTERS OF BUTTONS THAT THEY HAVE
WE HAVEN'T REALLY DECIDED WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT
WELL IT'S JUST UM
W WHERE WHERE SHALL WE LOCATE THE BUTTONS
WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONS WI SHALL WE HAVE
SO PRETTY JUST JUST THE BASIC BUTTON FUNCTIONS
YEAH
YEAH EACH TELEVISION
YOU DON'T CHANGE THAT OFTEN YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT W IT WOULD SEEM SILLY IF WE'D HAVING ANYTHING ELSE JUST HAVE AN AUDIO BUTTON THOUGH
DO YOU KNOW
BUT WE
YEAH
THAT COULD BE A SALES PITCH
SIMPLE AND
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT I
WHAT I WAS THINKING WHAT DO YOUS THINK OF THIS
UM HAVING THE NUMBERS KIND OF LIKE NOT A BUNCH OF GRAPES BUT YOU KNOW LIKE PURPLE AND KIND OF IN A TRIANGLE
LIKE GRAPES
LIKE THAT'S KIND OF FRUITY OR SOMETHING
THAT'S JUST
YEAH
OKAY
YES
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
LIKE THE SKIN
YEAH
OKAY
SO THE ACTUAL REMOTE WOULD BE HARD PLASTIC AND THE CASINGS RUBBER
OKAY
AND THE BUTTONS OBVIOUSLY ARE RUBBER
OKAY
MM-HMM
I GUESS IT'S A BIT SCARY 'CAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE
SO IT SEEMS WE'D HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON IT
OR I DUNNO IF YOU COULD HAVE A BATTERY PACK
YEAH SO THERE'S THERE IS A ONE BATTERY BECAUSE MOST REMOTES USE TWO BATTERIES I BELIEVE
SO IF IT WAS RUNNING OFF OF ONE BATTERY AS A
RIGHT
ALTHOUGH IT NEEDS SOME LIGHT DOESN'T IT
SO IF WE'RE DOING YEAH
IF WE'RE
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S JUST SHOVED UNDER UNDER A CUSHION AND YEAH
YEAH
SO IT'S JUST DRAF GRAPHICAL FOR THE POINTING ASPECT
THE INFRARED IS LIKE THAT'S CONSIDERED A
OKAY
SO WHEN IT SAYS POINTING DEVICE THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
I THINK IF WE GO WITH THE UM DESIGN PLATE THING WE'LL HAVE TO
JUST BECAUSE OF COLOUR CLASHING AND IF WE WANTED TO SO AND
AND WE MIGHT I MEAN DEPENDING ON WHAT COMES OUT OF THE DESIGN WE MIGHT HAVE TO STICK TO JUST BLACK BUTTONS
YOU MEAN DIFFERENT COLOURS FOR THE LIGHTING OR
MM-HMM
OH I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
WELL Y
OH SO YOU'RE PICTURING THE LIGHT IS COMING FROM THE BACK
I KINDA PICTURED IT AS KIND OF COMING FROM THE SIDES AND LIGHTING IT UP FRONTWARDS
BUT BUT I GUESS YOU MEAN FROM THE BACK
OKAY
OKAY
RIGHT
MM-HMM
OH
YEAH
THEY THEY INSERT OVER
OKAY
T
OKAY IS THAT MY TURN THEN
ALRIGHT
I HAVE A SHORTER REPORT FOR YOU TODAY
UM IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET THIS UH
UH
OH
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT
OKAY SO UM THIS REPORT IS ABOUT UH TREND WATCHING
UM BASICALLY SO WE CAN LIVE UP TO OUR OUR UH PURPOSE OF HAVING A VERY FASHIONABLE REMOTE CONTROL
SORRY
THERE WE GO
UM SO JUST SO YOU KNOW MY METHOD WAS MAINLY WEB WEB BASED RESEARCH THIS TIME AROUND
I ALSO SPOKE WITH FASHION EXPERTS IN MILAN NEW YORK AND PARIS
AND I LOOKED AT THE DESIGN REPORTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS HERE AT REAL REMOTE
UM JUST SO C WE CAN WORK OFF OF THEM SEE HOW FASHIONS HAVE CHANGED
UM SO I'LL LIST THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS THAT I'VE COME ACROSS
UM AND THEY THEY'RE EACH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ONE THAT COMES AFTER IT
UH THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL
UM THIS SHOULD BE OUR PRIORITY AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING
THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT A REMOTE SH THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
SO I THINK WE'VE DONE A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT THAT JUST WITH LIGHTING AND THE BUTTONS AND THE
FACE PLATES
UM SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP ON TRACK WITH THAT
AND THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
SO PRETTY BASIC THERE
AND THE RECENT FASHION UPDATE UH ACCORDING TO FASHION WATCHERS IN PARIS AND MILAN
IS THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE
UM ALSO IN CONTRA UH IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY
AGAIN WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT WITH RUBBER VERSUS HARD PLASTIC BUTTONS
UM
SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES HERE
UM OF COURSE AS WE WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE PERSONAL FACE PLATES IN THIS MEETING AND I'D LIKE TO STICK TO THAT
THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLE THEMES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO WORK FOR US
IT SOUNDS SOMETHING THAT YOU'D USE ON KITCHENWARE
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANNA DO IT ON REMOTES
IT COULD BE ONE OF THE OPTIONS
MAYBE FOR THE TELEVISION THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR KITCHEN
UM THE TEMPORARY LIGHT UP IDEA SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GONNA STICK TO THAT
AND THEN UH TYING IN A TRENDY LOOK WITH USER FRIENDLINESS
MM-HMM
IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BUT IT IT'S EVERYWHERE
SO MAYBE WE I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PURSES WITH OLIVES ON THEM YOU KNOW
BUT I I THINK I THINK IF WE STICK TO T. V. BASED YOU KNOW MAYBE T. V. SHOWS OR
OR COLOUR SCHEMES
RIGHT
YEAH
THE
THE ESSENCE OF STRAWBERRY
YEAH
I GUESS YEAH
ONE THING I WAS THINKING THOUGH IS I DUNNO IF YOU ALL REMEMBER FROM OUR KICKOFF MEETING WE TALKED ABOUT OUR FAVOURITE ANIMALS
SO MAYBE THERE COULD BE ANIMAL BASED YOU KNOW
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A HOUSE CAT
OR OR A DOG
UM THAT MIGHT BE GETTING YOU KNOW TOO SPECIFIC AND WE SHOULD SEE WHAT THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST FACE PLATES ARE
BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND
AND DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD
OKAY
THERE YOU GO
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN SAVING YOUR POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS TO THE OKAY
THE POWERPOINT
SO
SO IF IT'S NOT WORKING THEY JUST HAVE TO SHAKE IT A BIT AND THAT REVITALISES IT
OKAY
MM-HMM
OH IS REGULAR NOT SIMPLE
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
THINK IT WAS CALLED COMMAND INTERFACE
COMMAND INTERFACE
MM-HMM
THAT WAS ON UM
ONE OF MY PRESENTATIONS
ABOUT HOW OFTEN IT WAS USED
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
I W
SHOULD I BRING IT UP
THE CH T
SCREEN SETTINGS WAS USED UM ZERO POINT FIVE TIMES AN HOUR
SO TW TWICE EVERY ONCE EVERY TWO HOURS
UM AND IT WAS CONSIDERED A ONE POINT FIVE RELEVANCE ON A SCALE OF TEN
THAT'S BRIGHTNESS COLOUR TONE ALL THAT
MM-HMM
THE OTHER ONE WAS AUDIO SETTINGS
MONO STEREO PITCH
I MEAN I SOMETIMES USE THAT
SOME T. V. S WILL HAVE THE OPTION OF LIKE LIVING ROOM STYLE MOVIE STYLE
UM AND THAT THEY SAY THAT'S USED ZERO POINT EIGHT TIMES AN HOUR WHICH IS ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT HIGH
LIKE ALMOST ONCE AN HOUR
UM RELEVANCE OF TWO
WELL THAT DIDN'T SOME UP ON MINE
OH
YEAH I GUESS THAT IT AFFECTS THE MARKETING 'CAUSE IT
MM IT IS A GOOD SALES PLOY TO SAY AREN'T YOU ANNOYED WITH REMOTE CONTROLS THAT HAVE ALL THESE BUTTONS
THIS ONE HAS CHANNEL VOLUME AND YOUR CHANNE AND YOUR POWER
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
NOW DO YOU GUYS NEED WANT AN IDEA OF HOW MANY UH ARE YOU GONNA COME UP WITH CASING IDEAS
LIKE F FIVE DIFFERENT
MM-HMM
YEAH YOU CAN HAVE SOME FUN WITH THE BUTTONS IT'S TRUE
YEAH
I GUESS WHAT YOU I IDEALLY YOU'D KIND OF THINK OF AGE MARKETS AS WELL
SO IT'S A SOMETHING THAT WILL YOU KNOW APPEAL TO THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS
SOMETHING THAT YOUR GRANNY WOULD WANT ON HER REMOTE CONTROL
UM AND INTERNATIONAL TASTES AS WELL SO
NOT EASY
OKAY
OKAY
HERE WE GO
ALRIGHT THE AGENDA FOR THI OH
ALRIGHT
UM THE AGENDA FOR THIS MEETING IS UM WE'LL INITIALLY HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION BY OUR TWO DESIGNERS
AND THEN WE WILL EVALUATE IT GIVEN THE CRITERIA THAT UM THAT WE GAVE
GAVE IT
AND UM TALK ABOUT OUR FINANCES WHETHER WE WERE UNDER OR OVER OUR BUDGET
I HAVE A UM A SPREADSHEET WHERE WE CAN CALCULATE UM OUR PRICES FOR EVERY ASPECT OF OF WHAT WE'VE MADE GIVEN OUR OPTIONS
AND UM EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AS A GROUP
AND UM
SO FIRST WE'LL HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
DO YOU NEED THE UM POWERPOINT FOR THIS
ALRIGHT
ON
A MANGO
OKAY
OH
OKAY
OOPS
YEAH
NOTICE YOU HAVE A NUMBER TEN BUTTON
OKAY
NO PROBLEM
AH
OH
YOU PRESS A PLUS BUTTON
OH OKAY
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT KIND BEFORE
YEAH
YEAH
OH
I
BUT
WOULD YOU HAVE TO GO ZERO PLUS ONE IF YOU WANTED TO GO TO CHANNEL ONE OR TWO
YEAH BUT I MEAN IF YOU PRESS IT'LL GO TO THAT CHANNEL RIGHT AWAY
'CAUSE YOU GOTTA PRESS THE PLUS AFTERWARDS
YEAH I KNOW BUT IF IF I WANNA GO TO SAY NUMBER LIKE SIXTY FIVE CHANNEL SIXTY FIVE
IF I PRESS THE SIX IT'LL GO TO CHANNEL SIX
AND THEN I'LL PRESS THE PLUS AND THEN IT'LL GO TO SIX AND THEN PUT THE FIVE AND IT'LL GO TO SIXTY FIVE
I TH
UM
YEAH IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING LIKE AS LONG AS WE REALISE THAT'S WHAT IT'LL DO
YEAH
C. AND V.
RIGHT WHERE UM WHERE'S THE POWER BUTTON
OH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
OH OKAY
YEAH
ERGONOMIC DEFINITELY ERGONOMIC
THE SPON YEAH
YEAH
BIT OF A STRESS BALL FEEL
YES
I WOULD
MY GOODNESS
THERE YOU GO
GENEVIEVE
YEAH
AND SOMETHING HMM
OH RIGHT
YEAH
IT LOOKS MORE
THINK LIKE VANILLA AND BANANA WOULD
OKAY YEAH
KINDA CHRISTMAS YOU KNOW
YEAH
COOL
ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
GOOD WORK EVERYONE
ALRIGHT
AND SO NOW THAT WE'VE WE HAVE A PROTOTYPE UH WE NEED TO GO OVER THE FINANCES AND SEEING IF THIS PROTOTYPE MATCHES UH WHAT OUR BUDGET CAN HANDLE
SO I HAVE
SOMETHING I'M GOING TO
OH WAIT A MINUTE
DO YOU NEED TO DO A PRESENTATION FIRST
YEAH
I'M GONNA CHECK THAT OUT FOR A SECOND
WHAT TIME IS IT ANYW
OH YEAH SORRY YOU'RE RIGHT
EVALUATION CRITERIA IS NEXT IN LINE
YEAH
JUST PRESS UM FUNCTION EIGHT AGAIN
AND THEN AGAIN I THINK
ONE MORE TIME
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OOH
YEAH
THE LOOK IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PLAYFUL
OH DEFINITELY DIFFERENT YEAH
OH YOU WERE ONLY GIVEN RED AND BLACK
OH OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S MANGO
IT'S MANGO
YEAH
I WOULD SAY TWO
PERSONALLY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I'D SAY MAYBE THREE
YEAH WE WANT IT SIMPLE
YEAH
I THINK SO
YEAH
YEAH
ONE
TH
THE PLUS NUMBER THING
YEAH COLOUR WILL DEFINITELY BE A FACTOR
I THINK THAT THE LOGO COULD BE SMALLER
AND MAYBE NOT SUCH A PROMINENT WAY
MAYBE LIKE AT THE BOTTOM KIND OF
OH IT JUST HAD TO BE ON THERE I GUESS
I LIKE THE APPEAL OF IT BEING LIKE A BIG GLOB IN YOUR HAND
MAYBE IF THE BOTTOM WAS JUST SORT OF FLAT AND THEN THE REST IS LIKE
ROUND
IT WOULD STILL BE COMFORTABLE I THINK
WE C WE COULD HANDLE IT I THINK
AH IT'D FALL OVER ALL THE TIME THOUGH
IT'D BE ANNOYING
'KAY WE'RE DONE DESIGNING
COME ON
I THINK IT WAS ANOTHER COLOUR AND IT WAS LIKE I THINK IT'D LOOK OKAY
I THINK MAYBE A TWO
SURE
YEAH
YEAH
DURABLE
BUT YOU'RE OUR MARKETING EXPERT
OH
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
YEAH
I WOULD GIVE IT A TWO STILL THOUGH
MM
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WE HAVE THE ALARM SYSTEM
I THOUGHT THE LIGHT FROM THE INSIDE WAS GONNA LIGHT UP
OR OR WAS IT GONNA MAKE A NOISE
YOU PRESS THE BUTTON IT MAKES A NOISE RIGHT
YEAH
AWESOME
AWESOME
I THOUGH W IT WAS GONNA MAKE A NOISE
OKAY
OH OKAY
WHOO
OKAY
YEAH TOTALLY
NO PROBLEM MM
TOTALLY
YEAH
YEAH SO IT'S JUST LIKE CHANNEL SIX SIX ENTER
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS ZEROS
AND THEN LIKE TWELVE ENTER
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK SO
IT'S LIKE RIGHT IN THE
YOUR THUMB MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT UH
YEAH
BUT IT IS SOFT
AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE UM
THE POWERPOINT SLIDE THING SAID WOULD BE GOOD FOR R. S. I. SO MAYBE IT IS BUT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YES WE DID
WELL YEAH THE COLOURS ARE YELLOW AND GREY
SO IT COULD BE GREY ON THE BANANA ONE
YEAH
MM YEAH
HUM
I WOULD SAY SO
BUT MAYBE MORE LIKE TWO 'CAUSE THERE'S NO LIKE PICTURES OF FRUIT IT'S JUST SORT OF NAMING IT BY A FRUIT
WITH THE WITH THE COLOURS
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S FASHIONABLE IN ITSELF TO HAVE INTERCHANGEABLE PLATES
BE LIKE
YEAH
MAYBE IF IT WAS SCENTED
YEAH WE HAVE MONEY FOR THAT
UM
ALRIGHT SO BASED ON THIS EVALUATION DO WE AVERAGE THEM OUT SORTA THING
OH
I WOULD SAY TWO
ONE POINT NINE OR SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW THESE THINGS
UM BETWEEN ONE AND TWO
ALRIGHT
YEAH
I'M ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW
YEAH IT IS ONE POINT NINE
OOH
GO HEATHER PAULS
YEAH
ALRIGHT NOW WITH THAT OVER AND DONE WITH OUR NEXT STEP IS TO SEE IF WE ARE UNDER BUDGET
AND UM MY COMPUTER'S FROZEN
AND NOW IT'S NOT
OKAY
SO
UM IN OUR SHARED FOLDER IF EVERYONE COULD GO THERE RIGHT NOW UM
I'M GOING TO UM STEAL A CABLE
UM IT'S IT'S UM
IT'S AN EXCEL FILE
OH
YEAH
'KAY THERE WE GO
UM PRODUCTION COSTS
AND UM I HAVE TO ACCESS THAT AS WELL
ONE MOMENT
'KAY SO FAR I'VE ADDED WHAT I THINK OR WHAT IS GOING ON
GREAT
IT'S BLINKING AT ME
IT'S LOCKED FOR EDITING
READ ONLY
I'M GONNA OPEN UP A SECOND ONE THEN 'CAUSE IT'S LOCKED FOR EDITING
I HAVE THE ORIGINAL IN MY UM
MY EMAIL ACCOUNT
I DUNNO
NO
NO I WAS HOPING THAT YOU GUYS COULD
UM THERE WE GO
OKAY HERE WE GO
SO WE NEED TO TALLY UP HOW MUCH OUR W OUR PRODUCT WILL BE COSTING
SO UM IF YOU CAN LOOK UP AT THE SCREEN
UM THE LARGE SCREEN OH I GUESS LOOKING AT YOUR OWN TOO AND TELLING ME WHICH ONE YOU THINK
OKAY WE'RE USING KINETIC WHICH IS QUITE A LARGE EXPENSE AT THREE EUROS
UM WE'RE USING A REGULAR CHIP
UM IT'S CUR IT'S DOUBLE CURVED SO ITS CURVED ALL AROUND
THAT'S ANOTHER THREE
WE'RE ALREADY AT FIVE
UM WE'RE USING PLASTIC AND RUBBER SO
GOOD THING PLASTIC IS FREE WE'RE AT EIGHT
UM
S
YEAH
I GUESS WE SHOULD DO IT JUST FOR ONE KIND
SO IT'S LIKE SPECIAL COLOUR WELL WE'LL HAVE TWO COLOURS RIGHT
WELL ONE COLOUR FOR THE CASE ONE COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS
SO WE CAN
UM WE HAVE PUSH BUTTON INTERFACE SO THAT'S INEXPENSIVE
AND UM WE HAVE A SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE BUTTON AND WE ALSO HAVE A SPECIAL FORM
AND A SPECIAL MATERIAL
WHICH PUTS US JUST BARELY UNDER BUDGET
HURRAY
YEAH
GOOD WORK GUYS
SO UM OUR OPERATING COST IS TWELVE TWENTY EUROS
AWESOME
AND BACK TO OUR POWERPOINT
SO WE'VE
'KAY
YES WE ARE
SO WE NEED TO DO A PRODUCT EVALUATION AGAIN WHICH IS PROBABLY UM
I DUNNO
A DIFFERENT EXTENSION OF A
HMM
YEAH 'CAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK
YEAH
ALRIGHT SO UM
DO YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE THERE WAS ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
PUSHED FOR CREATIVITY
YE OKAY
SO IT'D BE LIKE
NEED MORE TIME AND
MATERIALS
BUT YOU WERE ALLOWED M CREATIVITY
I THINK SO AS LIKE BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE CREATIV
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
GREAT
LEADERSHIP
IS THIS ME BEING LIKE GUYS DO YOU LIKE ME
UM
YEAH
YEAH
OOP OKAY
TEAMWORK
I THINK WE WORKED GREAT AS A TEAM
YEAH
ALRIGHT HOW WERE OUR MEANS
WE NEEDED MORE PLAY DOH COLOURS
YEAH
BUT EVER
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SATISFACTORY
IS THAT GOOD
YEAH
NEW IDEAS FOUND
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
EACH OTHER'S
MM
OKAY
WELL WITH THAT ACHIEVED OUR LAST SLIDE IS OUR CLOSING SLIDE
YES OUR COSTS ARE WITHIN BUDGET
IT'S EVALUATED GENERALLY POSITIVELY
AND UM DON'T FORGET TO COMPLETE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY
THEN WE CELEBRATE IN SUCH A WAY THAT I HAVE NO IDEA
ALRIGHT
OKAY BYE
OKAY
UM YEAH
I JUST GOT A FEW SLIDES SO SHOW THEM
THANK YOU
DO YOU WANT TO PRESENT IT
YEAH HERE WE ARE
MANGO SHAPE
THE L. E. D.
SO IT'S PALM HELD
YEAH
YOU JUST NEED THE NOUGHT
SO ONE PLUS ONE WOULD BE ELEVEN OR
YEAH BECAUSE IF YOU ON YOUR AVERAGE UM REMOTE IF YOU PRESS ONE TWICE YOU JUST GO TO UM OR UH SAY YOU WANTED CHANNEL TWELVE
YOU PRESS ONE AND THEN YOU GO TO CHANNEL ONE AND THEN TWO THEN YOU'D JUST GO TO CHANNEL TWO INSTEAD OF TWELVE
SO IF YOU DID LIKE ONE PLUS TWO YOU COULD GO TO CHANNEL TWELVE OR TWO PLUS TWO IS CHANNEL TWENTY TWO
OH
WELL I DON'T MIND WE CAN FURTHER DEFINE THAT
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT'D BE A PROBLEM THAT IT WENT TO CHANNEL SIX FIRST IN LIKE ON THE WAY TO CHANNEL SIXTY FIVE
BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S NOT AS SNAPPY
YEAH
YEAH
IF YOU DON'T PUT IT
YEAH
YEAH THAT YEAH
MM-HMM
UM
AND CHANNEL WHICH IS SO YOU COULD JUST GO LIKE THAT WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT LIKE
IT'S THE BIGGER R.
SO IT'S JUST LIKE
WE DECI
YEAH UM WE WENT FOR LIKE A A CIRCULAR DESIGN FOR THE NUMBERS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT'S KIND OF A MORE NATURAL MOVEMENT THAN JUST GOING LIKE THAT WITH YOUR THUMB
UH E ERGONOMICS ARE ALL CONSIDERED
YEAH
IT COULD CAUSE ANOTHER TYPE OF REPETITIVE STRESS INJURY THOUGH
BUT YEAH NO I MEAN IT'S A DIFFERENT MOVEMENT SO YEAH
UM AND THE FEEL OF IT I MEAN WE'VE MADE THIS OUT OF PLAY DOH
WHICH IS REPRESENTING THE YOU KNOW THE RUBBER AND THE SPONGY RUBBERNESS
UM 'CAUSE IT WAS SAID BEFORE IN THE MATERIAL SPECIFICATION THAT THIS THE THIS ANTI R. S. I. UM MATERIAL IS OFTEN USED IN STRESS BALLS SO THIS HAS GOT A YOU KNOW A BIT OF GIVE TO IT
AND IT JUST FEELS FEELS DIFFERENT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO FEEL IT YOURSELVES
HOW IT FITS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND
THANKS
AND YOU
O
OKAY AS FOR THE COLOURS WE WERE PRESENTED WITH UM A LIMITED RANGE OF COLOURS FOR THIS PROTOTYPE
BUT WE'RE THINKING THAT SEEING AS WE'RE HAVING IT IN INTERCHANGEABLE CASING ANYWAY
THAT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A REPRESENTATION OF THE TRUE COLOURS THAT WE WOULD NECESSARILY USE
OR THE COMBINATION
UM AND WE'RE THINKING TO CARRY ON WITH THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE THEME
THE COLOUR UM COMBINATION JUST COULD JUST BE NAMED AFTER DIFFERENT FRUIT LIKE BANANA COULD BE BLACK AND YELLOW
WATERMELON RED AND GREEN OR VANILLA MIGHT BE THE MOST POPULAR IF IT JUST UH BLENDS IN MORE SETTLED CREAM INSTEAD OF THE OTHERS ARE ALL A BIT GARISH
BANANA'S MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR COLOUR SCHEME LIKE THE COMPANY THE YELLOW AND BLACK
SO THAT FOR CORPORATE IDENTITY THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MOST STRENGTH
I MEAN WATERMELON YOU KNOW M PROBABLY APPEALING TO THE YEAH SEASONAL
APPLE GREEN BROWN MORE KINDA TRENDY YOU KNOW KHAKI
YEAH
OKAY
UM YEAH WE THOUGHT OF THE COMPONENTS IT WAS DEFINITELY UM A FOCUS OF ERGONOMICS AND JUST A SINGLE HA HANDHELD DEVICE
I MEAN YOU DON'T NEED TO USE BOTH HANDS ONE HAND TO HOLD THIS AND TYPE IN WITH THE OTHER YOU CAN JUST USE YOUR THUMB
UM AS WE SAID THE RUBBER'S PROBABLY USED FOR COMFORT AND ANTI R. S. I. AND THAT'S ABOUT IT
MM-HMM
MM GO
FEEL I THINK
WE'VE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE RUBBER COATING AND
YEAH
I THINK THE COLOUR HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT
I MEAN TH THE COLOURS WE WERE GIVEN FOR MAKING THE PROTOTYPE AREN'T THE COLOURS THAT I THINK WE WOULD'VE NECESSARILY CHOSEN
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF OOH UH AT ALL SLEEK RED BLACK AND YELLOW AND ORANGE
UM
BUT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IN LIKE A S JUST A MAYBE UH A KIND OF PALE METALLIC Y FINISH OR SOMETHING
WELL I KNOW KNOW IT'S FOR RUBBER
I MEAN DIFF IF YOU CAN VISUALISE THIS IN NICE COLOURS I THINK IT WOULD LOOK QUITE FANCY
OH WELL POTATO MANGO FRUIT AND VEG
POTATO'S FINE
POTATO'S FINE
YEAH
TOTALLY
IT'S REALLY ADAPTABLE
FOR THE
FANCY
I UH TWO THREE
YEAH AND THE USE OF THE RUBBER
FOR THE ANTI R. S. I.
THE L. E. D. USE ISN'T PARTICULARLY INNOVATIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY SCROLL BUTTONS IT'S ALL PUSHBUTTONS
THERE'S NO L. C. D. CONTROL SO IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE REST OF THE MARKET IT'S SORT OF PROBABLY HALFWAY
IN SOME ASPECTS IT IS LIKE WE SAID
YEAH
THOUGH IT WAS OUR SPECIFICATION
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND PERHAPS THE TURNING ON BUT
MM
AGAIN I THINK THE COLOUR COMES INTO THIS
OKAY
NOT IN
DON'T WORRY
I SUPPOSE I'VE GOT QUITE BIG HANDS
THING IS LIKE THAT IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE PARTICULARLY
YEAH
UH YEAH IT'S LESS UM WHAT'S TH HA
H IT'S GOT HIGHER CENTRE OF GRAVITY LIKE THAT
I WOULD DEFINITELY GO FOR THAT RATHER THAN LIKE YOUR AVERAGE PLAIN OLD REMOTE LIKE THAT BUT DEFINITELY IN ANOTHER COLOUR I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THOSE COLOURS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THE KINETIC ENERGY SHAKER STYLE Y WHOO OOH NO
BUT YOU KNOW THOSE'LL BE FIRMLY ON
MM YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
GOOD POINT
YEAH
YEAH
DOES THIS PROTOTYPE MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE AVERAGE USER
YEAH
BECAUSE YEAH BECAUSE THE MOST ACCESSIBLE BUTTONS ARE THE VOLUME AND THE AND THE CHANNEL CHANGING
AND IT'S JUST YOU WON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK DOWN TO FIND THEM
THEY'RE CLEARLY THERE EASY TO USE
SIMPLE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
IT
YEAH L LIGHTS ON AND OR FLASH AS WELL
BUT I MEAN IT'S NOT OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUS FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T S PARTICULARLY SEE AN ALARM
YEAH
BUT WHEN THE ALARM'S NOT YEAH
IF YOU
YEAH
YOU COULD S YEAH
WELL THE THING IS IF IT WAS HAD AN ALARM SYSTEM I MEAN
WHEN IT WHEN IT LIGHTS UP AS WE I MEAN IT COULD LIGHT UP WHEN THE ALARM WENT
BUT IF IT WAS HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE CUSHION OR SOMETHING THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY POINT
SO YOU CAN'T SEE THE ALARM BUT IT WOULD LIGHT UP
YEAH
ALARM BUT YOU CAN'T SEE AN ALARM INSIDE UH THE ALARM SYSTEM ITSELF
YEAH
YEAH
IT W YEAH
SORRY
YEAH
SORRY HEATHER
THAT WASN'T VERY CLEAR
YEAH I THINK JUST BECAUSE IT'S WE'VE DECIDED TO REDUCE IT DOWN TO THE BASIC BUTTONS I THINK THAT IN ITSELF MAKES IT SO MUCH EASIER TO USE
MM
AND OR SIXTY SIX ENTER Y
YEAH I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD
YEAH
GOOD
OOH
MM
OH
INJURY
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING
WE MAY HAVE TO DO SOME MORE RESEARCH INTO OTHER STRAIN INJURIES THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
I THINK WE'RE GETTING THAT'S TRUE
MM
I THINK YEAH I THINK TOO
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I THINK THIS IS THE
THE FACTOR THAT WE'VE BEEN LEAST SUCCESSFUL IN CONFRONTING
YEAH
FOUR I THINK
WELL I DON'T WHAT DO WHAT
OKAY
YEAH
LIKE UM THE COLOUR SCHEME NAMES AND STUFF
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT IS
THE THING IS I THINK IF SOMEBODY SAW THAT AND YOU SAID WHAT WAS THAT INSPIRED FROM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D INSTANTLY SAY MANGO
OH YEAH
THERE WE GO
THAT WOULD BE GREAT
UM
OKAY
IT'S
BETWEEN ONE AND TWO
SO THAT'S PRETTY FANTASTIC
MM
IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE MORE AROUND TWO
DO WE HAVE AN ONLINE CALCULATOR
OKAY
OH WOW
WELL DONE
WELL THAT'S EXCELLENT
PRODUCTION COSTS
IT SAYS IT
I THINK IT JUST MEANS THAT WE CAN'T ADD ANY MORE TO IT NOW
HAVE YOU HAVE YOU COMPLETED IT
OH RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
DOUBLE DOUBLE CURVED YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
OOF
CONGRATULATIONS GUYS
OF THE ACTUAL PROJECT RATHER THAN THE PRODUCT
A PROJECT
IS IS YEAH
SO WH HOW WE ACTUALLY WENT ROUND UH ABOUT DOING IT
I THINK WE WERE PUSHED
I MEAN WE WEREN'T REALLY GIVEN A LOT OF TIME OR MATERIALS YEAH TO GO ABOUT OUR DESIGN TASK
SO I THINK WE COULD'VE DONE WITH A BIT MORE TIME
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL WE WERE JUST LIMITED BY RESOURCES REALLY AND LIKE IF WE HAD DECIDED TO USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
AND LIKE SOLAR POWER BACKUP AND EVERYTHING THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD THAT
SO THAT DID LIMIT
CREATIVITY
JUST RESOURCES
BUT YEAH
THE FRUIT AND VEG IDEA
YEAH WE DID
WE'VE UH SEEING AS WE'VE COME OUT WITH WHAT WE INTENDED
A PRO UM A PRODUCT WITHIN THE BUDGET
I THINK THAT'S A SIGN OF GOOD LEADERSHIP AND ALSO OUR PERSONAL COACH HELPED US ALONG THE WAY SO YOU KNOW
I THINK IT'S BEEN FINE
YEAH
GOOD TIMING
AND PROJECT MANAGER OF COURSE
YEAH
YEAH
UM
YEAH AND MORE PLAY DOH 'CAUSE THAT WAS ALL THE RED WE HAD
SO EVEN IF WE WANTED TO MAKE A BIGGER PROTOTYPE WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
YEAH
IT COULD BE REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR THE COMPUTER
I THINK THE ONLY THING WAS HAVING TO REMEMBER TO YOU KNOW TO TICK THE OKAYS BUT I THINK I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO STRUGGLED WITH THAT
MM
UH ME TOO
YEAH
WELL I THINK WE'VE ALL LEARNT STUFF FROM EACH OTHER LIKE THE N UM YEAH
JUST ABOUT EACH DIFFERENT
GOT NEW IDEAS FROM EACH OTHER
YEAH
YEAH
SORRY
OH YEAH
WELL MM DID IT COME INTO THE INTO I DUNNO IF WE COUNTED THAT IN THE COSTS
YES
UH
FANTASTIC
OKAY BRILLIANT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
UM
THIS IS WHAT WE CAME UP WITH
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE DESIGN
IT'S UM BASED ON A MANGO
YEAH
AND WE
YEAH
AND WE HAVE THE COMPANY LOGO HERE AND THIS WILL BE THE
INFRARED HERE AND THIS'LL BE THE POWER POINT THE ON OFF BUTTON KIND YEAH
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE LITTLE R. S
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE POWER
AND UH WE JUST HAVE A SIMPLE DESIGN
WE WANTED IT ALL TO BE
ACCESSIBLE FROM YOUR THUMB YEAH PALM HELD AND ALL THE
BUTTONS ARE ACCESSIBLE FROM YOUR THUMB
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
OH THAT WAS A MISTAKE WASN'T IT
RIGHT NO THAT'S A ZERO
TAKE THAT ONE OFF
SORRY
I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE NUMBERS
AND THIS IS JUST IF YOU'VE GOT LIKE ELEVEN OR TWELVE OR
THIRT THE PLUS
YOU CAN GO ONE THREE OR SOMETHING
YOU PRESS THAT FIRST AND THEN YOU GO ONE THREE YEAH
WELL WE JUST THOUGHT WE HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS HERE SO WE WANTED SOMETHING REPRESENTATIVE OF NUMBERS LARGER THAN TEN AND
SO THE PLUS AND THEN YEAH
NO NO TH ALL THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALL THESE NUMBERS
THESE NUMBERS UM
THESE NUMBERS ALL WORK INDEPENDENTLY UP TO NINE
YEAH
OH NO
UH THE PLUS IS ONLY FOR IF YOU'RE GOING PAST THE NUMBER NINE
YOU P
OH
NO YOU PRESS THE PLUS FIRST
I I WELL IT DOESN'T WE HAVEN'T REALLY S I WOULD'VE THOUGHT YOU PRESSED THE PLUS FIRST AND THEN THE SIX FIVE
BUT SHE SAYS PLUS PRESS WHICH WHAT DO YOU THINK IS SIMPLER
IT'S A
YEAH
YEAH
OOPS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO
A CHANNEL
JUST SO WE CAN FLICK
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE LITTLE R. S
YEAH SO IT'S ALL ACCESSIBLE
WITHOUT M TAKING YOUR HAND OFF THE REMOTE
AND IT MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP WITH THE REPETITIVE STRESS INJURY AS WELL
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OF PLAY DOH YEAH
'CAUSE IT'D BE QUITE SUBTLE AND
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
THE POMEGRANATE'S KINDA GIRLY AND FUNKY KIND OF AND THEN THE VANILLA'S MORE FOR THE MORE SOPHISTICATED CUSTOMER WHO JUST WANTS SOMETHING THAT FITS IN WITH ALL DECOR
YEAH
MM
WELL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO NOT VERY SLEEK AND WE DON'T WANNA GO FOR BLACK BECAUSE MOST REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BLACK OR GREY
SO WE WANT IT TO BE STAND OUT THAT WAY ANYWAY
YEAH
A METALLIC Y FINISH WE WERE THINKING
POLISHED
OKAY
YEAH
WE WE WERE WE WERE THINKING ABOUT YEAH
I W I'D SAY TWO I THINK
FANCINESS
YEAH
YEAH
MM
I'LL GO FOR THREE AS WELL
NO
WOULDN'T BE SIMPLE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH VERY
I THINK ONE FOR THAT
YEAH
NO
YEAH THAT'S THE ONLY THING YEAH
IT'S DEFINITELY
YEAH
BUT THE
REMEMBER THE MANAGEMENT SAID THAT IT IT HAD TO BE PROMINENT
YEAH
YEAH
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE JUST THOUGHT OF THERE NOW
WHAT WHERE'S IT GONNA SIT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM
IS IT NOT GONNA FALL OFF THE ARM OF THE SOFA
YEAH
BUT THEN IT WOULDN'T SIT AS COMFORTABLY IN YOUR HAND
YEAH
OH THAT WOULD BE NICE
YEAH
THREE
YOU WOULD THOUGH 'CAUSE IT'S BIT IT'S MORE INTERESTING THAN OTHER REMOTES
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK WE HAVE TO MARKET IT IN THE RIGHT WAY THAT UM TO SAY THAT IT IS SIMPLISTIC
SO PEOPLE DON'T JUST SEE IT AND THINK UH THIS IS SO SIMPLISTIC I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE EUROS
WE HAVE TO MARKET IT
AND THE KINETIC ENERGY PART
YEAH
DON'T SHAKE
OH NO THE PLUS
YOU'RE USE THE ZERO
MAKE A NEW ONE
I THINK THEY'RE ABOUT TEN PO TEN POUND AREN'T THEY
ABOUT TEN POUNDS
FIFTEEN
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I THINK IT DOES VERY WELL
THE ZAP YEAH
UH
YEAH
YEAH THE BU WHEN YOU PRESS THE ALARM SYSTEM THE LIGHTS BEHIND THE AND IT'LL VIBRA
IT'LL BE AGAIN IN THE MARKETING
YEAH
THE LIGHT IT WILL
BUT
BUT BOTH
YEAH
OH THAT WOULD BE BRILLIANT
I'D BE TEMPTED TO
YEAH
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN THE MARKET
YEAH BUT YOU STILL COULDN'T SEE IT
IT WOULD JUST BE A LITTLE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OR SOMETHING
SO THE PLU THE PLUS W ONCE THAT'S WRITTEN DOWN ON THE PAGE THAT'LL BE REALLY SIMPLE WON'T IT
YEAH
THAT KIND OF ANNOYS ME THOUGH WHEN IT'S ZERO SIX WHEN YOU HAVE TO PRESS I DON'T KNOW WHY
OH OKAY
RIGHT
ALRIGHT AYE
YEAH
I'D SAY W YEAH ONE
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
BUT IF YOU'RE ZAPPING YEAH
I DON'T THINK IT WILL F
YEAH THE BIOLOGY
MM
YEAH
YEAH
I I'D SAY T TWO
YEAH
YEAH
N WE WE CAN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE ON THE BANANA THEME WE CAN'T HAVE IT AS BEING YELLOW
IT WON'T STAND OUT
SO N IT'S NOT ALWAYS GONNA BE THE SAME COLOUR
GRAY YEAH
YEAH COULD BE GREY
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT WE DIDN'T EVEN REA
YEAH
PERHAPS A METALLIC OR OR LIKE THAT'S GREY AND IT WOULDN'T BE THAT EXPENSIVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF METAL
NO
THAT ISN'T RUBBER
OKAY
FOLLOWING THAT BRIEFING WE DID
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK W YEAH I THINK ONE
WELL THAT WAS OUR BRIEF AND WE FOLLOWED THE BRIEF
WELL WE HAVEN'T GOT A BIG BANANA BUT
OH YEAH
NO
NO
OH THAT WOULD BE CLASS
YEAH
TWO
IT'S
YEAH
CLOSE TO TWO
YEAH
I GOT
YEAH 'CAUSE WE'VE A FOUR TO BRING DOWN
UH AYE
YEAH
UH SHOULD'VE ADDED FIVE
THIS IS
YAY
IS THAT THE PROJECT DOCUMENT
YEAH
OH RIGHT
WHAT ABOUT A SPECIAL COLOUR
ARE WE USING THAT
YEAH
AND A SPECIAL MATERIAL
YEAH
THAT'S GOOD
YEAH
THE MA
OR MATERIALS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
CREATIVITY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT C IT MIGHT'VE BEEN BIGGER
YEAH
I'M ACTUALLY NOT SURE IF I'VE SAVED MY PRESENTATIONS
YEAH
THROUGH DISCUSSION
YEAH
AND WE WERE A ABLE TO MODIFY EACH OTHER'S IDEAS
TO FIT IN WITH OUR AREAS OF EXPERTISE
IF IF IT IF IT
IF IT CAN BE AFFORDED
YEAH
YAY
YEAH
I'M SORRY
WHAT WAS THE WHERE'S THE L. E. D.
OH
OKAY
OH THERE'S NO E OKAY
OKAY
SIXTY
WELL THE THERE IS A THERE'S A DELAY ON REMOTES I THINK
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE IT IT'S LIKE A FIVE SECOND INPUT TIME
SO AS LONG AS YOU HIT THEM DADA
IT SHOULD BE FINE
AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT A BIG PAUSE BETWEEN THE T HITTING THE TWO BUTTONS
WAS THERE SO ON THE TOP THERE IS VOLUME AND
CHANNEL UP VOLUME UP
OKAY COOL
YEAH
IT'S THE R.
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES
OH IT'S NICE
OH I THINK I KILLED THE FIVE
I DID
I KILLED THE FOUR
OH GOD
OH IT SMELLS GOOD
BRAVO
YOU WANT THE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ORDER IT GOES IN
I HAVE ONE
EVALUATION CRI OKAY
THAT'S ME
HELLO
OH THERE WE GO
OKAY
COME ON MY COMPUTER
COME ON
SORRY MY COMPUTER'S GIVING ME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES
SHOULD I PRESS IT AGAIN
LAST TIME I DID THAT IT SH
OKAY
YOU'RE RIGHT
OH
STILL NOT THERE
OKAY NOW I THINK FOR THIS ONE I COULD WOULD YOU GUYS PREFER USE THE WHITEBOARD OR MAYB MAYBE I'LL JUST DO IT ON RIGHT ON THE SCREEN WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT
UM WE'RE GONNA BE DOING AN EVALUATION REPORT TOGETHER BASED ON THE PROTOPTYPE THAT WE'VE JUST SEEN
UM AND LOOKING LOOKING BACK AT MY NOTES FROM OUR BOTH OUR CONCEPTUAL AND OUR FUNCTIONAL MEETINGS
UM I MADE A LIST OF WHAT OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS AND GOALS WERE UM BACK TO OUR KICK OFF MEETING THIS MORNING
UM AND WE'LL EVALUATE AS TO WHETHER WE'VE S DONE WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO
UM AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT ON A ONE TO SEVEN SCALE WHERE ONE IS TRUE AND SEVEN IS FALSE
SO BASICALLY THE LOWER P THE LOWER THE POINTS THE BETTER
OKAY SO QUESTION NUMBER ONE
DOES THE REMOTE WHOOPS
SORRY
OH I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE UM I'LL DO IT ON THE WHITEBOARD
I CAN'T CHANGE IT SO I'M G I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO PUSH IT DOWN ONCE
I'LL WRITE DOWN OUR SCORES UP ON THE
OKAY SO NUMBER ONE
DO WE HAVE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
YEAH I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR DEFINITION OF FANCY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT
IT'S NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
I KINDA I LIKE THE POTATO LOOK
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT
IT'S WHAT
OH SORRY THE MANGO THE MANGO LOOK
YEAH IT IS FRUIT OR VEGETABLE DEPENDS ON YOUR MOOD
SO I MYSELF WOULD SAY A ONE OR A TWO
IT'S A TWO
OKAY AND P
ONE BEING TRUE
SO
TWO
OKAY ACTU THAT'S PRO THAT'S GONNA GET CONFUSING LIKE THAT
OKAY SO QUESTION NUMBER TWO WAS IS IT TECHN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
SO I KNOW WE HAVE THE KINETIC ENERGY WHICH IS VERY INNOVATIVE
USE OF THE RUBBER THE USE OF THE L. E. D.
ISN'T
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND I THINK I MEAN IT IT'S TOUGH TO SAY BECAUSE WE WERE WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE ANY MORE INNOVATIVE THAN THIS
BECAUSE THEN THAT WOULD'VE DEFEATED THE PURPOSE
SO I MEAN I WE'LL PUT THREE BUT I THINK WE ACTUALLY REACHED OUR GOAL
WE DIDN'T WANT IT ANY MORE THAN THAT
OKAY QUESTION NUMBER THREE
UH WILL IT BE EASY TO USE
YEAH
YEAH
S
YEAH I THINK IT'S YOU CAN'T REALLY GET CONFUSED WITH THAT
I MEAN THERE'LL BE S WE HAVE TO WORK OUT THE UH NUMBER THE PLUS SYSTEM
BUT ONCE THAT'S FIGURED OUT IT SHOULD BE FINE
NUMBER FOUR
IS THIS A GOOD LOOKING REMOTE
REMEMBER THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
MM-HMM
WHOOPS
SHOULD JUST NOT TOUCH IT
THIS TIME IT'S THE THREE I KILLED
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF IT SHOULD BE LIKE FLATTER
OR
WELL
YEAH THE BOTTOM COULD BE LIKE CH CHOPPED A BIT
OH
THAT'S TRUE
MAYBE IT COULD IT COULD BE ON THE BOTTOM SO YOU WOULDN'T LOO LIKE IF IT'S FLAT HERE SO IT SITS UP
LIKE THAT
I G
IF IT'S WEIGHTED MAYBE
DETAILS DETAILS
OKAY
SO IS THIS A GOOD LOOKING REMOTE
WOULD WE WANNA SHOW IT OFF TO OUR FRIENDS
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN I GUE YEAH IT'S PERSONAL TASTE BUT
YEAH
OKAY SO SHOULD WE SAY TWO FOR THAT
YEAH
OKAY
UH QUESTION NUMBER FIVE
WHAT'S UM WILL PEOPLE BE WILLING TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE EUROS ON THIS PRODUCT
REMEMBER THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WERE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL LOOKED FANCY
MM-HMM
YEAH IT THE MARKETING WILL HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH IT
SHAKE IT AND THE BUTTONS FALL OFF
NO I GUESS I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROL INDUSTRY HOW MUCH YOUR AVERAGE SELLS FOR BUT I KNOW I AM AREN'T I
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY BATTERIES
SO IN THE LONG TERM THIS CAN ACTUALLY SAVE YOU MONEY
SO WE'LL MARKET IT THAT WAY TOO
SO YEAH I THINK WITH A GOOD MARKETING SCHEME UM AND THE PERSONALISATION OPTIONS IT'LL
YEAH
OKAY NUMBER SIX
CAN SOMEONE READ IT OUT
OR
UM YEAH
SO THAT WAS MAINLY THAT THE STATISTICS WE SAID
MM-HMM
YEAH I GUESS THE I THINK THE KEY WORD THERE IS AVERAGE 'CAUSE THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THAT USED THE UH VIDEO INPUT AND SOUND AND STUFF
BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU AND I REALLY
SO
OKAY SO ONE
OKAY
NUMBER SEVEN
C HEATHER COULD YOU PUSH IT DOWN
WILL THIS REMOTE CONTROL BE EASY TO FIND WHEN LOST
REMEMBER THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS LOSE THEIR REMOTE REGULARLY
NOW IS THERE THE IS THE ALARM SYSTEM STILL WAS IT IMPLEMENTED
IT TURNS INTO A DUCK AND STARTS QUACKING
HERE I AM
UM
OKAY
WE OH YOU'RE JUST EXPLAINING WHY IT'S NOT ON THE PROTOTYPE
BUT YEAH IT'LL BE THERE
SO WE CAN WE COULD SAY THAT
WE CAN GIVE IT A ONE BECAUSE COMPARED TO EVERY OTHER REMOTE EVER M EVER MADE THIS ONE WILL BE EASIER TO FIND
OKAY
UM
QUESTION NUMBER EIGHT
WILL IT BE EASY TO LEARN HOW TO USE THIS REMOTE WHEN BRAND NEW
REMEMBER THAT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF USERS USUALLY FOUND IT DIFFICULT
SO IT HAS TO BE YEAH IT'S EAS THEY'LL PICK IT UP AND THEY'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO
THE PLUS THING NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON
YEAH
WELL
DO
DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE FOR THE MIDDLE ONE TO BE AN JUST AN ENTER BUTTON
SO THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUSH TWO BUTTONS EVERY TIME AT LEAST
YOU COULD JUST PRESS SIX ENTER OR ONE TWO ENTER
YEAH
UM OKAY SO WE CAN WE'LL SAY YES IT'S UH ONE
OKAY
QUESTION NUMBER NINE
UH WILL IT MINIMISE THE EFFECTS OF R. S. I. WHICH WAS REPEATED STRAIN INJURY
UM WHICH AFFECTED OVER A QUARTER OF USERS
S
IT'S SOFT AND
AND PEOPLE COULD
MM-HMM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER OPTIONS THERE ARE
COULD I MEAN YOU COULD HOLD IT IN YOUR LEFT HAND AND D USE YOUR INDEX FINGER
BUT THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY OTHER OPTIONS UNLESS IT'S LIKE A KEYBOARD
SO I THINK WE DID AS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WITH A REMOTE CONTROL
SO ONE OR TWO DO YOU THINK
TWO OKAY
OKAY NUMBER TEN
DID WE SOMEHOW INCORPORATE THE COMPANY COLOUR AND LOGO
NOW IS THE COLOUR GONNA BE THERE EVEN IF IT'S LIKE VANILLA
IS THE YELLOW
MM-HMM
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE COLOUR'S SOMETHING THAT WE
BUT I MEAN THE YELL YEAH D YELLOW'S UGLY THOUGH DEPENDING ON THE
SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO TALK TO OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGERS AND SEE IF WE CAN GET AWAY WITH JUST THE R. R.
OKAY
YEAH
AND THE BUTTONS IN THE MIDDLE
OKAY
SO DO YOU THINK THAT'S MORE OF A THREE THEN
THREE FOUR
FOUR
WELL WE HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR IT SO WE BUT WE CAN STILL PUT A
A FOUR
OKAY AND FINAL QUESTION
UM DID WE STAY TRUE TO OUR MOTTO AND PUT THE FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS
CURRENT TRENDS OF FRUITS AND VEGGIES DESIRE FOR SPONGINESS
YEAH
NO UH ARE THE PLATES INTERCHANGEABLE
I THINK I MISSED A FEW THEY ARE
SO YOU CAN HAVE BANANA AND KIWI AND OKAY
OKAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF IN THE MAKING TOO LIKE MAYBE IT'LL BECOME MORE
MM-HMM
YES WE DO
SO I WH WHAT WAS I GONNA PUT FOR THAT
A TWO FOR FASHION
OKAY SO OUR AVERAGE THERE FIVE SIX EIGHT TEN ELEVEN
TWELVE THIRTEEN FIFTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE DIVIDED BY ELEVEN
IS
BETWEEN OKAY
UM
YEAH THAT'S VERY GOOD 'CAUSE THE HIGHEST WE COULDA GOT IS ONE
DOES THAT SEEM RIGHT THEN
OKAY
SORRY
ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT
OKAY
OH IS IT LOCKED 'CAUSE I'M IN IT
OR OKAY
MM
'S GOOD
MM-HMM
YEAH AND THE CONCEPTUAL AND FUNCTIONAL
LIKE WE WERE VERY CREATIVE IN IN COMING UP WITH AN IDEA I GUESS BUT M
WHEN WE CAN DOWN TO IT
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
GOOD LEADERSHIP I THINK WE STAYED ON TASK
MM-HMM
AND THE TIMING WAS GOOD
WE NEVER WERE PUSHED FOR TIME OR SAT AROUND DOING NOTHING SO
WAS GOOD TEAMWORK
I THINK WE ARE WELL SUITED TO OUR ROLES
OH REALLY
OKAY
YEAH
THE COMPUTER PROGRAMMES ARE GOOD
THE
YEAH
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING
YEAH
THEY'LL PROBABLY STILL BE THERE
UM
I'M NOT SURE NEW IDEAS FOUND
YEAH WELL I GUESS WE REALLY IT WE BOUNCED OFF OF EACH OTHER WHICH WAS COOL
LIKE BASED ON MARKETING STUFF AND THEN YOU'D SAY SOMETHING ABOUT INTERFACE AND YEAH WORKED WELL
MM-HMM
OH DOES IT HAVE SMART MATERIALS BY THE WAY
DOES IT HAVE SMART MATERIALS
OH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BY WATCHING T. V.
MM
CONCLUSION
DADADA
OKAY
OH THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK
OH ALRIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
UM ALRIGHT
I'LL JUST PUT THAT THERE
UH AS YOU ALL KNOW WE'RE HERE TO CREATE A BRAND NEW FANTASTIC REMOTE
UH I'M NICK DEBUSK I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER
UH WE'LL JUST GET STARTED WITH EVERYONE KIND OF LETTING EACH OTHER KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR ROLE IS UM
GO AHEAD
'KAY
OKAY
UM SO WE'VE GOT OUR OPENING OUR OUR AGENDA IS THE OPENING UH ACQUAINTANCE WHICH WE'VE KINDA DONE
UH TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND THEN CLOSING
UH GRAND TOTAL OF TWENTY FIVE MINUTES WE HAVE HERE
UM SO WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UM WE WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING ORIGINAL
UM OF COURSE WE'RE A NOT ONLY A ELECTRONICS COMPANY BUT A
FASHION UM CONSCIOUS ELECTRONICS COMPANY SO WE WANT IT TO BE TRENDY UM AND WE WANT IT TO BE EASY TO USE
UM
WE'VE GOT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAILED DESIGN UM WHICH BASICALLY IS IS THE THREE OF YOU UM
AND
W UH WELL UM FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UM
UM DO WE HAVE UM
ANY IDEAS OF OF MAYBE D LET'S JUST THROW OUT SOME IDEAS OF WHAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL WE WANT TO HAVE
AND THEN WE CAN GO INTO HOW WE'RE GONNA DESIGN IT AND
AND HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THE DETAILING ON IT
SO WE WANT IT TO BE UM A T. V. REMOTE OR I I MEAN DO WE WANT IT TO TO DO OTHER THINGS BESIDES JUST BE A A TELEVISION REMOTE
'KAY
MM-HMM
'KAY
I I THINK YEAH YEAH R UNIVERSAL REMOTE
UM THIS IS MY FIRST UH GO ROUND WITH CREATING A REMOTE CONTROL SO I THINK WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT HERE
UM
OKAY
SO WE SHOULD WE SHOULD SET OUR REMOTE CONTROL UP TO WHERE IT HAS A UH
LIKE A TRACKING DEVICE OR OR LIKE A A
IT MAKES A NOISE THERE'S A BUTTON ON THE T. V. THAT YOU PRESS AND
'KAY
YEAH
DO WE WANT SO THEY'RE KINDA LIKE LONG AND RECTANGULAR
DO WE WANT SOMETHING CRAZY
YOU KNOW WE WANT SOMETHING NEW THAT'S GONNA STAND OUT
A M A MODERN SO OUR REMOTE SHOULD BE
'KAY
UM
OKAY SO YEAH SO WE WANT IT TO BE STURDY WE WANT IT TO TO HOLD UP TO SOMEBODY'S CHILD YOU KNOW
THROWING IT ACROSS THE ROOM OR AS YOU SAID PEOPLE KINDA THROW IT
SO BALL SHAPED UH YOU KNOW IF IT WERE BALL SHAPED MAYBE THEN IT
'KAY
UM SO WE WANT IT TO BE MODERN FUN STURDY
UM
SO OUR FORM AND OUR FUNCTION
UM WE WANT IT TO BE UM
EASY TO FIND
UM
WHAT ELSE
IT WHAT ELSE DO WE WANT IT TO TO DO
SO WE WANT IT TO BE UNIVERSAL
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SELL FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS UM
AND
YOU KNOW GOALS FOR PROFITS ARE I THINK SOMEWHERE AROUND UH FIFTY MILLION EUROS WHAT THEY WANNA MAKE ON IT SO
'KAY
SO MARKETING YOU KNOW HOW MAYBE UH
MARKETING YOU COULD S FIND OUT WHAT IS THE MOST UNIVERSALLY UM APPEALING REMOTE CONTROL OUT THERE
'KAY
UM
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEAS FOR WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE
MAYBE WE COULD DRAW IT UP ON THE ON THE BOARD OVER THERE
SOME IDEAS
WE WANT IT TO BE A B A BALL YOU KNOW WE'LL DRAW UP WE'LL DRAW UP THE BALL AND MAYBE TH UM WHERE THE BUTTONS ARE LOCATED
UH-HUH
HOW WOULD WE GO ABOUT UM
MAKING YOU KNOW GETTING RID OF OUR WEAK POINTS
WHAT I MEAN WOULD WE JUST HAVE A FLAT SPOT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BALL
NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT
WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR TITLE WAS AGAIN
YOU'RE THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
OKAY
YEAH
IT'S NOT NEW IT'S NOT INNOVATIVE IT'S YOU KNOW EVERYBODY DOES LONG REMOTE BECAUSE IT'S EASY IT'S IT'S STABLE UM
SO IF NO GO AHEAD
SOMETHING WITH A GRIP
YEAH
BECAUSE EVEN I SUPPOSE EVEN WITH THE BALL
IT'S IT MIGHT NOT BE THE EASIEST TO HOLD ONTO UM
SO PERHAPS THE THE JOYSTICK THE THE KEYBOARD IDEA MIGHT WORK BETTER
BUT THEN AGAIN PEOPLE LIKE TO USE ONE HAND TO FLIP AND ONE HAND TO HOLD THEIR SODA SO MAYBE MAYBE WE
I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST SHOOTING EVERYTHING DOWN HERE
UH UM
YEAH
OKAY SO UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES HERE TO COME UP WITH OUR UM REMOTE CONTROL IDEA AND START ROLLING WITH IT
UM WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROL AND UM WE'VE GOT A COUPLE IDEAS UM
LET'S SEE HERE
WHAT IF WE HAD WHAT IF WE HAD NOT ONLY UM SAY WE WENT WITH THE BALL THE BALL FUNCTION UM
BUT MAYBE WE GIVE IT SORT OF GRIPS ALONG THE SIDE S UM TO MAKE IT EASIER TO HOLD ON TO
SO
YOU KNOW UM S SO IT'S EASIER TO HOLD ONTO THAT WAY
COURSE THAT'LL THEN REMOVE SOME OF OUR OUR BALL
UNLESS THIS UNLESS THIS PART WERE RAISED SO SAY THE COVER FLIPS OVER AND COVERS THAT PART
SO THE GRIP IS
NO THAT WOULDN'T WORK EITHER UM
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT FLAT ON THE BOTTOM THEN THAT ELIMINATES OUR BALL ANYWAYS
SO IF IT WERE FLAT ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN HAD THE
SORTA GRIPS ON THE SIDE HERE I GUESS
UM
AND THEN
FLAT UH
AND THEN WE HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE HINGE
SO IF WE'RE FLAT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GONNA ROLL AWAY IT'LL STAY WHERE WE WANT
MM THAT'S TRUE
SO WE DON'T HAVE IT FLIP OPEN
WE JUST HAVE A BALL
OKAY SO THEN WE FORGET THE BALL
IT LOOKS COOL BUT IT'S REALLY NOT IT'S NOT FUNCTIONAL UM
SO WE'VE GOT OUR SORT OF KEYBOARD KIND
WHAT IF WE FLIPPED IT AROUND HERE SO THAT IT WERE UM
SORRY THAT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE WHAT YOU HAD THERE
UM SO IT'S UP AND DOWN YOU HOLD IT THIS WAY
COURSE THEN IT'S IT'S LIKE THE RECTANGULAR AGAIN ONLY WITH A COUPLE OF JUTTING OUT POINTS
BUT IT'S ONE HANDED UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A CORD LIKE JOYSTICKS DO
IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE IT TO WHERE IT WOULD WORK WITH A LIKE A SENSOR ON EITHER SIDE
SO THAT EITHER WAY YOU'RE POINTING IT IT WOULD WORK
MORE EXPENSIVE AND YEAH
'KAY
UM
TRUE
'KAY
ARE WE OUT OF TIME
OKAY WELL JUST TO FINISH UP SHOULD WE S GO WITH THIS PLAN START MAKING SOME
ARE GOOD IDEAS WHAT ARE NOT
UH
MUST FINISH NOW SO
AND THEN MARKETING WILL LOOK AND SEE WHAT UH WHAT PEOPLE WANT
OKAY
AND PROJECT MANAGER WILL DESIGN A BETTER MEETING FOR NEXT TIME AROUND BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PREPARED
AND UH ALRIGHT GOOD MEETING
RIGHT
I'M MANUEL AND I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER IN IN THIS PROJECT UM
IN THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN PHASE I'M I'LL BE DEALING MOSTLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS
UM WE'LL DISCUSS WHAT THE PROG WHAT FUNCTIONS THE THE PRODUCT HAS TO FULFIL AND SO AND SO ON
UM I SUPPOSE WE'LL WORK PRETTY MUCH TOGETHER ON THAT ONE
UM UM IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN UM I'LL BE PRO MOSTLY DEALING WITH PROPERTIES AND MATERIALS UM OF OUR PRODUCT
AND UH THE DETAILED DESIGN IN THE DETAILED DESIGN I'LL BE CONCERNED WITH THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF
UM SO WE'RE PRETTY MUCH WORKING TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY ON THE DESIGN FRONT HERE
OKAY
MM
MM MM
RIGHT
SO
MM
WELL THERE ARE OF COURSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BE ANY FORM AND FULFIL ALL FUNCTIONS AT THE SAME TIME
SO THERE ARE ALWAYS THE SOME RESTRICTIONS WE HAVE TO APPLY HERE
UM HOWEVER UM ONE QUESTION IS HOW STABLE IS THAT THING SUPPOSED TO BE THAT REFERS TO THE MATERIAL PRETTY MUCH UM
WHAT ARE WE GONNA BUILD THAT THING OUT OF
HOW STURDY IS IT GONNA BE
DO WE WANT IT TO LAST LONGER OR RATHER HAVE PEOPLE
WHATEVER HAVE TO BUY ONE EVERY HALF A YEAR
RIGHT
RIGHT
ONE PROBLEM YOU'D GET WITH THIS DESIGN IS UM THE BALL IS A NICE IDEA BECAUSE OF IT'S STABILITY REALLY BUT OF COURSE
SINCE IT'S A BALL IT'LL ROLL SO WE'D HAVE TO HAVE IT FLAT ON ONE SIDE AT LEAST DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE TAKE AWAY THAT PART
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES
ALSO ALSO YOU RISK THE HINGES HERE
THAT'S THAT'S UM A PROBLEM
THAT'S THAT'S INTERESTING OF COURSE BUT THAT'S OF COURSE A WEAK POINT YEAH
E NO NO UH UH
N N
UH I'M YOUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SO I B WELL THE POINT IS
THAT
WELL MAYBE I DUNNO
THE SHAPE IS PERHAPS NOT THE MOST IDEAL
AS AS STABLE AS IT IS THERE MUST BE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN UM STABILITY AND DESIGN HERE SO
MM
MM
WELL WITH THE ONE HANDED DESIGN YOU ALSO HAVE THE THE PROBLEM OF THE SIZE W 'CAUSE YOU KNOW FROM CELL PHONES THEY CAN BE TOO SMALL
SO IF THE REMOTE IS TOO SMALL IT IF IT'S SMALL IT PROBABLY LOOKS BETTER BUT
MAY NOT BE TH AS FUNCTIONAL
SO FOR THAT THERE'S
SO
THE QUESTION IS ALSO I DUNNO D DO YOU REALLY ALWAYS WANT TO OPEN THAT THING WHEN YOU HAVE TO USE IT
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO LIE AROUND OPENED ALL THE TIME ANYWAY SO I DON'T KNOW IF A LID IS A GOOD IDEA
FROM STABIL STABILITY POINT OF VIEW UH IT CERTAINLY IS
BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO FACE IT AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MORE OF THESE THINGS BREAK BY ACCIDENT UH THE MORE WE SELL
SO IT'S DON'T MAKE IT TOO STABLE UH
TO THE OTHER DESIGN
IT LOOKS COOL
UH FUNCTIONAL
RIGHT
RIGHT
QUESTION IS WHAT MAKES THOSE GAME PADS FUNCTIONAL
W I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE FORM FOR FULL HAND
SO IT'S A ROUND SHAPE UNDERNEATH THAT MAKES IT COMFY RIGHT MAKES IT NICE SO THAT'S THE ESSENTIAL PART
EXCEPT FOR THAT I THINK WE'LL NOT PROBABLY NOT GET A GET AWAY FROM SOME LONGER DESIGN
'CAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE TO KNOW WHICH WAY AROUND TO POINT THIS THING
YOU KNOW ALL THAT DIF BATTERIES RIGHT AND
BATTERIES GO WEAK AS WELL SO UM AFTER A WHILE YOU HAVE TO POINT IT TOWARDS THE UH
TOWARDS THE EQUIPMENT YOU WANNA CONTROL WITH IT RIGHT
SO HAVE TO M
SHOW WHICH IS THE FRONT WHICH IS THE BACK
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD DO THAT
O OF COURSE THE MORE TECHNOLOGY YOU STICK IN THAT THE MORE IT'LL COST SO
COURSE YOU CAN DO THAT
I MEAN OF COURSE IT'LL BE EVIDENT AFTER A WHILE OR IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'LL IT'LL BE EVIDENT WHICH WAY AROUND TO POINT IT
SINCE YOU HAVE THE THE NUMBERS AND THE AND THE THE BUTTONS AND STUFF
BUT UM IT'S RATHER ABOUT AN INSTINCTUAL THING
LIKE YOU JUST GRAB IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO S LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW WHICH WAY AROUND TO POINT IT
OTHERWISE THE DESIGN OF OR THE THE POINT OF PUTTING TWO SENSORS ON BOTH SIDES UM WOULD PROBABLY WORK
MM
LET'S
OBVIOUSLY
ALRIGHT
HIYA I'M RYAN
UM I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
UM LIKEWISE I'VE THREE DIFFERENT ROLES FOR EACH STAGE OF DESIGN
UM THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IS LOOKING AT THE TEX TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF A REMOTE CONTROL
UM IN THE CONCEPT DESIGN THE USER INTERFACE HOW THE USER REACTS WITH THE THE PRODUCT
AND THE DETAILED DESIGN UM SORT OF LIKE THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
WHAT THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR UH THINGS LIKE FASHIONS WHAT MAKES WHA HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT SPECIAL
THAT'S ABOUT IT
YEAH
YEAH
WELL UH S FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS JUST JUST YOU KNOW CHANGE CHANNELS IS ITS MAIN FUNCTION
OH RIGHT
I SUPPOSE YOU C TRY MAKE IT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE FOR COULD WORK ON ALL SORT OF ELECTRICAL
PRODUCTS IN IN ONE PERSON'S HOUSE
BUT YOU KNOW THEY ALL SORTA HAVE THE SAME ROLE CHANGING CHANNELS VOLUMES AND THEN PROGRAMMING
I THINK THEY ALL WORK ON THE SAME PRIN PRINCIPLE AS WELL SORTA LIKE I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW
BUT IS IT JUST INFRA RED
IS THAT STANDARD
YE YEAH
UM ONE THING I THOUGHT OF WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS YOU ALWAYS LOSE 'EM
SO IF THERE'S A G A WAY OF FINDING IT QUITE EASILY I THOUGHT THAT'D BE QUITE GOOD QUITE A GOOD FEATURE
OH YOU CAN GET THOSE KEY WELL YOU COULD WHISTLE OR MAKE A NOISE AND IT'D BEEP
YEAH
GENERALLY ALL REMOTES ARE SORT OF QUITE SIMILAR IN THEIR APPEARANCE
JUST LONG
YEAH
BLACK USUALLY
YEAH
I THINK SO
MAYBE SORTA SPHERICAL OR SOMETHING
A BALL
YEAH
PEOPLE I THOUGHT MAYBE
BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS TEND TO THROW A REMOTE CONTROL ABOUT THE PLACE TO ONE ANOTHER IF IT WAS IN A BALL
AND MAYBE THE ACTUAL CONTROLS ARE INSIDE OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT COULD BE CASED ON THE OUTSIDE AND T EVERYTHING COULD BE INSIDE
YE
SMALL
I'D I COULD DRAW SORTA THE BALL IDEA
MY ORIGINAL IDEA WAS JUST SIMPLY
SORT OF A SPHERE WHERE MAYBE YOU
THIS IS WHERE IT'S CONNECTED TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN YOU OPEN IT OUT IT COULD FOL IT COULD BE MAYBE FLIP
LIKE A FLIP PHONE AND THEN WHEN YOU FOLD IT OUT THE MIDDLE
MAYBE A HINGE THAT'LL HAVE TO BE THE STRONGEST PART OF IT
IF THAT IF WE DID USE A HINGE OR IF IT WAS JUST TWO PARTS AND THEN YOU'D HAVE
JUST SORTA YOU YOU YOU KNOW YOUR BUTTONS
THING IS INSIDE I THINK SOMETIMES REMOTES HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS SO MAYBE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE UM AS FEW BUTTONS INSIDE AS POSSIBLE
UM I DUNNO WHAT'S THE IDEA FOR
JUST SOMETHING MAYBE IF YOU HA IF IT HAD LIKE IF SOME KIND OF
LIKE LIGHT OR SOMETHING OR LIGHTS AROUND IT
IT'S LOOKING A BIT LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF STAR WARS AT THE MOMENT THOUGH TO BE FAIR
BUT YEAH
THAT WAS THAT WAS A SORTA SIMPLE IDEA I HAD AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU COULD ABOUT
RIGHT IT WOULD ALMOST BE LIKE A BALL
SO THAT WAS JUST JUST AN IDEA I HAD
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANYBODY ELSE HAS OTHER IDEAS
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE F YEAH
YEAH THAT'S G THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
THE IDEA IT DIDN'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY BE F A HINGE THAT WAS JUST ONE IDEA THOUGH
YEAH
WELL I I SUPPOSE THAT THINGS BECOME DESIGN
BUT I MEAN I
I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF LIKE THE DESIGN OF OTHERS
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN A LONG RECTANGLE FOR REMOTE MAYBE SMALL SORT OF FATTER ONES
BUT THERE'S NOTHING BEING DONE SORT OF OUT OF LEFT FIELD YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK DEFINITELY DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT
IS A GOOD IDEA
I MEAN MAYBE DESIGN SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF LIKE UH I SUPPOSE NOT EVERYBODY'S EVERYBODY'S HAND'S THE SAME BUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAYBE FIT IN THE HAND EASIER
YEAH WITH A GRIP
IT STILL MIGHT BE HARD TO IT STILL NOT THE HO EASIEST THING TO HOLD YEAH
LIKE YEAH
YEAH
IT'S D YEAH
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY GOT TO BE A A ONE HANDED A ONE HANDED JOB
YEAH
BUT THEN MAYBE TO GO BACK TO THE TO TH S SOMETHING ALONG THOSE THINGS THEN
YEAH
PUT IT
EVEN IF YOU DESIGNED IT IN SOME IN A WAY THAT YOU KNOW ISN'T A RECTANGLE BUT STILL POINTED IN A DIRECTION THAT HAD DEFINITE POINTS
SO IF THAT'S YOUR THING AND YOU GOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT INSTEAD AND THERE'S YOUR S YOU KN YOU KNOW WHICH WAY YOU'RE GONNA POINTING IT
UM
DOES IT SAY WHAT DOES IT SAY FOR N IT SAYS ON THERE WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR THE NEXT MEETING I THINK
T
UH UH UM
OKAY
I AM CORINNE WHITING AND I WILL BE THE MARKETING EXPERT AND IN EACH OF THE THREE PHASES I WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT ROLE
IN THE FUNCTION DESIGN PHASE I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
AND THIS MEANS WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED AND I'LL BE DOING RESEARCH TO FIGURE THIS OUT
IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE I WILL BE DEALING WITH TREND WATCHING AND I'LL BE DOING MARKETING RESEARCH ON THE WEB
AND THEN FINALLY IN THE UM DETAILED DESIGN PHASE I WILL BE DOING PRODUCT EVALUATION AND SO I WILL BE COLLECTING THE REQUIREMENTS AND RANKING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS TO SEE HOW WE DID
MM
HUH
OURS TOO
MM
CH
LIKE A TRACKING DEVICE
MM
BE GOOD
LOT MORE MODERN
MAYBE LIKE USER FRIENDLY LIKE A LITTLE
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN USE BOTH HANDS LIKE A LITTLE KEYBOARD TYPE THING
MM
MM
MM
ALSO SINCE WE'RE PARTNERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL REMOTE CONTROL ASSOCIATION MAYBE WE WANNA MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT WOULD GLOBALLY APPEAL
THAT'S MORE ON THE RESEARCH END BUT THE MARKETING
YEAH
AND MAYBE AS FAR AS DESIGN GOES MAYBE WE COULD HAVE DIFFERENT ONES FOR DIFFERENT TARGET AUDIENCES
'CAUSE MAYBE ONE WON'T APPLY TO ALL OF THE COUNTRIES WE'RE TARGETING
FUTURISTIC
MM-HMM
'KAY I'LL DRAW SOMETHING
WHAT
MY IDEA WAS JUST TO HAVE IT BE KIND OF LIKE A
KEYBOARD TYPE SHAPE YOU KNOW LIKE VIDEO GAMES L SO
BUT MAYBE I MEAN THAT WOULD BE KINDA BIG AND BULKY
WE COULD ALSO TRY TO DO THE HINGE THING SO IT COULD LIKE FLIP OUT THAT WAY
I DON'T KNOW
THAT'S MY IDEA
YEAH
MM
YEAH
TRUE
MM
THAT'S FINE
YOU'RE THE BOSS YOU'RE ALLOWED TO
YEAH
LOOKS COOL THOUGH
YEAH
MM
RIGHT
YEAH
SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT WE HAVE A WARNING TO FINISH
YEAH
MM
GREAT
OH
OKAY
THANKS FOR COMING TO THIS MEETING
S HOW WE DOING ON OUR REMOTE
WE HAVE SOME WE HAVE SOME IDEAS AND SOME UH
IDEAS FOR WHAT PEOPLE WANT
YEAH
ALRIGHT LET'S JUST GO OVER THE AGENDA REAL QUICK FOR THIS MEETING
SEE IF I CAN'T GET THINGS UH MOVING ALONG HERE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
UM I'LL GO OVER WHAT WE WENT OVER LAST TIME WHICH SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG
THEN I BELIEVE EACH OF YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION
UM I'VE WAS SENT A A COUPLE MORE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR REMOTE WHAT THEY WANT
UM THEN WE CAN COME TO A CONCLUSION ON UH WHAT WE WANT THE REMOTE TO DO UM AND HOW IT'S GOING TO DO IT HOPEFULLY
AND UH THEN WE'LL HAVE THE CLOSING
UM WHICH WE'LL HAVE FORTY MINUTES FOR
UH LET'S SEE THE LAST MEETING WE WENT OVER UM
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR LEADING THE MEETINGS KEEPING THE NOTES UH AND COMING UP WITH THE FINAL PRESENTATION
UM CORINNE IS OUR MARKETING EXPERT
SHE'S GONNA FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT UM THE CONSUMER WANTS
UM RYAN IS OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
AND MANUEL IS THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
SO YOU'RE GONNA COME UP WITH THE IDEAS RYAN AND YOU'RE GONNA PICK 'EM APART
UM WE DECIDED OUR REMOTE UH WE WANT IT TO BE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE UH THAT EVERYONE WOULD WANT
UM WE WANT TO BE MODERN UM FUN DIFFERENT
UH IT NEEDS TO BE STURDY UM EASY TO FIND SO WE GONNA HAVE THAT LOCATOR FUNCTION
UM AND WE WANT TO BE DIFFERENT
UM AND THEN WE WENT OVER A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT IDEAS
BALL SHAPED PHONE
THE KEYBOARD SHAPE
UM WE DECIDED THAT IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE ONE HANDED
SOMETHING WE COULD USE WITH ONE HAND
UM AND THAT WAS OUR LAST MEETING
SO UM WHY DON'T UM DO EACH OF YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION
OKAY
I'LL HAND IT OFF TO YOU AND UM
DOES ANYONE DO YOU WANNA GO FIRST
SO WE CAN MAYBE SEE WHAT UH WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT
TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE
YEAH YOU CLICK ON THAT GUY
YEAH
HIT F. EIGHT AGAIN
I THINK
YEAH
YOU WANT IT TO BE ON BOTH SCREENS OR JUST JUST YOURS
YEAH BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO HIT ESCAPE
AND THEN YOU CAN
YEAH
OH HIT F. EIGHT AGAIN
I KNOW
I DID THE SAME THING
AND THEN IT SHOULD COME UP
HERE SHORTLY
'KAY
I THINK OH GIVE US THE SLIDESHOW AND SOMETHING ON YOUR SCREEN
MM
I'M NOT SURE
YOU COULD MAYBE MINIMISE THAT SCREEN AND THEN
HAVE THEM BOTH UP AT THE SAME TIME I THINK
'KAY
VERY NICE
NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME IDEAS OF WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON
UH
WAIT CAN I LOOK AT THAT REAL QUICK
WHAT WAS YOUR LAST CONCLUSION ON THAT ONE
FOCUS ON UH THE I
THE IMAGE OF IT
'KAY
GOOD
GOOD
SO WE COULD THE THE THE MORE COMPLEX WE MAKE IT OF COURSE THE MORE EXPENSIVE
BUT PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THEY WOULD WELL YOUNGER GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY MORE FOR A SPEECH RECOGNITION REMOTE
SO
POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE WORTH THE INVESTMENT
I AGREE
WELL
I MYSELF I FIND WHEN YOU H WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE SPEE SPEECH RECOGNITION
LIKE UH YOU CALL ON THE PHONE AND YOU TRY TO CHANGE YOUR TELEPHONE OR POWER OR SOMETHING
SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A A SPEECH RECOGNITION ON THE OTHER END AND YOU SAY ONE FOR THIS
AND YOU FIND YOURS LIKE YOU SAID SAYING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER
I FIND MYSELF ESPECIALLY IF I'M IN A CROWD OF PEOPLE LOOKING REALLY SILLY
SO MAYBE IF YOU'RE SITTING ON YOUR COUCH WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THEN
YOU KNOW YOU
VOLUME UP
VOLUME DOWN
CHANGE THE CHANNEL YOU KNOW CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN
I I DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
IT'S A IT'S A GIMMICK FACTOR THAT THEY LIKE AT FIRST AND
OKAY
UM
LET'S SEE HERE
YEAH I GUESS SO
TRADE YOU
NOW I WAS SENT A COUPLE OF
THINGS TO MODIFY OUR UH NEW REQUIREMENTS
UM THE REMOTE'S ONLY GONNA BE FOR THE TELEVISION
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE WE ALREADY DECIDED Y YOUR YOUR RESEARCH SHOWED THAT UH NOT ONLY IS A UNIVERSAL REMOTE MORE COMPLICATED
IT'S MORE COST MORE COSTLY
AND YOUR RE UH RESEARCH SHOWED THAT YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN USE IT
I THINK UH YOU SAID FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ONLY USE HALF THE OR TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
SO IF WE REMOVE THE UNIVERSAL REMOTE THEN THAT SOLVES THAT PROBLEM
UM NO TELETEXT
UM
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
UM BUT WE DO HAVE TO USE THE THE COMPANY WANTS US TO INCORPORATE THE CORPORATE COLOUR AND OUR SLOGAN WHICH IS WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
AND OUR CORPORATE COLOURS ARE GREY AND YELLOW
AND WE COULD PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH BLACK TOO BUT
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE UM THE THREE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT I WAS TOLD
WE NEED TO USE
UM FROM ALL ALL THREE OF YOUR UH PRESENTATIONS I THINK THAT WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK A LOT IN OUR LAST MEETING
UM
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD
UM WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S SIMPLE
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN FIND EASILY
UM
AND THE SPEECH RECOGNITION I I GUESS IS KIND OF UH GIVE OR TAKE
IT'S GONNA COST MORE
S THE YOUNG THE YOUNGER PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY LIKE IT
BUT UM IT'S
PROBABLY I WOULD SAY PROBABLY NOT WORTH THE INVESTMENT AT THIS POINT IN TIME
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST DO AWAY WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION
UM
AND THAT WAY WE CAN FOCUS ON OUR FORM
THAT'D BE THAT'D BE GOOD IF WE WERE GOING WITH OUR OUR BALL
OR OR WITH YOU KNOW I GUESS WITH ANY FORM THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD
YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE THE CHARGER
FOR YOU KNOW WE COULD USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES IN THE REMOTE
AND THAT WOULD BE OR SOLAR
OR YOU KNOW HOWEVER HOWEVER YOU WANTED TO GO ABOUT IT THE HOLDER COULD ALSO BE THE CHARGING UNIT
UM
WITH THE LOCATOR BUTTON
UM AND IF IT WERE THE BALL YOU'D NO LONGER HAVE TO HAVE A FLAT SPACE ON IT
UM LIKE IF WE STILL HAVE THE HOW TO HOLD ON TO IT AND
IT'S GONNA ROLL AWAY
UM
SO I GUESS AFTER THE MEETING WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONNAIRES
AND UH
AND SOME SUMMARIES FOR FOR WHAT'S GOING ON
UM THEN WE'LL TAKE LUNCH
THEN WE CAN COME BACK AND UH WORK ON OUR INDIVIDUAL WORK
UM
I'LL DO THE MINUTES
UH LET'S SEE
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY ON YOUR WAY FOR UH
WORKING WITH THE COMPONENTS
UM CHIPS THE WHAT CHIPS WE NEED AND WHAT UH
YOU KNOW HOW TO POWER IT AND WHATNOT
USER INTERFACE CONCEPT WE WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING SIMPLE
UM
MINIMAL NUMBER OF BUTTONS
I GUESS OUR I GUESS OUR MAIN UM
MAIN THING THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON UNTIL THEN IS PROBABLY DECIDING ON A CERTAIN LOOK YOU KNOW
DID YOU HAVE TIME EARLIER TO TO WORK ON THAT
DID YOU GUYS FEEL YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME IN BETWEEN OUR MEETINGS TO GET EVERYTHING DONE THAT YOU NEED TO GET DONE
'KAY
MM-HMM
UM
SHALL WE MAYBE SHOOT FOR A A SPECIFIC UH TARGET GROUP
THAT WAY WE COULD L I MEAN
IF IT WERE IF WE WERE SHOOTING FOR YOUNG GUYS THEN IT'S UM A CERTAIN LOOK TO THE REMOTE
OR GIRLS OR OLDER PEOPLE
UM
WOULD THAT YOU THINK THAT WOULD HELP US FIND UM A SPECIFIC FORM
THAT WE WOULD WOULD WANNA PICK OUT
'KAY
SO
UM WE KNOW THAT THE REMOTE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE WE'LL JUST SAY WE'VE GOT A COLOUR SCHEME FOR IT
UM YELLOW AND YOU KNOW YELLOW IT'S NICE AND BRIGHT WITH THE BUTTONS BEING GREY OR BLACK
AND OUR SLOGAN PASTED SOMEWHERE ON IT ON THE THE BOTTOM OR THE YOU KNOW
UM
MAYBE WE COULD SKETCH A SO BASICALLY
ALL OF OUR REMOTES ALL OF OUR TYPICAL REMOTES NOW ARE JUST KIND OF A RECTANGULAR SORT
YOU KNOW
UM MAYBE WE COULD FLARE IT OR SOMETHING
YOU KNOW
SO IT'S MORE OF COURSE THIS WILL LOOK LIKE A BONE THEN
GO AHEAD AND ERASE THIS
UM
HOPE EVERYONE MEMORISED THAT UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH EVERYBODY'S GOT A MOBILE PHONE RIGHT
EXCEPT FOR ME NOW
UH
BUT THEY ARE ALL YOU KNOW MOBILE PHONES UM THEY'VE KIND OF TAKEN A TURN TO WHERE THEY'RE REALLY SMALL
UM WHICH MAY DEFEAT OUR PURPOSE FOR BEING ABLE TO LOCATE OUR REMOTE ALL THE TIME
BUT THEN AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT YOU KNOW LIKE THE FIRST MOBILE PHONE THAT WAS THIS BIG AND YOU HAD A HANDBAG TO CARRY IT AROUND IN
UM
SO WE'VE GOT BASICALLY WHAT
REMOTES LOOK LIKE NOW IS KIND OF WHAT WE'RE
WHAT WE'RE STUCK WITH
UM
MAYBE WE COULD GO WITH A SQUARE OR SOMETHING
UM
UM YOU KNOW WITH MINIMAL NUMBER OF BUTTONS
I GUESS YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW ONE THROUGH NINE
FOR TYPING IN YOUR CHANNELS
UH YOU'VE GOT
VOLUME UP AND DOWN
CHANNEL UP AND DOWN
POWER
USUALLY AT THE TOP
UM A MUTE
THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL YOU NEED I THINK
UM
A MENU BUTTON MAYBE
SO YOU KNOW
IF YOU
IF WE WANT THE REMOTE TO DO OTHER THINGS LIKE UM OR I GUESS THE T. V. TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE TINT AND THE COLOUR AND YOU KNOW ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT ARE BUILT INTO T. V. S
WE JUST HAVE THAT UNDER ONE STANDARD MENU BUTTON WHERE YOU GO IN PRESS THE MENU BUTTON SCROLL UP AND DOWN TO SELECT IT
UM
'KAY SO
UM
MM-HMM
LIKE A WHEEL ON YOUR MOUSE
SORT OF
'S A GOOD IDEA
MM-HMM
LOOK G YEAH
LOOKS GOOD
TO THE THUMB
YEAH
YEAH IS EVERYONE WHO IN HERE'S RIGHT HANDED LEFT HANDED
YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT HANDED
YEAH
SO I'M LEFT HANDED BUT I SO I CAN SAY THAT MOST THINGS ARE DESIGNED FOR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE
LIKE THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE
OR ENGLISH
MAYBE
OW
I WOULD SAY I MEAN IT SHOULD BE PROBABLY DESIGNED FOR A RIGHT HANDED P PERSON
UM BUT THAT'S THAT'S GOOD
THAT'S W I THINK WE'VE GOT A KIND OF A GOOD PLAN THERE
UM
AT LEAST FOR WHAT BUTTONS WE'RE GONNA USE
UM
SO WE'VE GOT UH
I LIKE THE SCROLL THE SCROLL ACTION AND THE
YEAH
KINDA LIKE HOLDING A
YEAH
SO TWO REMOTES IN ONE
BUT THEN WOULD BE EASIER TO LOSE
ONE OR THE OTHER
IT ACTUALLY IS YOUR COFFEE TABLE
OKAY
WELL WE NEED TO FINISH UP HERE
UM
SO FOR THE NEXT
SO FOR THE NEXT UM BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING W UH SH SHALL WE WORK ON YOU'RE WATCHING TRENDS TO SEE WHAT WHAT KIND OF NEW INFORMATION WE'VE GOT GOING ON
UM
MANUEL YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON THE COMPONENTS FOR FOR WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE
LET'S GO WITH OUR OUR UH ROUNDED
KIND OF FIT IN YOUR HAND LET'S EXPLORE UH THE THE UH POSSIBILITY OF HAVING THE TWO PIECE
SO ONE FOR THE THE QUICK ZAPPING UM AND POSSIBLY ONE YOU KNOW WITH JUST THAT ROUNDED PART THAT FITS INTO YOUR HAND
UM
AND RYAN YOU WORK ON UM HOW HOW WELL THEY'LL WORK WITH THE US WITH THE USER
SO BOTH OF THOSE CONCEPTS
AND UH OKAY I THINK WE MADE SOME GOOD PROGRESS HERE
SEE YOU IN
I DUNNO
I GU I GUESS WE'LL TAKE LUNCH
IN ABOUT UH HALF AN HOUR
OR I GUESS WE'LL BE TAKING LUNCH SHORTLY AND THEN THEN IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER THAT WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE ANOTHER MEETING
OKAY
EIGHT
F. EIGHT
JUST JUS YEAH
CABLE THERE
THANK YOU
OKAY
GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN OF THE INTERIORS BASICALLY WHICH IS WHAT DICTATES THE DESIGN THE BOTH THE INTERFACE BASICALLY AND THE OUTER APPEARANCE BECAUSE THIS IS ALL THE STUFF THAT NEEDS TO GO IN THERE
RIGHT
SO UNFORTUNATELY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO
DO THIS LITTLE PRESENTATION FOR ME OBVIOUSLY WERE TOO DRUNK TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH IT SO UM I'M GOING TO DO A LOT OF THE STUFF ON THE BOARD
UM JUST
THIS IS THE BASIC
BASIC PREMISE OF A REMOTE CONTROL
UM THE BASIC FUNCTION IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO ANOTHER SYSTEM
OKAY SO MUCH IS CLEAR
AN ENERGY SOURCE FEEDS AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT LIKE A CHIP THAT CAN COMPOSE MESSAGES
OFTEN IN THE FORM OF INFRARED BITS
THIS IS THE MOST MOSTLY USED
UM THERE'S UH ALSO SOME SOUND SYSTEMS BUT INFRARED IS
THE BETTER OR THE MORE MORE USED SYSTEM
UM PARTS ARE CHEAPER AS WELL
A USER INTERFACE CONTROLS THE CHIP AND ACCORDINGLY THE MESSAGES
THIS IS WHERE MY PEOPLE SCREWED UP BASICALLY
SO I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT ON THE BOARD RATHER
UM WHAT WE HAVE IS DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT OBVIOUSLY NEED TO GO IN THERE
WE'LL START WITH AN ENERGY SOURCE
RIGHT
UM WHICH IS USUALLY A BATTERY RIGHT
SINCE IT'S NOT FEASIBLE TO ADD A CABLE TO THAT
THIS ENERGY SOURCE OF COURSE IS CONNECTED TO
THE
THE USER INTERFACE ITSELF
UH WHICH CAN BE BUTTONS WHATEVER WHICH IN FACT
CONTROLS A CHIP
RIGHT
THIS IS THE USER INTERFACE AND THERE WE HAVE THE CHIP
UM THE WAY THIS GOES NORMALLY IS THAT THIS CHIP THEN CONTROLS AN INFRARED LAMP
THAT SENDS OUT THE SIGNAL
OF COURSE THE SIGNAL DIFFERS ACCORDINGLY
UM DEPENDING ON WHAT THE CHIP TELLS THE INFRARED LAN LAMP
AND
OF COURSE THAT'S CONTROLLED THE CHIP ITSELF IS CONTROLLED BY THE USER INTERFACE
THE WAY YOU NORMALLY NORMALLY DO IT IS THAT YOU ADD A LITTLE DEVICE SUCH AS A LAMP
TO THE WHOLE THING AS WELL SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S WORKING BASICALLY
YOU PRESS SOMETHING YOU GET A RESPONSE
WHICH IS ALSO COMPARATIVELY UM IMPORTANT ON ONE OF THOSE DEVICES
NOW THIS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE OR WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE DISCUSSED ARE THESE TWO COMPONENTS MOSTLY
THE
THE UH ENERGY SOURCE FOR ONE THING CAN BE ALTERED
WHAT WE PROBABLY CANNOT ALTER IS OF COURSE THE INFRARED THE SENDING DEVICE BASICALLY THE INFRARED LAMP
WE CANNOT CHANGE THE CHIP WHICH CONTROLS THE INFRARED LAMP
RIGHT
THESE TWO ARE COMPONENTS THAT WE HAVE TO USE AND THESE ARE DICTATED BY THE WHOLE FUNCTION OF THE WHOLE THING
UM THE LAMP CAN BE PUT ONTO THE DESI THE DEVICE
IT C IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THERE
THIS CAN BE DISCUSSED AS WELL
THE USER INTERFACE
THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ALSO DISCUSS
UM AS WE'VE HEARD
UH SPEECH RECOGNITION IS THE HYPE OBVIOUSLY IN THE MOMENT
SPEECH RECOGNITION UM INTERFACE WE DON'T KNOW THAT
OR IF WE JUST DO THE USUAL BUTTON THING
OR WE HAVE A TOUCH PAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DISCUSS
AND OF COURSE THE ENERGY SOURCE
BATTERIES
SOLAR CELLS
WHO KNOWS
OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS A QUESTION WHETHER THESE THESE COMPONENTS ARE IN FACT AVAILABLE CHEAP ENOUGH DEVELOPED ENOUGH
BUT THAT'S LIKE I S I SUPPOSE RATHER UP TO MARKETING AND NOT TO
TO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN DEPARTMENT
EXPENSIVE IT'S GONNA BE GET UH
YEAH
RIGHT
OH RIGHT
GO
MM-HMM
WELL YOU STILL DO
YOU S YOU STILL
W YEAH
YOU PUT IT ON T ON THE COUCH TABLE
WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING IT'S GONNA ROLL OFF
SO THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE REALLY
RIGHT
THAT'S
MM
RIGHT
HM
THAT'S THE CLASSICAL DESIGN
RIGHT
YEAH
TALKING OF WHICH MAYBE A SCROLLING FUNCTION IS NOT NOT TOO BAD
IT'S
TALK ABOUT MAYBE F LOOK AT THAT FROM THE SIDE THERE MAYBE
WHICH IS TECHNICALLY THE EASIEST OPTION
WOULD PROBABLY BE LIKE A SCROLLING LITTLE SCROLLING WHEEL LIKE THIS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO
YEAH SORT OF LIKE THAT
YOU CAN EVEN
IF WE'RE COMING FROM MICE WE CAN EVEN ADD A CLICK FUNCTION WHERE YOU IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION YOU JUST PRESS IT DOWN
RIGHT
ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO THE ERGONOMICS OF THE WHOLE THING IF YOU WANNA MAKE IT SQUARE FOR THE LOOKS OF IT
THEN MAYBE TO MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE TO HOLD THE WHOLE THING YOU ADD A LITTLE BULGE DOWN HERE
JUST WHICH MAYBE FROM AN ENGINEERING POINT THIS COULD BE HOLDING THE THE BATTERIES AND SO ON
I KNOW
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT HERE FEL LOOK AT IT FROM THE SIDE
IT'S LIKE THAT
RIGHT
UH
THEN YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS
AND MAYBE YOU BRING THE BUTTONS NEARER TO THE OR THE IMP MORE IMPORTANT BUTTONS NEARER TO THE TO THE SIDE
RIGHT
MM
RIGHT
YOU CAN ALSO HAVE IT MAYBE TALKING ABOUT MOBILE PHONES AGAIN SLIDING OPEN
WITH THE LESSER USED FUNCTIONS ON THIS PART AND THEN IT SLIDES INTO THAT PART
AND OUT
MM WELL I WAS JUST THINKING THIS THIS OF COURSE CAUSES
CAUSES A PROBLEM UM FOR LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE ACTUALLY
SO
RIGHT
RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
RIGHT
THAT MINIMISES IT SIZE WISE AS WELL
MM
THEN THERE'S MAYBE
ANOTHER POINT OF MAKING IT A TWO IN ONE KIND OF THING
IF WE HAVE A SMALLER
A SMALLER DEVICE THAT ACTUALLY FITS INTO THE BIG ONE
YOU GIVE IT THE FULL FUNCTIONS IN HERE AND JUST A COUPLE OF FUNCTIONS IN THERE
LIKE YOUR ZAP ZAPPING DEVICE IS JUST U CHANNELS UP DOWN UH VOLUME AND ON OFF
THAT'S IT
MAYBE
THAT'S RIGHT
MEANS THE BIG ONE HAS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BIG
AND PERHAPS HEAVY SO YOU CAN'T MOVE IT AROUND
MAKE IT A PIECE OF FURNITURE
YES
YES THERE YOU GO
OR A STATUE OR SOMETHING
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
DU
UH WE YES S I'VE LO I'VE DONE THE ROLE THAT I WAS ASKED TO DO ANYWAY
I THINK
SLIDE SHOW
JUST PRESS THE ARROW KEYS I THINK
USUALLY GOES TO IT
IS IS IT J JUST JUST JUST USING IT YEAH
A REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
JUST REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
I THINK
THAT'S WHAT I GUESS
YEAH
HAVING JUST LISTENED TO WHAT CORINNE JUST SAID I'LL DRAW ON SOME OF THE THINGS AS WELL
SOME THINGS THAT SORT OF RELEVANT TO WHAT I WANNA SAY
'KAY SO I'M JUST GONNA YEAH APPROACH THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
UM THE METHOD I USED WAS TO EXPLORE THE UH TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF A REMOTE CONTROL
AND T S SIMPLEST APPROACH THAT I CAME TO IS IS TO CHANGE PROGRAMME AND OPERATE AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE REMOTELY
I MEAN THAT'S AN OBVIOUS THING TO SAY BUT IT'S NOT ATTACHED TO THE DEVICE THAT YOU WANT TO CONTROL
UM I HAD SOME THINGS SENT TO ME
NOT VERY MUCH
TO LOOK AT SIMILAR DEVICES
UM DEFINED IN SOME THEM
AND THEN THE PERSONAL PREFERENCES THAT I WILL SUGGEST
UM WE DISCUSSED A UNIVERSAL ONE
UM LIKE IT'S JUST BEEN BROUGHT UP AGAIN THEN
BUT I THINK A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL IS ACTUALLY QUITE A DIFFICULT OBJECT TO DESIGN
AND PO POSSIBLY WITHIN MAYBE THE BUDGET THAT WE DO IT UM BECAUSE YOU'D NEED TO KNOW ALL THE SPEF SPECIFICATIONS OF A ALL THE LIKE ELECTRONIC COMPANIES
I'M NOT SURE HAVE YOU EVER COME ACROSS A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL YOURSELF
BUT YOU HAVE TO I THEY'RE A NIGHTMARE TO USE
YOU HAVE TO SET THEM RESET THEM TO EVERYTHING
UM AND THAT WOULD ONLY ADD BUTTONS
WHEREAS I THINK THE AIM IS TO TAKE AWAY BUTTONS
SO I THINK IT'D BE BETTER MAYBE TO CONCENTRATE ON MAYBE JUST A UNIVERSAL ONE FOR T. V. S
UM OR MAYBE JUST ONE THAT YOU COULD WE COULD DESIGN AND THEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE
MANUFACTURERS COULD USE IT TO SET TO THEIR SPECIFICATIONS IF IF THE AIM IS TO GET SOMETHING THAT'S UNIQUE IN DESIGN
UM
OKAY HERE HERE'S JUST TWO PICTURES OF REMOTE CONTROLS
THEY'RE JUST SIMPLE T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS
BUT ONE IS UH USER CENTRED
THAT IS THE ONE ON THE LEFT
AND YOU CAN STRAIGHT AWAY SEE THERE'S LESS BUTTONS
AND THE OTHER ONE IS ENGINEER CENTRED WHERE THAT'S MORE UH SPECIFIED FOR THE SORT OF THE ELABORATE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IT'S TRYING TO CONTROL UM
WHICH APPEALS MORE TO THE PRODUCT THAT WE WANT AND ON WHAT THE HAVE SAID AND THE MARKET RESEARCH AND STUFF PROBABLY LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE USER CENTRED
FEWER BUTTONS SIMPLER TO USE AND IF TEN PERCENT UM IS HIDDEN AWAY IF TEN PERCENT IS WHAT'S USED
MAYBE THE OTHER FIFTY PERCENT THE BUTTONS THAT ARE USED VERY RARELY LIKE PROGRAMMING
THEY COULD BE HIDDEN MAYBE UNDER SOME REMOTE CONTROLS YOU MIGHT HAVE COME ACROSS HAVE MAYBE A LITTLE FLIP THI THING WHERE THEY'RE HIDDEN AWAY
AND THE MAIN BUTTONS ARE THE ONES YOU OR THE ONES YOU COME ACROSS
UM AND FINALLY UM UH SORT I'VE SORT OF COVERED THAT OUR PRODUCT I THINK SHOULD BE USER INTERFACE ORIENTATED
UM
LIKE I SAID TO CONCENTRATE ON T. V. REMOTE CONTROL A UNIVERSAL REMOTE MIGHT BE TOO COMPLEX
UM AND AS WHAT IT THE MAJOR FINDINGS MARKET RESEARCHERS HAVE SAID IT'S THE IMAGE AND THE APPEARANCE THAT PEOPLE DI DISLIKE
SO THAT WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING THAT WOULD SET A TREND
AND THEN AND CHANGE THE FASHION OF REMOTE CONTROLS
AND THAT'S IT
ON SOMETHING ON THE IMAGE OF IT
UH THE F THE ACTUAL DESIGN
I THINK SPEECH RECOGNITION WAS
UH ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE UM THEY HAVE TO BE REALLY GOOD FOR THEM TO WORK
'CAUSE SOMETIMES YOU FIND YOURSELF JUST SAYING THINGS OVER AND O IF IT'S ON YOUR PHONE
AND YOU NEED TO SORT OF TAKE INTO LIGHT LANGUAGES AND THEN DIFFERENT DIALECTS I SUPPOSE AS WELL
YEAH
YEAH
AND WOU I DON'T KNOW IF WOULD WOULD YOU WANT TO KEEP SAYING STUFF IF YOU WERE WATCHING STUFF
IF YOU WERE WATCHING SOMETHING WOULD YOU SORT OF BE WANTING
YEAH
I THINK
AS WELL IT'D BE J THE GIMMICK FACTOR FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE
BUT PRACTICALLY I DON'T THINK IT'S
YEAH
IT'LL WEAR OFF
DO YOU WANNA PUT YOUR CORD BACK IN
I DID HAVE HAVE A THOUGHT ABOUT THE SORT OF THE TRACKING THING
IS THAT IF IT CAME WITH MAYBE A HOLDER
OR HOLSTER WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT
UM THAT YOU YOU SHOULD PUT IT BACK IN
YOUR REMOTE
BUT IF YOU DON'T PUT IT BACK IN YOU PRESS SOMETHING LIKE A LITTLE BUTTON ON THAT
AND THAT JUST SORT OF SENDS OUT A BEEP TO FIND WHERE IT IS OR SOMETHING
JUST BY INFRARED
THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO COMPLEX I WOULD'VE THOUGHT
YEAH IT WOULD BE QUITE GOOD
THE BALL COULD SIT ON A
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I'LL YEAH I'LL HAVE A LOOK TRY LOOK AT THE ACTUAL APPEARANCE IN THE NEXT BREAK
I TH I I DO STILL THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS ULTIMATELY ONE HANDED
THE BALL IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA
AND EVEN SOMETHING THAT'S HELD LIKE THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT
SO THAT I THINK IT STILL HAS TO BE A VARIATION
ON MAYBE A
A RECT ON A RECTANGLE BUT MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY AS
BORING AS PLAIN AS A RECTANGLE
D I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MIGHT COPE WITH LIKE THE TREND WATCHING
I FIND ANYTHING MORE ON THAT
YEAH
BOTTOM PERHAPS YEAH
YOU I MEAN IT MIGHT BE TO LOOK AT SORT OF THE THE SHAPE AND TREND OF LIKE THINGS LIKE MOBILE PHONES
AND THE SHAPES THAT THE THEY'VE BEEN GOING
THEY'VE GONE FROM BIG BRICK BLOCK THINGS WHICH IS A REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SORT OF SLINKY SMALL THINGS
YEAH
YES S
TO THE THUMB YEAH
MAYBE THE BUTTONS COULD LIKE UH
DECREASE IN S THE BIGGER ONES YOU KNOW THEY COULD ACTUALLY BE BIGGER IN SIZE THAN THE ONES THAT ARE LESS IMPORTANT THE SMALLER HERE
YEAH
BEHIND
DEFINITELY
JUST LIKE O ON A SORT OF SIDE VIEW
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULD SORT OF FIT IN THE HAND BETTER
SO YOU KNOW YOU JUST SORT OF HAVE YOUR HAND
YEAH
RIGHT ON THE AND YOUR THUMB WOULD BE UP HERE TYPE THING
YEAH THAT'S ALSO TRUE
INSTANTLY SORT OF ALWAYS GOING FOR THE RIGHT HANDED PERSON
BUT I MEAN THE OLDER SO
RIGHT HANDED YEAH
I MEAN I'M JUST JUST THINKING MAYBE
IF IT WAS UM
CIRCULAR
UM
WITH THE SORT OF THAT SORT OF THE SORT OF EARLY IDEA WE HAD WITH THE WAY THAT WAS MORE LIKE THAT
WHEREAS THIS IS JUST A ONE HANDED THING THAT YOU SORT OF ALMOST WRAP ROUND THE THUMB
SO YOU'D HAVE YOUR YOU'D PUT YOUR HAND INTO THERE WITH THE THUMB THERE
AND THEN YOUR THUMB WOULD DO YOU'D HAVE ALL THE BUTTONS SORT OF ROUND HERE
AND THAT I THINK COULD WORK
ON ANY HAND
IF YOU JUST HAD IT LIKE WRAPPED ROUND THERE
LEFT OR RIGHT
MINIMISE ITS SIZE
IT COULD BE YOU KNOW REALLY QUITE SMALL
YEAH
ZAPPING FUNCTIONS
YEP
YEAH
HOW WELL IT'LL WORK YEAH
YEAH
HM
YEP
SURE
WHAT WAS IT
FUNCTION
F. EIGHT
WELL
HOW DO I GET IT
OH RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
THAT ONE
OKAY
ALRIGHT
WELL THIS IS MY REPORT WHICH IS GOING TO BE BASED PRETTY MUCH ON A SURVEY THAT I WAS SENT
OH GOSH I'VE NO IDEA
G
OKAY
SORRY I ACTUALLY NEED
TO SEE SOMETHING ELSE ON MY SCREEN
YEAH
AND THEN
AGAIN
NO I WANT SOMETHING ELSE ON MINE
IS THAT POSSIBLE
OKAY BUT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT
SORRY GUYS
SO IS THERE NO WAY I CAN GIVE YOU THE SLIDESHOW AND
HAVE SOMETHING YEAH
YEAH
OH WELL
YEAH
IT'S OKAY
OKAY
UM SO FIRST OF ALL THE METHOD THAT I USED WAS BY DOING SOME MARKETING RESEARCH BY UM DOING RESEARCH ON SOME INTERVIEWS THAT WERE CONDUCTED
AND THEN SOME INTERNET RESEARCH
AND I WAS SENT A REPORT THAT WAS I THINK THERE WERE A HUNDRED REMOTE USERS THAT THEY INTERVIEWED
AND SO I WILL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE RESULTS FROM THAT WHICH I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL
UM OKAY HERE ARE SOME OF THE FINDINGS
THEY SAID THAT THE USERS DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THEIR CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS FIND THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS TO BE UGLY
WHICH IS A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER I WOULD SAY
AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE USERS WOULD BE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY IF THEY COULD GET A REMOTE THAT WOULD LOOK FANCY
SO I THINK THAT EARLIER WE WERE ONTO SOMETHING WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVING IT BE A MODERN COOL LOOK I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY IMPORTANT
UM THEY SAY THAT CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS SAID THEY ZAP A LOT
AND IF ANYONE COULD CLARIFY WHAT THAT MEANS
ZAP DOES THAT JUST MEAN LIKE CHANGING THE CHANNEL
OKAY
UM AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS SAY THAT THEY'RE ONLY USING TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS ON THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE THEY KEPT TRACK OF THE FREQUENCY PER HOUR IN USING CERTAIN BUTTONS
AND SOME OF THEM IT LOOKS LIKE BARELY NEED TO BE INCLUDED AT ALL
OF COURSE CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED THE MOST FREQUENTLY
AND THEN TELETEXT WAS THE NEXT
VOLUME AND THEN POWER
AND THEN AUDIO SETTINGS AND SCREEN SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS WERE PRACTICALLY NEVER USED
SO I THINK WE COULD DEFINITELY ELIMINATE OR SOMEHOW COMBINE A LOT OF THE FUNCTIONS INTO ONE BUTTON
UM THE BIGGEST USER FRUSTRATIONS AS WE SAID FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE FIND THAT THEIR REMOTES ARE LOST SOMEWHERE
AND SO I THINK A TRACKING DEVICE OF SOME SORT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
THEY SAID IT TAKE THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAID IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE
AND TWENTY SIX PERCENT SAID THAT THE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR R. S. I.
WHAT IS IT
OKAY
OKAY
AND SO BAS OKAY
UM AS FAR AS SPEECH RECOGNITION GOES UM THE YOUNGER GROUP LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL FOR IT
FROM THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AGE GROUP OVER NINETY PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD PAY MORE
AND IT KIND OF JUST WENT DOWN INCREMENTALLY
THE GROUPS AT THE OLDER THEY GET IT LOOKS LIKE THE LESS WILLING THEY ARE TO PAY
SO MAYBE WE COULD DISCUSS THIS AND THINK AND DECIDE IF WE THINK IT'S WORTH INVESTING IN THIS
AT LEAST IF WE'RE TARGETING THE YOUNGER GROUPS
AND SO IN CONCLUSION
SOME THINGS THAT I DREW FROM THIS ARE THAT I THINK WE WERE CORRECT
WE DEFINITELY NEED TO FOCUS ON A NEW MODERN APPEARANCE SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE UGLINESS OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
UM A MULTIFUNCTIONAL REMOTE COULD BE A GOOD THING TO EXPLORE
SO YOU ONLY HAVE ONE RATHER THAN FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTES SITTING ALL OVER YOUR ROOM
UH WE NEED TO SIMPLIFY THE REMOTE AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS GET RID OF THE ONES THAT DON'T SEEM TO BE SERVING MUCH PURPOSE
AND THEN LASTLY I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WE COULD DISCUSS THE IDEA OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND THAT'S IT
OH YEAH
SORRY DID YOU GUYS GET TIME TO WRITE EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEEDED
'KAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
ANOTHER THING ABOUT THESE FIGURES IS NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THE YOUNGEST AGE GROUPS SAID THEY'D DO IT BUT PROBABLY A LOT OF THEM THAT'S ACTUALLY THEIR PARENTS MONEY
LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GO OUT AND PURCHASE THIS THEMSELVES A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD YOU KNOW
YEAH
GETS OLD YEAH
MM
MM
ROLLS AWAY YEAH
NOT REALLY
MM
MM
MM
YEAH NOT YET BUT MAYBE BY THE NEXT MEETING WE'LL HAVE SOME INFO ON THAT
MM
MM
POWER
YEAH
MM-HMM
RIGHT
UH-HUH
MAYBE YOU COULD BUY LIKE A SPECIAL LEFT HANDED VERSION OF THE REMOTE
SPECIAL ORDER
YEAH
MM
HMM
COULD BE GOOD
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
OKAY
ALRIGHT
IS EVERYONE HERE
OKAY
THIS IS OUR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
AND
I'LL JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES AND UH GO THROUGH THE PREVIOUS MINUTES
UM THEN EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE YOUR PRESENTATION UM AND THEN WE WILL NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ON THE CONCEPT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES FOR FINISHING UP
UM
I'LL GO THROUGH THE MEE THROUGH THE MINUTES FIRST
UM WE JUST REFRESHED OUR OUR UH GOAL OF MAKING THE FINEST REMOTE CONTROL AVAILABLE
UM WE DECIDED THAT OR WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO USE COMPANY COLOURS COMPANY LOGO
UM AND
OUR MARKETING EXPERT UH GAVE US SOME I UH INFORMATION FROM INTERVIEWS WITH A HUNDRED DIFFERENT REMOTE USERS
UM WITH SOME STATISTICS THAT BACKED BASICALLY WHAT WE WERE THINKING BEFORE
PEOPLE THOUGHT THEIR REMOTES WERE UGLY UM
UM
THAT REMOTES ZAP A LOT
UM THEY ONLY USE UH A FINITE AMOUNT OF BUTTONS
UM AND THAT THEY OFTEN LOSE THE IT'S EASY TO LOSE A REMOTE
UM WHICH WERE ALL THINGS WE WERE THINKING WE WOULD WANNA MAKE IT SIMPLE
UM
AND UH SOME SORT OF LOCATOR
EITHER A BUTTON OR TRACKING DEVICE
UM
AND THAT IT SHOULD LOOK DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S OUT THERE
UM
KIND OF MIXED MIXED RESPONSE ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
THE YOUNGER PEOPLE SAID THEY WANTED IT OLDER PEOPLE DID NOT
UM UH I THINK WE DECIDED THAT
UM THE EXPENSE WAS NOT NECESSARILY WORTH IT AND THAT IT WAS PROBABLY A GIMMICK THAT UM WOULD INCREASINGLY WEAR ON THE CONSUMERS' NERVES
UM
THEN THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER UM EXPLORED SOME OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE
UM THE SIMPLE VERSUS THE UM THE COMPLEX
THE SIMPLE ONE BEING BETTER FOR A USER THE COMPLEX BETTER FOR AN ENGINEER
UM
UM AND SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES THAT WERE FOUND IN THAT WOULD BE THAT IT SHOULD BE A USER ORIENTED REMOTE SOMETHING SIMPLE
UM AND THAT WE DIDN'T WANNA GO WITH A UNIVERSAL REMOTE BECAUSE UH INCREASING COST AND INCREASING COMPLEXITY
UM WE WOULD JUST HAVE A T. V. REMOTE
UM AND THAT WE SHOULD ALSO FOCUS ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE REMOTE
HAVE IT S BE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT
AND FINALLY OUR UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UH GAVE US A RUNDOWN OF HOW THE REMOTE WILL WORK
UM FROM ENERGY SOURCE UM UH WHAT WE WOULD USE
BATTERIES BECAUSE WE DON'T WANNA HAVE A A CABLE
UM
HOW THAT WOULD POWER THE REMOTE AND THE LAMP
IF WE WERE TO TO HAVE ONE
UH UM THE USER INTERFACE THEN WOULD CONNECT TO A CHIP WHICH WOULD WORK WITH THE INFRARED CONTROLS UH TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO THE T. V.
UM
I BELIEVE THEN WE CAME UP WITH A COUPLE OF IDEAS FOR WHAT WE THINK THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE WILL BE
UM
UM SOMETHING THAT WILL FIT INTO UH EASILY INTO SOMEONE'S HAND
AND WITH A JUST A FEW BUTTONS
JUST THE BASICS
AND WITH A SCROLLING UM FUNCTION ALSO
OKAY AND I WILL LEAVE THAT LEAVE IT AT THAT
SO
MARKETING
WE'RE WATCHING TRENDS
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU CAN HAVE THIS
A BANANA SHAPE
SO POSSIBLY LIKE A UH SORRY JUST TO BUTT IN FOR A SECOND
POSSIBLY UH LIKE A COVER LIKE THEY HAVE FOR MOBILE PHONES
YOU HAVE ONE WITH A FLAG AND ONE WITH A BANANA AND ONE THAT'S A SPONGY
FEEL TO IT
YOU CAN
MM VARIOUS COVERS
WE COULD LEAVE THAT TO THE COVER DEPARTMENT
WE ALL KNOW THEY'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO ALL DAY
NOTICE THE GIANT DOG BONE SHAPE
ALSO GOOD FOR ANIMALS
WHAT'S THE APPROXIMATE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE TITANIUM
WORKS WELL IN ARIZONA BUT IN EDINBURGH NOT SO
NO I THINK I THINK BATTERIES ARE PROBABLY THE WAY TO GO
YEAH
SO THE RU WAIT THE RUBBERY WE CAN SHAPE IT HOWEVER WE WANT
OR THE RUBBERY WE CANNOT
'KAY
MM
MM
YEAH
IS THAT AN OPTION A PLASTIC SHELL WITH A RUBBERY COATING ON AT CERTAIN SPOTS
WHAT ABOUT A SMELL
T TO THE REMOTE
YELLOW AND GREY
GRAPEFRUIT
I WOULD SAY IF I WERE TO MAKE A DECISION I WOULD PROBABLY PUT THE FRUIT ASPECT AT THE LOWER LOWER END OF THE SPECTRUM OF OF IMPORTANCE
UM
WELL PERHAPS THE IMPLIED SHAPE WILL BE ENOUGH TO LURE THAT FRUIT MINDED REMOTE BUYER
IT'S IT'S YELLOW
IT'S CURVED
IT'S SORT OF COUPLE OF COUPLE OF GREY STRIPES
WE COULD PUT THE GREY STRIPES ON THE BOTTOM SO THAT THAT PERSON COULD TURN IT OVER
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A BANANA JUST SITTING ON THEIR TABLE
RATHER THAN RATHER TH
MAYBE THE HOLDER IF WE WERE TO HAVE A HOLDER IT COULD BE SHAPED LIKE A FRUIT
COULD BE IT COULD BE AN APE OR A FRUIT BOWL
HEY WE COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS HERE
DO YOU HAVE MORE TO YOUR PRESENTATION
OH
OKAY
I'M GONNA PLUG IN HERE REAL QUICK
IF I COULD
LIKE I SAID WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ON
A COUPLE OF THESE ITEMS HERE
UM OW
OW
MM-HMM
OKAY
UH SO THESE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE BY THE END OF THIS MEETING
UM FOR OUR COMPONENTS CONCEPT WE NEED TO COME UP WITH THE ENERGY SOURCE UM THE CHIP ON PRINT AND THE CASE
PROBABLY CASE UM MATERIAL
AND PROBABLY A SHAPE ALSO
UM AND THEN FOR THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT THE TAPE WHAT WHAT THE TYPE IS
AND WHAT KIND OF SUPPLEMENTS WE'LL HAVE
UM
ENERGY SOURCE I THINK WE'VE I THINK WE'VE DECIDED BATTERIES ALTHOUGH NOT EXCITING ARE PROBABLY OUR BEST BET
AND WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES
'KAY
SO
UM I GUESS WE SHOULD PICK THE CASE THEN
IF WE GO WITH THE PLASTICKY CASE OR THE THE PLASTIC CASE UM
THEN THE CHIP ON PRINT IS STILL KIND OF WE COULD HAVE EITHER OR
WE COULD HAVE A COMPLEX ONE OR A A NON COMPLEX
BUT DID WE DECIDE THAT THE RUBBERY FEEL WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO US
OKAY
SO WE WOULD WE WOULD HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
'KAY
SO I GUESS THE CASE WOULD BE PLASTIC WITH
PERHAPS THAT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH RUBBER TO QUALIFY AS BEING PART OF IT
IT'S MORE OF A SU IT'S MORE OF A SUPPLEMENT MAYBE
WHICH WILL REQUIRE A MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP ON PRINT RIGHT
'KAY
SO
I GUESS THAT IS THAT IS THAT ABOUT IT
SO WE HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TO DO ON THIS
UM OKAY SO WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER MEETING IN THIRTY MINUTES
UM
HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA BE GOING ON
UM
UM RYAN YOU'LL BE WORKING ON THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
UM
MANUEL YOU'LL BE WORKING ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
CORRINE WE'LL WANT A PRODUCT EVALUATION
AND THE TWO OF YOU GET TO PLAY WITH THE UH MODELLING COMPONENTS AND UH
MAYBE AND AND GET US A PROTOTYPE
WHICH SHOULD GO ALONG WELL WITH YOUR LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN AND YOUR INTERFACE
SO THAT BASICALLY JUST BE WORKING ON THE PROTOTYPE UH WE'LL ACCOMPLISH YOUR OTHER TWO ACTIONS
ALRIGHT
OKAY
LET'S DO IT
ALRIGHT
THAT'S INDUSTRIAL DESIGN FOR CRANES STUFF LIKE THAT
MAKES SENSE MAKES SENSE
UH
WELL LET'S SEE
I'M GOING TO BORE YOU WITH A
COUPLE OF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INTERIOR
JUST TO TO MAKE IT MORE OBVIOUS WHAT WE HAVE TO FIT IN THERE AND THAT WE DO HAVE TO FIT THE STUFF IN THERE
I'VE MORE INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE MATERIALS UM AS WELL
WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT DO
UM BUT LET'S JUST WAIT FOR THIS TO LOAD UP AND I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE
OKAY
THE DETAILS OF THE COMPONENTS' DESIGN AS YOU CAN SEE THERE WHAT WE HAVE IS THE BOARD MAIN BOARD OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
THE UNDERSIDE THAT'S PRETTY CHEAP PIECE OF OF TECHNOLOGY REALLY TOP LEFT SIDE YOU CAN SEE THE CHIP
WHICH IS THE WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS WAS IS THE DEVICE TO RECOGNISE THE SIGNALS THE INPUT
AND IT PASSES IT ON TO A ROW OF UM FURTHER TRANSISTORS AND STUFF LIKE THAT ON THE RIGHT SIDE THAT ACTUALLY AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL
WHICH LATER ON IS BEING IS BEING TRANSFERRED TO A INFRARED LAMP WHICH
THEN UM OF COURSE SHINES INFRARED LIGHT ONTO THE TELEVISION WHICH THEN WILL RECOGNISE WHAT SIGNAL UM IT'S GETTING AND WILL DO WHAT YOU TELL IT
UM
SO MUCH FOR THE THE WORKINGS OF THE
OF THE UH
REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
ITS JOB IS TO WAIT FOR YOU TO PRESS A KEY THEN TO TRANSLATE THAT KEY PRESS INTO INFRARED LIGHT SIGNALS UM THAT ARE RECEIVED BY THE TELEVISION
WHEN YOU PRESS A KEY UM YOU COMPLETE A SPECIFIC CONNECTION
THE CHIP SENSES THE CONNECTION AND KNOWS WHAT BUTTON YOU PRESSED
IT PRODUCES A MORSE CODE LINE SIGNAL SPECIFIC TO THAT BUTTON
RIGHT
PRETTY CLEAR
TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIES THE SIGNAL AND THEN SENDS THE M SENDS THE SIGNAL TO THE L. E. D. WHICH TRANSLATES THE SIGNAL INTO INFRARED LIGHT
THE SENSOR IN THE T. V. CAN SEE THE INFRARED LIGHT AND SEEING THE SIGNAL REACTS APPROPRIATELY
THIS IS THE CIRCUIT BOARD FROM THE OTHER SIDE
UM THE LOWER PART OF IT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THAT PROPERLY
WITH THE GREEN GREENISH BOARD IS IS WHAT WE WHAT WE SAW IN THE FIRST THE FIRST SLIDE JUST FLIPPED OVER
UM YOU CAN SEE THE CIRCUIT BOARD ITSELF
THAT'S THE CHEAPEST UH WAY TO MAKE ELECTRONIC CONNECTIONS BASICALLY ON THE MARKET
UM WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE DON'T HAVE CABLES BUT YOU HAVE THE CONNECTIONS ACTUALLY IN THESE IN THESE LINES ON THE ON THE BOARD
THESE ARE THE ACTUAL KEYS THAT ARE BEING PRESSED
THEY CLOSE THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT
THAT THEN SENDS THE SIGNAL TO THE CHIP ON THE OTHER SIDE
THAT WOULD BE BEHIND HERE
UM WHICH UH SENDS IT OVER TO THE TRANSISTORS AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT
AMPLIFY THE SIGNAL AND ALL THAT IS BEING SENT TO THE INFRARED LAMP UP THERE
NOW AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE THE RUBBER BUTTON VERSION OF IT
UM THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT YOU HAVE THE KEYS HERE
THE RUBBER BUTTON HAS A LITTLE METAL UH PLATE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH CLOSES THE CIRCUIT HERE
AND THUS GIVES ON THE SIGNAL
NOW THIS IS THE SIMPLE VERSION
UM WE ARE TALKING UM THIS THIS THE SIMPLE AND CHEAPEST VERSION AT THE SAME TIME
WE ARE TALKING SOMETHING MORE COMPLICATED OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE AS WELL
AND NOT ONLY THAT
UM WE ARE ALSO RESTRICTED IN THE USE OF OUR OUTER SHELL OR IN THE MATERIAL THAT WE COULD USE FOR OUR OUTER SHELL
UM I'VE GOTTEN SOME INFORMATION THAT
WE COULD USE FOR THE CASE MATERIAL PLASTIC
RUBBER AS WELL
UM RUBBER THAT IS USED IN THESE ANTI STRESS BALLS
SO IT'S PRETTY SQUISHY
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD SERVE THAT PURPOSE
UM WE COULD ALSO USE WOOD OR TITANIUM
OH FYA I DON'T HAVE AN INFORMATION ON THAT
HOWEVER OUR COMPANY OBVIOUSLY CAN PROVIDE US WITH UH WITH THE TITANIUM SO I ASSUME I'M I WAS GIVEN AN OKAY TO USE IT
IT CERTAINLY IS AN EXPENSIVE MATERIAL I'M AWARE OF THAT BUT I WAS GIVEN AN OKAY
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS TO CERTAIN MATERIALS
NOW LET'S FIRST GO THROUGH THE LIST WITH THE MATERIALS
SO WE WHAT WE CAN USE IS PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD AND TITANIUM
CAN ALSO MIX THESE
UM AS FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE UM WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT SHORTLY IN THE OTHER MEETING
UM WHAT WE COULD USE IS OR WHAT I WAS OFFERED OR WHAT WE COULD USE IS A BASIC BATEER BATTERY
RIGHT
UH A DYNAMO
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH
UM WE COULD USE SOLAR CELLS
OR A DEVICE THAT WAS NOT N NOT FURTHER SPECIFIED THAT PROVIDES KINETIC ENERGY
SUCH AS LIKE WATCHES YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU JUST MOVE THEM
M MOVE THE THE ACTUAL DEVICE AND THIS PR UH PROVIDES IT WITH WITH UH SOME ENERGY
SO UM OBVIOUSLY
I PERSONALLY HAVE TO SAY THAT DYNAMO IS OUT OF THE QUESTION REALLY
YOU DON'T WANNA WIND UP YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE YOU CAN USE IT RIGHT
UM SOLAR CELL IS INTERESTING
MAY FAIL THOUGH EVERY HERE AND THERE
MM
YEAH
OR YOU KNOW YOU LOSE IT IT LIES BEHIND THE COUCH FOR A WEEK AND YEAH MM
ALWAYS THE YOU
BUT EXACTLY
UM THE KINETIC ENERGY THING UM MIGHT WORK UM BUT THE SAME PROBLEM
YOU LEAVE IT LYING AROUND AND YOU FIRST HAVE TO SHAKE IT BEFORE IT IT STARTS TO WORK
SO I'D SAY WHAT WE'RE STUCK WITH REALLY IS UM THE BASIC BATTERY
WHICH ALSO MAKES A BASE STATION BASICALLY OBSOLETE
WE DON'T NEED THAT THEN
UM
HOWEVER
OUR INTERFACE OPTIONS ARE PUSH BUTTONS
IN WHICH UH IN THE PRODUCTION OF WHICH OR IN MANUFACTURE OF WHICH UM OUR COMPANY IS EXPERT
UM
HOWEVER WE'VE DISCUSSED THAT SCROLL WHEELS ARE A BETTER OPTION
AND THEY ARE POSSIBLE
WE HAVE AN OKAY FOR SCROLL WHEELS
OKAY
UM HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO THE SCROLL WHEEL OF THE IPOD
I'VE ONE BIG OBJECTION AND THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIT AN L. C. D. INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL AS WELL
THIS HOWEVER MAY EXCLUDE CERTAIN UM MATERIALS
IF YOU HAVE A SQUISHY UH KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL THEN AN L. C. D. SCREEN MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE MOVEMENT
HENCE WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT IN THERE
SO UM
THERE'S ALSO RESTRICTIONS TO WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHIP
IF WE HAVE A MORE SOPHISTIC UH SOPHISTICATED SCROLL WHEEL RATHER THAN THIS VERY BASIC UH SET UP THAT WE THAT I'VE JUST PRESENTED
UM THE CHIP HAS TO BE MORE S MORE SOPHISTICATED AND THUS MORE EXPENSIVE AS WELL
I DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS TO WHEN IT COMES TO THE COST BUT UM IT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE
I'D RATHER SAY DROP THE TITANIUM AND THEREFORE LET'S HAVE A MORE SOPHISTICATED CHIP BUT THAT'S NOT UP TO ME TO DECIDE REALLY
SO THAT'S FOR THE FOR THE SCROLL WHEEL
UM IT LIMITS OUR CHOICE AND SQUISHY IS HIP SO I'D SAY
RATHER NOT GO FOR FOR THAT
LET'S SEE NOW
UM UM SOLAR CELLS CANNOT BE USED ON A CURVED OR LATEX UM SURFACE OR UM REMOTE CONTROL
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM UM SINCE WE HAVE DECIDED OR AGAINST SOLAR CELLS I ASSUME RIGHT
OR IS ANYBODY STILL ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
UH WHICH MAKES IT VERY CONVENTIONAL BUT THEREFORE TRADITIONAL I ASSUME
UM
UM
WITH THE TITANIUM UM WE CANNOT MAKE IT A CURVED DESIGN
WE WOULD JUST BE ABLE TO MAKE IT FLAT AND
AND UM YEAH A STRAIGHT DESIGN PRETTY MUCH
WHICH I ASSUME WOULD EXCLUDE UH SOME OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED VERSIONS
YOU CAN HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN
UM BUT THEREFORE NO RUBBER WILL BE USED
ALRIGHT
SO PLASTIC YES TITANIUM YES BUT THIS WILL OF COURSE INFLUENCE THE FORM
WITH PLASTIC AS I UNDERSTAND IT YOU CAN USE ANY FORM
UM LATEX
IS TRICKY
OR RUBBER AND UM
AND TITANIUM ALSO SEEMS TO BE TRICKY WHEN IT COMES TO THE FORM
SO THE WAY TO GO IS IF YOU WANT A SCROLL WHEEL YOU EITHER MAKE IT FLAT AND ANGULAR UH ADD AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND UM
THEN YOU CAN BASICALLY CHOOSE EITHER PLASTIC OR TITANIUM
OR WOOD EVEN
UM IF YOU WANNA MAKE IT A PARTICULAR SHAPE USE PLASTIC
ADD AN L. C. D. SCREEN ADD A SCROLL WHEEL THAT'LL BE FINE
OR MAKE IT JUST PUSH BUTTONS
BASICALLY PLASTIC GIVES YOU THE B BIGGEST VARIETY OF OF OPTIONS
MAYBE NOT THE NICEST FEEL
OR NOT MUCH ORIGINALITY REALLY
WITH RUBBER WE COULD UH SH PRETTY MUCH SHAPE IT THE WAY WE WANTED IT BUT WE CANNOT ADD SCROLL WHEELS AND WE CANNOT ADD AN L. C. D. SCREEN
THAT'S THE TRICKY THING
S CERTAINLY CAN BE DONE YES
UM YEAH
IF THAT DOESN'T AFFECT THE FUNCTIONAL SIDE OF IT ALL
LIKE SAY JUST THE UNDERSIDE OR SO THEN IT CAN BE DONE
I ASSUME
YEAH
SO
THE FRUIT DESIGN UM
HOW ABOUT UM AFFECTING THE SURFACE OF THE ACTUAL UM REMOTE CONTROL
SAY WE DON'T MAKE IT P A PARTICULAR FRUIT SHAPE OBVIOUSLY BUT UH GIVE IT LIKE THE SURFACE OF
AN ORANGE BANANA WHATEVER
YOU NAME IT
JUST DESIGN WISE
MM
NICE ONE
MM
WELL WE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STICK TO THE COMPANY COLOURS THOUGH THAT'S YELLOW AND GREY
SO WHAT HAVE WE LEMON BANANA IS
GRAPEFRUIT IS WHAT WE'D GO FOR WHEN IT COMES TO THE OUTER APPEARANCE PERHAPS
BUT MM
WELL WE HAVE IT BANANA SHAPED ALREADY KIND OF
SO
RIGHT
I IT'S YELLOW
WELL SO WHY NOT ADD A COUPLE OF GREY STRIPES AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A BANANA
THERE YOU GO
IT COULD BE AN APE
YEAH
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
I INFORMED YOU ABOUT THE MATERIALS WHAT THE INTERIOR HAS TO LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE LIMITATIONS TO CERTAIN MATERIALS ARE ON THERE YOU GO
SURE
HANG ON
THERE YOU GO
WELL WE CAN STILL DESIGN A TWO PIECE UH REMOTE UM WITHOUT HAVING A BASE HAVING ONE OF THEM BE A BASE STATION
BUT JUST HAVE IT BE AN OPTIONAL EITHER BIG REMOTE WITH LOTS OF FUNCTIONS OR YOU TAKE OUT THE SMALLER PIECE
WE CAN STILL DO THAT
HOWEVER OF COURSE THIS WOULD BE LIKE DESIGNING TWO REMOTES PRETTY MUCH
SO UM WHICH THEN AS I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD PROBABLY LIMIT THE
LIMIT AGAIN THE THE THE USE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE
SAY LIKE HAVE A SCROLL WHEEL AND UH ON BOTH OF THEM OR HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND SO ON SO ON
YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE TO STICK RATHER WITH A JUST TRADITIONAL RUBBER BUTTON
DESIGN WHICH WE SAW THERE
BUT COULD BE DONE OF COURSE
RIGHT
OKAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHIP ON PRINT AS I SAID THE THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES YOU WANT
UM THE FANCIER THE CHIP HAS TO BE AND THE MORE EXPENSIVE
UH IF YOU WANT JUST A NORMAL BUTTON VERSION THE CHIP ON PRINT IS GONNA BE
A CHEAP ONE
RIGHT
YEAH
AS LONG AS THE PLA UH THE RUBBER IS NOWHERE NEAR THE CONTROLS YES
M MORE OF A L LAMINATION PERHAPS
YES
IT DOES
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEP
OH IT WAS SORT OF BANANA SHAPED
THOSE LIKE YEAH SORT OF SPONGY ONES
WHAT'S IT CALLED
CUST YOU PERSONALISED YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
WHY CAN'T I SEE THE CRAZY
UM YEAH I TALKING ABOUT THE INTERFACE CONCEPT AND HOW THE CUSTOMER RELATES TO WILL USE THE CONSUMER WILL USE THE ACTUAL DEVICE
UM SO I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE STUFF I WAS SENT UM TRY AND GET SOME INSPIRATION
BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR OWN IDEAS THAT WE HAD
UM I WAS SENT SOME INFORMATION FROM THE COMPANY SAYING THAT THEY
THE TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT HAVE DEVISED A NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU CAN PROGRAM QUESTIONS INTO SUCH DEVICES
THEY GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A COFFEE MACHINE WHERE YOU PROGRAM A QUESTION YOU PROGRAM THE ANSWER AND THE MACHINE RESPONDS ACCORDINGLY
UM OKAY
THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS OF A USER CAN USE PRODUCTS L LIKE A REMOTE
UM THERE'S A GRAPHICAL USE WHERE YOU YOU LOOK AT PICTURES AND
WELL ON A SCREEN
A COMMAND LINE WHERE YOU OBVIOUSLY TYPE THINGS IN AND YOU GET A RESPONSE
UM AND THEN IT JU THAT'S JUST TO POINT OUT THE SORT OF INCONSISTENT U SORT OF USE OF INTERFACE IN REMOTES
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THAT PICTURE WELL BUT THERE'S VARIOUS DIFFERENT REMOTES ONCE AGAIN WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS ON MAKING IT MORE COMPLICATED
SO THEN I HAD A LOOK AT NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET
NOT NECESSARILY REMOTE CONTROLS BUT ONES THAT YOU'LL RECOGNISE
UM THIS IS THE VOICE THERE IS A VOICE RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL WHICH CAN CONTROL MUS MULTIPLE DEVICES
I HAVE A THERE IS A PICTURE
YOU SURF YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS UH WITH YOUR VOICE
STORE UP TO EIGHTY SPEECH SAMPLES CONTROLS FOUR DEVICES T. V. CABLE SATELLITE V. C. R. D. V. D. AND AUDIO
AND YOU CAN RECORD YOUR OWN V VERBAL LABELS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE
UM THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DREW UP ON THE BOARD IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING
WHERE THERE HAS SCROLL DOWN FUNCTIONS ON THE SIDE
YOU CAN SORT OF JUST MAKE THOSE OUT
AND THEN ON THE RIGHT IS OBVIOUSLY AN IPOD WHICH IS YOU KNOW POSSIBLY ONE OF THE SIMPLEST THINGS TO USE OUT THERE
AND REALLY IS AND ALL THAT IS IS JUST A A NICE BIG SCROLL MENU THAT Y YOU SORT OF GO THROUGH
THAT IS A
POSSIBILITY
AND NOTHING'S SIMPLER REALLY
UM THEN THERE'S THINGS LIKE THIS WHICH IS A A A KID'S REMOTE
WHERE THE THE PARENTS HAVE THE FACILITY TO CONTROL AND PROGRAM WHAT CHILDREN CAN WATCH BEFORE
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL IT O ONLY ALLOWS THEM TO ACCESS THE CHANNELS THAT THEIR PARENTS WANT THEM TO WATCH
AND UM IT MEANS THAT TH CHILDREN HAVE A NOVELTY OF HAVING THEIR OWN REMOTE CONTROL
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF HAVING ONE REMOTE CONTR YOU KNOW LIKE WE JUST HAD TWO COMPONENTS
MAYBE IT CAN HAVE MORE COMPONENTS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT REMOTES
UM THE POINT MADE AT THE END THERE HERE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SORT OF BE NEED TO BE CLEAR ON YOUR UM DEVICES
AS TO WHAT YOU KNOW THINGS YOU USE
SOMETIMES AN ARROW POINTING DOWN WHICH MAY SUGGEST VOLUME DOWN COULD BECOME CONFUSED JUST AS A V. FOR VOLUME
JUST LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH WOULD NEED TO BE MADE CLEAR IN THE DESIGN
UM I THINK D CARRYING ON FROM WHAT I'VE ALREADY SAID A USER FRIENDLY REMOTE WITH MINIMUM BUTTONS
MAYBE WE'VE SO SUGGESTED THIS TWO PART THING
WHERE IF IT WAS TO HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION THING YOU COULD MAYBE CONTROL THAT ON THE DO IT OR PROGRAM ALL THAT ON THE CONTROL BIT
AND THEN JUST HAVE THE SIMPLE SORT OF HAND HELD THING THAT WE SORT OF DEVISED EARLIER AS THE ACTUAL REMOTE
UM I DON'T IT COULD BE A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY
THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTR THE ACTUAL CONTROL PORT MAYBE COULD HAVE LIKE AN IPOD WHERE YOU JUST SORT OF CONTROL THROUGH THE MENUS
STUFF LIKE GETS MORE AND MORE COMPLI COMPLICATED
AND THEN THE THE HAND HELD BIT SHOULD BE ERGONOMICALLY DESIGNED
AND THAT IS IT
WHY AM I
OH YEAH
JUST
WHERE ARE WE
UH
JUST TO SORT OF SHOW YOU
M THEY'VE EVEN GOT THINGS LIKE THAT
HUGE THINGS
WHICH IS JUST FOR YOUR GR NINETY YEAR OLD GRANDMA YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THAT YEAH
YEAH
SEE
THINGS
WHY'S MY SCREEN CRAZY
MM
WOULD YOU HAVE TO LEAVE IT BY THE WINDOW
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WOULD THE SORT OF SPONGY AND THE THE PLASTICKY THING Y YOU CAN GET THOSE MOBILE PHONES THAT INITIALLY HAVE A IT IS PLASTIC BUT THEN THEY HAVE SORT OF A A S A COVER ON IT WHICH IS JUST SORT OF SOFT AND STUFF
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD STILL BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE YOU KNOW IN PLASTIC
BUT THEN WHERE DO PEOPLE HOLD IT
JUST ALL BE SORT OF SPONGY
SO YOU AS THE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A A GRAPHICAL DISPLAY ON IT LIKE A SCREEN
LIKE THE IPOD
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
COULD WE NOT YOU KNOW HAVE A SHAPE WITH A SCROLL AND THE SCREEN
AND THEN J JUST SORT OF THAT INITIAL SHAPE WE HAD JUST WHICH IS UH SORT OF BANANA ESQUE
SO THAT'S THING IF WE DID IT YELLOW
AND UM YOU KNOW YOU JUST P STICK ON JUST SORT OF RUBBER THINGS THAT THAT SORT OF GRIP THE THUMB BIT
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY THEY'RE JUST ON THE EXTERIOR
THEY WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY TO THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF THE THING
YEAH
MM
YOU COULD JUST SELL IT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS AS WELL I SUPPOSE
IN DIFFERENT YE YELLOWS
I DON'T SUPPOSE WE HAVE TO STICK TO CO
STICK TO THE COLOURS YEAH
MM GRAPEFRUIT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND IF IT IF IT WAS DONE YELLOW WHICH IS A COMPANY COLOUR
YEAH
ON THE THE GR THE RUBBERY GRIPS COULD BE GREY
YEAH
IT COULD AND THEN YOU COULD ACTUALLY H PUT THE BANANA SHAPED THING ON THE FRUIT BOWL
ON THE COFFEE TABLE AND THEN PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS KNOW WHERE IT WAS
YEAH
YEAH
WELL WE SORT OF
RID OF THAT BECAUSE GONNA USE A BATTERY
AND THE BASE STATION MIGHT NOT BE NECESSARY
YEAH
YEAH
JUST JUST MAYBE YEAH
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO
I THINK
YEP
OKAY
YEP
CAN I HAVE YOUR CABLE PLEASE
THANKS
OKAY SO I WAS LOOKING AT TREND WATCHING
UM UNFORTUNATELY I WASN'T GIVEN TOO MUCH INFORMATION
I WAS GIVEN A BRIEF EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND THEN AN UPDATE ON SOME RECENT FASHION TRENDS THAT WE MIGHT LIKE TO LOOK AT
AND THEN I'LL JUST TELL YOU SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES THAT I GOT FROM THAT
UM OKAY THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDING WAS THAT THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL SEEMS TO BE TWICE AS IMPORTANT TO THE USERS AS THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
WHICH I THINK WE'VE KIND OF ALREADY DISCUSSED BEFORE
UM THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT FINDING WAS THAT THE REMOTE SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
AND AGAIN THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE'VE KIND OF ALREADY COME UP WITH ON OUR OWN BUT THIS JUST BACKS IT UP
AND THIRDLY THE REMOTE WOULD BE EASY TO USE
AS FAR AS FASHION UPDATE WE'VE LEARNED THAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHS SHOES AND FURNITURE
SO THAT MIGHT BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE TO INCORPORATE THIS INTO OUR REMOTE BUT WE CAN TRY
UM AND ALSO AS OPPOSED TO LAST YEAR THIS YEAR THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY IN FEEL
OKAY SO FROM THAT UM AS WE'VE ALREADY SAID WE NEED TO FOCUS ON A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
UM I THINK WE'VE ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO GO AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL RECTANGULAR DESIGN
BUT I THINK THAT EVEN IF IT'S VERY SUBTLE WE NEED TO KIND OF TRICK OUR CONSUMERS
SO THEY AT LEAST GET THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE GETTING SOMETHING THAT'S NEW AND MODERN AND SLEEK AND
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE SHAPE OR THE COLOURS OR ALL OF THAT
UM FOR TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE TRACKING DEVICE
WE BROUGHT UP THE IDEA OF HAVING TWO PIECES WHICH WE COULD DISCUSS FURTHER
AND MANUEL HAD SUGGESTED UM THE ENERGY SOURCE AND THE USER INTERFACE DISCUSSING SOME OF THOSE UM THAT WE COULD CHANGE A LITTLE BIT
WE NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE HAVE LIMITED BUTTONS WHICH I THINK THE TWO PIECE IDEA MIGHT BE REALLY BENEFICIAL FOR
UM WE NEED TO INCORPORATE THIS FASHION TREND OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I GUESS THE TWO OPTIONS ARE IF WE HAD OUR REMOTE IN THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
OR WITH EXTERIOR DESIGNS
BUT MY QUESTION IS I MEAN THE STEREOTYPICALLY SPEAKING YOU KIND OF PICTURE MALES WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS
AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY'D FEEL ABOUT HAVING FRUITY LOGOS ON THE OUTSIDE
SO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S SOMEWHAT REMOVABLE OR I DON'T KNOW DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR FEMALE MALE TARGET GROUPS
AND THEN THE SPONGY FEEL
I GUESS WE COULD LOOK AT MOBILE PHONES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT THERE
C AND LOOK AT DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIAL THAT MIGHT PLEASE OUR USERS WHO WANT SPONGY FEELING REMOTE CONTROLS
SO THAT'S THAT
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING YEAH
YEAH
SO WHEN YOU BUY YOUR REMOTE YOU CAN BUY
VARIOUS COVERINGS
PERSONALISE YOUR REMOTE
MM-HMM
DUNNO
SPONGY
Y PROBABLY NOT YEAH
MM
NO
HMM
MM
LIKE A COVERING
YEAH
THE WE CAN HAVE THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ON THE SPONGY PARTS SO THEY CAN REMOVE IT
MM
MM
BRIGHT CITRUS COLOURS YEAH
OH YEAH
YELLOW AND GREY
I THINK HAVING A SHAPE COULD BE A LITTLE RIDICULOUS LIKE
WELL WE KINDA DO YEAH
AND IF IT'S YELLOW
GREY BUTTONS YEAH
MM
OH
NICE
COULD LOOK LIKE A FRUIT BOWL
'KAY
SO IS THE TWO PIECE IDEA OUT
OR HAVE WE NOT DECIDED
OH RIGHT OKAY
MM
MM
MM
MM
WELL WHAT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID LIKE PUTTING THE
FINGER GRIPS JUST ON TOP OF THE PLASTIC
YEAH
SO THEN FOR THE SCROLL ARE WE GOING FOR THE IPOD TYPE
YEAH
OKAY
YEP
SOON AS I
GET THIS
OKAY
THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
UM I'LL GO AHEAD AND GO THROUGH THE MINUTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING
UH AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
UM THEN WE WILL UM DO AN EVALUATION
UH OR WE'LL SEE WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE UNDER THE CRITERIA FOR THE EVALUATION
THEN WE'LL GO THROUGH THE FINANCE AND SEE IF WE FALL WITHIN THE BUDGET
UM THEN WE'LL DO THE EVALUATION AND THEN WE CAN FINISH UP AFTER THAT WITH UM ANY CHANGES THAT WE'LL NEED TO MAKE
OR HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL FALL RIGHT IN LINE
UM LET'S SEE MINUTES FROM THE LAST MEETING
UM WE LOOKED AT UH THE THE TRENDS
WE HAD UH THE FASHION TRENDS THAT PEOPLE WANT A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
IT WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS ANYTHING ELSE
UM THEY LIKED FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IN THE NEW STYLES
UM AND A SPONGY FEEL
SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO INCORPORATE THOSE INTO OUR PROTOTYPE
UM THEY WANTED LIMITED BUTTONS AND SIMPLICITY
UM THEN WE LOOKED AT THE UH THE METHOD FOR COMING UP WITH OUR OWN REMOTE
UM LOOKING AT OTHER OTHER DEVICES
UM THE IPOD WE REALLY LIKED THE LOOK OF THAT
UM WE ALSO HAD UH THE KID'S REMOTE FOR A SIMPLE IDEA
UM A TWO PART REMOTE WHICH WAS WHAT WERE WERE ORIGINALLY LOOKING AT
UH AND THEN UM THERE WAS TALK OF SPEE UH SPEECH RECOGNITION UM BECOMING MORE UH PREDOMINANT AND EASIER TO USE
BUT I THINK WE'VE STILL DECIDED NOT TO GO WITH THAT
THEN WE LOOKED AT THE COMPONENTS UM
THE MATERIALS FOR THE CASE THE DIFFERENT ENERGY SOURCES THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHIPS
UM AND MADE A DECISION ON WHAT WE WERE GOING TO USE TO MAKE OUR REMOTE
UM AND BASICALLY
HOW WHAT WERE MAKING FOR THE PROTOTYPE
SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT AT THAT AND LET YOU GUYS TAKE OVER
THE PROTOTYPE YEAH
DO YOU NEED A THIS
OKAY
VERY NICE
MM-HMM
WHAT BUT WHAT'S THAT BUTTON
UH 'KAY
'KAY
WOULD YOU LIKE TO UH
WELL DONE
WELL LUCKILY WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT
OR NOT LUCKILY
UM DO YOU HAVE A MARKETING PRESENTATION FOR US
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE
SO IF THEY THINK THAT WHAT IS OUT THERE IS UGLY THEN YES I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY MOST DEFINITELY
IT'S BRIGHT
IT STILL HAS YOUR TRADITIONAL BLACK
YEP NOT ANGULAR
MM
YEP
YEAH SOMETHING MORE MODERN TO GO A A MODERN COLOUR TO GO WITH THE MODERN FORM
YEAH
I WOULD SAY
FOUR
VERY NON COMMITTAL FOUR
YEAH
MM-HMM
S SCROLLING THROUGH AND SELECTING A FEW
I THINK THAT'S A ONE
SO IF WE INCORPORATE SPEECH RECOGNITION INTO IT THEN IT COULD
AND IT IS QUITE BRIGHT AND
UH
YEAH
BUT IF WE DO GO WITH THE WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN IT THEN OUR SCALE GOES UP QUITE A BIT I THINK
PROBABLY TWO
YOU KNOW
IF WE ELIMINATE THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE THAT IT'S NOT GONNA BE LOST THEN
I'D SAY TWO
WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WHICH OF COURSE MAY
BE CHANGED DEPENDING ON BUDGET
WHICH WHICH MAY BE CHEAPER THAN SPEECH RECOGNITION IF IT WERE JUST A
SOME SORT OF PROXIMITY
PRAY THAT YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY LOSE THAT PIECE
OKAY
TWO
IT'S
BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF YELLOW THERE'S NOT A LOTTA YELLOW
COURSE THAT WASN'T REALLY WE WERE KINDA FORCED TO TAKE THAT COLOUR
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ARE THAT INNOVATIVE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
IF WE ADDED THE SCREAMING FACTOR THEN WE GO UP
UM I WOULD SAY WE'RE PROBABLY AT FOUR
WE HAVE SOME SPONGY YEAH
NO
YEAH
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GOT WHAT THESE PARTS ARE THE GRIPS AND PERHAPS THE BACK SIDE THE BOTTOM THE UNDERNEATH ON THE BACK
PROBABLY A FOUR AT MOST
POSSIBLY EVEN A FIVE
IF YOUR FASHION IS B IS CARMEN MIRANDA YOU BETCHA
IT'S TRUE
SEVEN IS
TWO POINT
TWO POINT FOUR
SOMETHING
AND WHAT WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE CRITERIA
IS THERE LIKE A SCALE THAT WE HAVE TO HIT
ALRIGHT THEN
OKAY
WELL LET'S SEE
NOW WE GET TO DO THE BUDGET NUMBERS
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE GONNA HAVE A BUDGET
BUT WE DO
OKAY
SO I HAVE HERE AN
YEAH
WE WANT A FIFTY PERCENT PROFIT ON THIS
OH YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THAT VERY WELL
TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS IS WHAT SUPPOSED TO COST US
OKAY SO
WELL LET'S SEE
THE F THE
WONDER IF I CAN MAKE THIS
WHAT THE
OH IT WON'T LET ME DO THAT
OKAY
ALRIGHT SO AT TOP I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS CAN READ THAT OR NOT
I CAN'T 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY GLASSES ON BUT SO WE'VE GOT THE ENERGY SOURCE
THERE'S UH FOUR FIVE SIX CATEGORIES
WE HAVE ENERGY SOURCE ELECTRONICS CASE
THEN WE HAVE CASE MATERIAL SUPPLEMENTS INTERFACE TYPE AND THEN BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
OKAY SO
UH FIRST OF ALL ENERGY SOURCE WE PICKED BATTERY
UM AND HOW MANY BATTERIES DO WE THINK THIS WILL PROBABLY TAKE
PROBABLY
SOME E EITHER TWO OR FOUR
TWO
LIKE IT
EXCELLENT
THIS IS CONSUMERISM
ALRIGHT SO FOR THE ELECTRONICS OUR CHOICES ARE SIMPL SIMPLE CHIP ON PRINT REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER
'KAY WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE
'KAY THEN THE CASE IS A
PROBABLY IT'S DOUBLE CURVED
CASE MATERIALS ARE PLASTIC
UM I GUESS IT'S TWO SINCE ONE FOR THE TOP ONE FOR THE BOTTOM
IS THAT RIGHT OR IS IT JUST ONE
MAYBE IT'S ONE BECAUSE OF THE
'KAY
I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER 'CAUSE THE PRICE ON THAT ONE IS ZERO WHICH IS NICE
SPECIAL COLOUR
INTERFACE TYPE
WE HAVE PUSHBUTTON SCROLL WHEEL INTERFACE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSHBUTTON AND AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
AND THEN IS IT THE INTEGRATED OR IS IT
YEAH
'KAY
BUTTON SUPPLEMENT
SPECIAL COLOUR
UM SPECIAL FORM
SPECIAL MATERIAL
OR TITANIUM
THEY COST US ALL THE SAME
WELL WE ONLY HAVE ONE BUTTON SO REALLY WE SHOULDN'T BE CHARGED WE SHOULDN'T BE CHARGED ANYTHING FOR THE THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
UM
OKAY
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THAT ONE BLANK BECAUSE WE RUN ON A L. C. D. AND SCROLL
SO OUR TOTAL IS FIFTEEN POINT FIVE
WHICH I BELIEVE IS
BY THREE EUROS OVER
SO THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN UM A BANANA SHAPED REMOTE IS ONE THAT YOU SHAKE
YEAH 'CAUSE THE
WELL 'CAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE BOTH RIGHT
MM-HMM
SO WE MAY NOT NEED THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
WELL THERE WE GO
TWELVE POINT FIVE
OKAY
SO WE JUST REMOVE OUR
SCREEN HERE
BESIDES LOOK AT WHAT THE L. C. D. DOES TO OUR LOVELY REMOTE
BACK TO THE DESIGN ROOM BOYS
OKAY SO THE COSTS UNDER TWELVE POINT FIVE EURO
WAS NO
WE REDESIGNED IT
NOW IT'S YES
NEXT SLIDE
PROJECT EVALUATION
UH PROJECT PROCESS SATISFACTION WITH FOR EXAMPLE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY LEADERSHIP TEAMWORK MEANS NEW IDEAS FOUND
UM
SO
I GUESS THAT
LET'S SEE HERE
I THINK THAT PERHAPS THE PROJECT EVALUATION'S JUST SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLETED BY ME
BUT
I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS
UH H WHAT DID YOU THINK OF OUR PROJECT PROCESS
GOOD
YEAH I THINK
WE ST WE STARTED OFF A LITTLE LITTLE WEAK
OUR LEADERSHIP WAS QUITE WEAK IN THE BEGINNING
UM UM
BUT AS THE DAY WENT ALONG WE HAD MORE IDEA OF WHAT WE WERE DOING
UM ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
THERE WAS THAT
UM I
THINK WE TRIED A LOTTA DIFFERENT THINGS AND UM
I THINK IT WAS UM INTERESTING AS YOU GUYS BROUGHT UP MORE UM INFORMATION AND STUDIES THAT WE WERE RIGHT ON WITH A LOT OF THOSE THINGS
UM YOU GUYS WORKED TOGETHER WELL AS A TEAM
AND UM THE MEANS
WHICH WAS THE WHITEBOARD AND THE PENS
I HAD SOME PROBLEM WITH THE PEN I THINK BUT MINUS YOUR P
WELL
HAVE A WE HAVE A LIST OF EMPLOYEES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE FIRED
OKAY
N NEW IDEAS FOUND
UM
YES FOR THE REMOTE
MAYBE NO NOT F FOR
TECHNOLOGY
ALRIGHT
CLOSING
COSTS ARE WITHIN THE BUDGET
PROJECT IS EVALUATED
UM COMPLETE THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE AND MEETING SUMMARY
THAT'S IT
AND I STILL HAVE TO DO MY MINUTES FOR THE LAST MEETING
ACTUALLY
UM SO THERE WILL PROBABLY BE ANOTHER
QUESTIONNAIRE COMING UP
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK WITH THE MAIN BOSS WHETHER WE CAN WHAT GOES ON AFTER THAT
BUT THAT'S THE END OF OUR MEETING
CAN TRY TO PLUG THAT IN THERE BUT
RIGHT
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THERE
THAT'S PLASTIC
PLASTIC COVERED WITH RUBBER
WE MIGHT
UH ADD SOME MORE UNDERNEATH HERE
MAYBE GIVE IT GIVE IT A FORM
I MEAN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HOLD IT LIKE THAT BUT UM JUST IF YOU GRAB IT
TAKE IT FROM SOMEWHERE SO YEAH YOU HAVE SOME RUB YEAH
EXACTLY USE BOTH
MIGHT AS WELL THINK ABOUT
TH THINK ABOUT THE BUTTON AS WELL
LIKE EITHER PUT EITHER ONE ONE ON EITHER SIDE OR
NOT DO IT AT ALL
IT'S A QUICK ON OFF BUTTON
THAT'S UM
YEAH I THINK IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIDDLE WITH THAT
RIGHT
UM THAT'S NOT UM I'D SAY A BIT SMALLER WOULD PROBABLY BE NICE
YOU WANNA PLAY WITH THAT OVER THERE
THERE YOU GO
RIGHT
I'D SAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE ERGONOMICS THE FORM AND STUFF YES THAT'S DEFINITELY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOUR AVERAGE
HOWEVER THE COLOUR WE DON'T HAVE A SAY IN THAT
THAT HAS BEEN THAT HAS BEEN DICTATED PRETTY MUCH BY THE COMPANY
SO UH TO ANSWER THAT HONESTLY I WOULD RATHER SAY LIKE UH
WE HAVE NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY WITH THE UGLY REMOTE BECAUSE THE COLOUR IS UGLY DEFINITELY
'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THAT
I MEAN I MUCH PREFER SOMETHING LIKE BRUSHED CHROME WITH THAT FORM
BUT
RIGHT
RIGHT
IT'S DIFFERENT
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR UH
THREE FEET HUGE L. C. D. DIS DISPLAY IN YOUR LIVING ROOM THAT'S HANGING FROM THE WALL TO BE CONTROLLED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S VERY INTUITIVE I THINK YEAH
S GIVE IT A ONE
RIGHT
RIGHT
SO THAT'S A ONE
SOMETHING THAT BIG AND THAT YELLOW YOU JUST DON'T LOSE ANYMORE
OOPS
HMM
WELL WHAT
S
MM
OH YEAH
YOU PROBABLY
MM
Y YOU COULD ADD AN EXTRA FEATURE ACTUALLY
WHICH MAKES THIS THING
RAISE HELL WHEN YOU REMOVE IT TOO FAR FROM THE TELEVISION
WE COULD ADD THAT BUT THAT'S NOTHING WE HAVE THOUGHT OF SO FAR
YES
IT'S IT'S
UM THE IT'S BASED ON THIS ANTI ANTI THEFT TECHNOLOGY FOR SUITCASES AND STUFF WHERE YOU HAVE ONE PIECE THAT'S ATTACHED TO YOUR LUGGAGE ANOTHER PIECE THAT STARTS BEEPING
THAT CAN'T COST MUCH
SO THAT CAN ALSO EASILY BE INTEGRATED BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO TO HIDE
SO YOU HAVE ONE PIECE YOU HAVE TO GLUE SOMEWHERE BEHIND YOUR STICK IT BEHIND YOUR T. V. AND THE OTHER
RIGHT
THAT'D BE TOUGH THEN
WELL ALSO YOUR REMOTE WOULD UH ALARM YOU IF SOMEBODY STOLE YOU T YOUR TELEVISION YEAH
RAN OFF WITH IT WITHOUT TAKING THE BEAUTIFUL REMOTE CONTROL
LET'S ADD ONE OF THOSE FEATURES AND SAY YES
TWO
UH
IT'S ALL JUST
IT'S ALL JUST STOLEN TECHNOLOGY WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH NOT REALLY
RIGHT
YEAH WELL YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF SORT OF
IT'S NOT A ONE THOUGH
ONE WOULD BE THE WHOLE THING
TO FOLD AND STUFF
YEAH
SO THAT'S A FOUR AT MOST
Y YES
MORE
WELL THE RECENT FASHION IS RATHER DISPLAYED IN THE IN THE L. C. D. AND THE WAY YOU OPERATE IT THAN THE FORM AND THE COLOUR BUT IT DEFINITELY IS
I'M IMPRESSED
I CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT A CALCULATOR
FIFTY PERCENT YOU'RE KIDDING
P
IT'S TOO MUCH
UM
UH
BATTERY
TWO
AT FOUR IT'S GONNA BE TOO HEAVY SO THAT THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM
PEOPLE CAN CHANGE IT EVERY MONTH
THEY WON'T KNOW UNTIL AFTER THEY BOUGHT IT
THAT'S THE ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT YEAH
DOUBLE CURVED YES
PLASTIC
N NO
NO THAT'S JUST ONE
IT'S JUST ONE MO SINGLE MOULD WE CAN DO THAT
EXACTLY RIGHT
THAT'S NOT A SPECIAL COLOUR
IT'S A SPECIALLY UGLY COLOUR BUT IT'S NOT SPECIAL
S
YES UNFORTUNATELY
WE COULD OF COURSE MAKE THE BUTTONS WOOD
SAY MAHOGANY OR SO
MM-HMM OR TITANIUM
UH JUST
YEAH THAT'S TOO MUCH
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
SO WE'LL GO FOR THE HAND DYNAMO HUH
I MEAN LET'S LET'S FACE IT IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE SOFTWARE ON THE ON THE TELEVISION
YOU CAN HAVE THE THE INFORMATION THAT THIS THING TRANSMITS BE BEING DISPLAYED ON THE ON THE SCREEN
SO S YEAH LET'S TAKE AWAY THE
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
WE MAY NOT NEED IT
THERE YOU GO
PERFECT
OKAY THE
SO WE CAN JUST
TAKE AWAY A HECK OF A LOT OF THE THERE YOU GO
CENTRAL
OH THAT'S JUST YEAH
THERE YOU GO
OOPS
THERE YOU GO
ONE MORE CRITERIA
FAIR ENOUGH
GREAT
YEAH
JUST HALF A DAY YOU HAVE A REMOTE
THERE YOU GO
SUPER SUPER
WELL THAT'S NOT MY FAULT
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE I WORK FOR UH THAT WORK FOR ME UH THEY'VE JUST YOU KNOW
HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL BELIEVE ME
YES YES
THE PROTOTYPE DISCUSSION
NO
THERE IS OUR REMO THE BANANA
UM YEAH BASICALLY WE WE ST WENT WITH THE COLOUR YELLOW
UM WORKING ON THE PRINCIPLE OF A FRUIT WHICH WAS MENTIONED IT'S BASICALLY DESIGNED AROUND A BANANA
UM BUT IT WOULD BE HELD IN SUCH A FASHION WHERE IT IS OBVIOUSLY IT WOULDN'T BE THAT FLOPPY 'CAUSE THIS WOULD BE HARD PLASTIC
THESE WOULD BE LIKE THE RUBBER THE RUBBER GRIPS
SO THAT'S SO THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY HELP WITH GRIP OR LIKE THE ERGONOMICS OF IT
UM BUT ALL THE CONTROLLING WOULD BE DONE WITH THIS SCROLL WHEEL
YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION A LITTLE BIT
AND THIS HERE REPRESENTS THE SCREEN WHERE YOU WHERE YOU'D GO THROUGH
AND THE THE SIMPLEST FUNCTIONS WOULD BE UM ALMOST IDENTICAL TO AN IPOD WHERE THAT ONE WAY CH THROUGH CHANNELS THAT WAY TH OTHER WAY THROUGH CHANNELS
VOLUME UP AND DOWN
AND THEN TO ACCESS THE MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS YOU'D YOU SORTA GO YOU PRESS THAT AND GO THROUGH THE MENUS
IT'S THAT THAT SIMPLE
THAT JUST REPRESENTS THE INFRARED UH BEAM
THAT'S A SIMPLE ON AND OFF SWITCH
UM I DON'T KNOW WE COULD USE THE VOICE
T THAT BLUE BITS SHOULD BE YELLOW D THAT THAT'D BE WHERE THE BATTERIES WOULD BE I SUPPOSE
AND UM THAT'S ABOUT IT
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS YOU WE COULD MAKE IT REALLY
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD
YEAH
DOESN'T MAKE MUCH MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE
YOU COULD WORK LEFT HANDED OR RIGHT HANDED I SUPPOSE
T THE ACTUAL THING MIGHT BE SMALLER
YEAH
JUST THE ON AND OFF
YEAH
IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S FLIMSY 'CAUSE IT'S MADE OUT OF HEAVY PLAY DOH BUT
AND WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD FALL INTO THE COST EVERYTHING I SUPPOSE
WITH THE SCROLL AND THE L. C. D.
YEAH
I WOULD
IT'S BRIGHT
IT'S
IT'S CURVED
IT'S NOT THERE'S NO SHARP
ANGLES TO IT
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK THAT WAS THE MAIN AIM ONE OF THE MAIN AIMS THAT WE HAD
UH YEAH
'CAUSE WE'VE WE'VE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO BASICALLY FOUR CONTROLS MOST COMMON WHICH ARE CHANNEL AND VOLUME
AND THEN THE OTHER ONES ARE JUST A MATTER OF JUST GOING JUST SCROLLING FURTHER
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S BRIGHT YELLOW
BRIGHT YELLOW'S HARD TO LOSE
BUT UM IF WE WERE TO IF WE WERE THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
THAT WE COULD MAYBE JUST USE THAT SOLELY FOR THE THE FINDING THING
THAT WAS WHAT WE'D WE'D MENTIONED
JUST JUST TO USE TO FIND IT WHEN IT WAS LOST
BUT LIKE I SAID LIKE I DON'T THINK YOU'D LOSE SOMETHING SO YELLOW SO EASILY
AND IT'S NOT GONNA FALL LIKE A RECTANGLE WOULD SLIP DOWN BEHIND THINGS
THAT'S GONNA BE A DIFFICULT SHAPE TO
YEAH
MAYBE IN THE MIDDLE AGAIN THREE OR FOUR OR SOMETHING
I MEAN YOU KNOW LOO LOSING THINGS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN LOSE I MEAN A MILLION WAYS
YOU CAN PICK IT UP AND WALK AWAY WITH IT AND THEN YOU'VE LOST IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH TRUE
BUT I MEAN D JUST THOSE WHISTLING CLAPPING KEY RINGS YOU HAVE
THEY'RE CHEAP
SO IT CAN'T BE THAT
EXPENSIVE
YEAH
YEAH
STICK IT ON THE T. V.
YEAH
TWO
I'D SAY SO
UH DON'T GET MANY MO REMOTE CONTROLS WITH
SCREENS ON
YEAH IT'S STOLEN TECHNOLOGY
BUT WE HAVE
FA
'CAUSE IT'S STOLEN
NO MAYBE NOT
YEAH AS MUCH AS AS NEEDED I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ON THE
YEAH
BE WHAT WE WERE TOLD AND THEY'D SAY YEAH DEFINITELY
IS THAT SOME LONG DIVISION
NO
JUST I'M SURE THERE'S A
NO I CAN'T DO LONG VERY IMPRESSIVE
YEAH
YEAH SO
YOU'D BEEN GOING A LONG TIME DIVIDING THAT
IT'S TWO POINT FOUR TWO EIGHT FIVE SE IT JUST KEEPS GOING ON
TWO POINT FOUR TWO BASICALLY
CHARGE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED QUID FOR IT
WE'RE ADVANCED CHIP ARE WE
YEAH YEAH
S
THAT'S
YEAH
AND THEN
I'D SAY THE INTEGRATED
MM
REMOTE CONTROL
NO THAT'S GETTING A BIT
TINY
YEAH
I'D IGNORE THAT
IF IT W
WHAT IF WE COMPLETELY TOOK OUT THE THE ONE SINGLE BUTTON WE'VE GOT ON
AND JUST HAD A SCROLL WHEEL INTERFACE
AND THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
I SUPPOSE THE L. C. D. C. DISPLAY'S THE ONE THAT'S PUSHING IT UP A BIT THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU COULD MAYBE TAKE OUT THE L. C. D. DIS DISPLAY EVEN IF IT IF IT COMES UP ON THE COMPUTER ITSEL ON THE T. V. ITSELF
UH THAT IS POSSIBLE YEAH
THERE WE GO
SCREEN
MAKE IT A BIGGER DIAL
EASIER TO USE
EVEN EASIER TO USE THEN
THAT WAS JUST WE RAN OUT OF YELLOW
THERE YOU GO
EVEN SIMPLER
YEAH
FOR ALL THOSE FRUIT LOVERS OUT THERE
YEAH
I THINK WE DID YEAH I THINK WE DID QUITE WELL
UM
YEAH
RIGHT FROM THE START OF THE DAY
WE SORT OF KNEW WHERE WE WERE GOING STRAIGHT AWAY I THOUGHT
YEAH
WE'VE USED THE WHITEBOARD
TECHNOLOGY USED
EXCELLENT
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE
KIND OF A BANANA
I DO
OKAY
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HELP ME DO AN EVALUATION OF THE CRITERIA
UM
OKAY
SO FIRST I'LL JUST DISCUSS SOME OF THE CRITERIA THAT I FOUND
JUST BASED ON THE PAST TREND REPORTS THAT I WAS LOOKING AT EARLIER
AND THEN WE'LL DO A GROUP EVALUATION OF THE PROTOTYPE
AND THEN WE WILL CALCULATE THE AVERAGE SCORE TO SEE HOW WE DID
UM SO THE CRITERIA WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT ARE THE COMPLAINTS UM THAT WE HEARD FROM THE USERS WHO WERE INTERVIEWED EARLIER
SO
WE'RE GONNA BE DOING IT BASED ON A SEVEN POINT SCALE
AND ONE IS GOING TO MEAN TRUE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT
WITH SEVEN BEING FALSE WE DID NOT ACHIEVE THAT
OKAY
SO FOR THE FIRST ONE WE NEED TO DECIDE DID WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF THE USERS WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT AN UGLY REMOTE
MM
MM
YEAH I THINK THE COLOURS DETRACT A LITTLE BIT
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
UM OKAY SO DO YOU THINK SINCE WE
THIS WAS A A SIGN CRITERIA DO YOU THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT IT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE THEN
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THREE
FOUR
FIVE
FOUR IS FAIR
OKAY
OKAY THE SECOND ONE
DID WE MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR NEW USERS
ONE 'KAY
OKAY
UM DO THE CONTROLS NOW MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USERS
I'D SAY THAT
SO ONE
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY UM THE FOURTH ONE
HOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF A REMOTE BEING EASILY LOST
ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINTS
WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE IT
OKAY
THAT'S TRUE
MM
ANNOYING ALARM OR SOMETHING
YEAH
SO
ARE WE ADDING ONE OF THESE
TWO FEATURES
GONNA SAY OKAY
SO WE'RE BACK TO A ONE
OR A TWO
TWO 'KAY
OKAY
ARE WE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
FROM IPOD YEAH
BUT FOR REMOTES YEAH
TWO
THREE
BUT HOW MANY REMOTES DO YOU SEE LIKE THIS
NOT SO MANY
REALLY
OKAY
THAT'S GONNA HURT US
OKAY
UM SPONGY MATERIAL
'KAY
AND LASTLY DID WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
I'D SAY WE DID
'KAY
ALRIGHT
NOW WE JUST GOTTA CALCULATE
SIX EIGHT TWELVE SIXTEEN
SEVENTEEN DIVIDED BY S
EIGHT
WELL I HAVEN'T DONE MATH IN YEARS
WHAT TWO I DUNNO
OKAY WE'LL SAY TWO POINT FOUR TWO
RIGHT
HOW DOES THAT LOOK
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
OH NO
THEY JUST TOLD ME TO
PICK MY OWN CRITERIA AND HAVE YOU GUYS EVALUATE IT BASICALLY
SO THAT'S THAT
OH MY GOD
OKAY
YEAH WE'LL GO WITH THAT
NOT TOO SHABBY
RIGHT
OH
BRIGHT YELLOW
IT'D LOOK REALLY LOVELY
YEAH
LEAVE IT BLANK
PERFECT
WHAT'S THE BLUE PART
OH THAT'S THE BATTERIES
OKAY
LOOKS MORE LIKE A BANANA
TRYING TO FILL IN SOME TIME THERE
GOOD TEAMWORK
MINUS YOUR POWERPOINT FIASCO
NO I KNOW
I'M YEAH
INCOM
MM
KINDA
WE MIGHT HAVE A WHILE THOUGH
