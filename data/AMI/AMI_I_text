UH I GUESS I START WITH MY PRESENTATION
WE HAD TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE WORKING ON THIS
SO WE'LL SHOW YOU TWO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS
FEEL FREE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OBVIOUSLY
UM THE FIRST ONE WAS DONE BY MYSELF BRUNO MARIANNE AND NIKOS
AND THE RATIONALE THAT WE HAVE I'LL SHOW YOU THE LAYOUT IN A SECOND WAS THAT FULL PROFESSORS WOULD GET PRIVATE OFFICES
ADMINISTRATION IS CLOSE TO THE PROFESSORS OFFICES SO IT'S EASIER FOR THE SECRETARY TO SPEAK TO EVERYONE
THE FAX IS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE SINCE IT'S MOSTLY USED BY GISELLA WHO'S THE SECRETARY
FOR NOISE REDUCTION PURPOSES WE'VE MOVED EVERYONE WHO HAS OFFICE HOURS TOGETHER AND WE'VE ALSO PUT THE NETWORK PRINTER AND THE PHOTOCOPIER IN THE HALL
UM SO I'LL JUST SHOW YOU HOW THAT WORKS
BASICALLY YOU CAN SEE GISELLA SORT OF THERE IN THE MIDDLE WITH THE FAX MACHINE AND MAGGIE AND SUSAN
WHO ARE THE TWO FULL PROFESSORS IN OUR DEPARTMENT HAVE THE PRIVATE OFFICES
AND THE PHOTOCOPIER AND THE PRINTER ARE SORT OF IN THE HALL ON THE SIDE THERE ACROSS FROM MAILBOXES
UM JUST TO GO BACK MOST PEOPLE ARE GROUPED IN PROJECTS
AND WE HAVE TWO FIFTY PER CENT PEOPLE WHO ARE HALF TIME IN GENEVA HALF TIME AT THE E. P. F. L. IN LAUSANNE
AND THEY M THEM WE'VE PUT IN THREE PERSON OFFICES SO THAT IN THE THREE PERSON OFFICES IT'S NOT CONSTANTLY THREE PEOPLE
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF GIVE THERE
AND THE READING ROOM OR THE LOUNGE AS SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THAT WE HAVE IS IN A CENTRAL POSITION
SO BASICALLY WE'VE GOT ANDRE AND NANCY AT THE TOP
UM THEY DON'T ACTU THEY WILL BE STARTING A NEW PROJECT TOGETHER IF UM IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
LIKE I SAID SUSAN AND MAGGIE IN THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICES
NIKOS AND YALINA WHO WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT AT THE BOTTOM
THE READING ROOM IS IN THE MIDDLE
UM MARIANNE AND BRUNO ARE AT THE BOTTOM
UM AS WELL MARIANNE WORKS CLOSELY WITH PIERRETTE AND THE OTHER MARIANNE
WE HAVE TWO MARIANNES IN OUR DEPARTMENT
AND DAVID IS A HALF TIME
SO AS I SAID THE HALF TIMES ARE IN THE THREE PERSON OFFICES
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE MARIA MARTIN AND MYSELF WHO ALL WORK ON THE SAME PROJECT
AND MARTIN IS FIFTY PER CENT
UM GISELLA WE'VE GIVEN HER TWO PERSON OFFICE FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS BECAUSE THERE'S A SPARE PLACE THERE
SO IF WE WANT TO PUT A STAGIEUR OR SOMEONE WHO JUST COMES IN FOR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
WE FIGURED IT WAS OKAY IF THEY WERE IN THE ADMIN OFFICE WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT NOISY BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY THERE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
UM AND AGAIN THE PROXIMITY TO THE OTHER OFFICES
UM SO I GUESS THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR OUR PROPOSAL
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ANDRE TO GO THROUGH HIS FIRST OR IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME
SHE'S IT'S DO YOU WANNA EXPLAIN HOW IT IT WORKS OR
MARTIN IS FIFTY PER CENT
PIERRETTE THERE'S TWO SORT OF STATUTES OF PROFESSOR
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY WHERE THERE'S
YEAH
THERE'S A PROFESSEUR D'ECOLE AND THE
BUT THE IDEA IS MAGGIE AND SUSAN ARE SORT OF THE SENIOR
UM PROFESSORS ON STAFF SO THEY GOT THE THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICES
UM THE DEPARTMENT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE GROWING BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ONLY WORK PART TIME
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING P. H. D. S OR MASTER STUDENTS WHO WON'T NECESSARILY BE THERE FOR A LARGER EXTENT OF TIME
SO FOR EXAMPLE YALINA AND THE FINNISH MARIANNE ARE MASTER STUDENTS FOR RIGHT NOW
SO WHETHER THEY DECIDE TO STAY AND DO A P. H. D. WE'RE NOT SURE YET
UM NIKOS IS WORKING UM AS A RESEARCHER
SO FOR HIM IT'S THE SAME THING
THERE'S I THINK THE ONLY CONSTANT PEOPLE ARE SUSAN MAGGIE ANDRE
UM GISELLA PIERRETTE UM AND ALL THE REST ARE EITHER P. H. D. STUDENTS OR MASTER STUDENTS
AND AGAIN MARTIN AND DAVID ARE HALF TIME WITH THE E. P. F. L. SO
THAT'S PROJECT DEPENDENT AS WELL
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN AS MUCH SPACE AS WE WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE
UM SUSAN WANTED A PRIVATE OFFICE SHE HAS A PREFERENCE FOR PRIVATE OFFICES
OTHER THAN THAT NO ONE REALLY HAD ANY TIGHT CONSTRAINTS FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD
NO ONE'S EXPLICITLY SAID THAT THEY NEEDED TO AVOID ANYONE ELSE
UM
YEAH YEAH YEAH
NO THEY WERE FINE WITH IT SO
AND THEY'RE BOTH NICE VIEWS
YEAH THEY'RE WINDOWS YEAH
OR SORRY THE THICK LINES ARE WINDOWS ACTUALLY
WE HAVE FAIRLY BIG WINDOWS IN THE ROOM YEAH
SO THERE'S LOTS OF LIGHT COMING IN
AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR PUTTING THE READING ROOM WHERE IT WAS IS THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF LIGHT COMING IN
SO IF PEOPLE JUST GO SOMEWHERE TO SORT OF RELAX AND
HAVE A QUIET PLACE TO SIPS SIT THEY HAVE A LOT OF LIGHT AND
YEAH YEAH
YEAH WELL I MEAN IT DEPENDS IF YOU LIKE LOOKING OUT OVER THE OLD TOWN AND THE CATHEDRAL
THAT SORT OF GOES BOTH WAYS BUT YEAH WE'VE GOT TWO MOUNTAIN VIEWS
SORT OF ON THAT SIDE THAT SIDE AND THEN THE LAST PART LOOKS ON THE OLD TOWN
BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE SIXTH FLOOR YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE EVERYTHING 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK BUILDINGS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN WAS IT SIX OR EIGHT FLOORS
YEAH
THE PURPLE THING IS THE MAILBOXES
AND THOSE ARE FIXED WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE
SO
UM R
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT
IF WE CAN GET STUFF LIKE THAT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT LIKE THEM
AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE PEOPLE THRE SHARING LIKE THREE PEOPLE IN A ROOM WITHOUT ANY PARTITIONS AND
IT'S A LITTLE BIT NOISY BUT PEOPLE SORT OF GET USED TO IT AND ADMITTEDLY IT'S MOSTLY ASSISTANTS THAT ARE STUCK IN ROOMS LIKE THAT
SO IT'S JUNIOR PEOPLE BUT
WELL DO YOU WANT TO DO YOUR PRESENTATION AND
OKAY
SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT REALISTICALLY WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT MANY VISITORS COMING IN
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS AND WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF STAGIEURS BUT THAT'S IT
NO FOR A PROFESSOR YEAH BUT
OH IN A WAY IF THAT'S YOUR ARGUMENTATION THEN PUT A VISITING PERSON WITH A SENIOR
RESEARCHER AT LEAST IF NOT A PROFESSOR RATHER THAN TWO STUDENTS
IF YOU'RE GONNA ARGUE THAT THE VISITORS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPORTANT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN SPACE
THEN PUT THEM WITH ANOTHER RESEARCHER RATHER THAN TWO STUDENTS
FAIRLY REGULARLY THERE'S AT LEAST ONE OR TWO PEOPLE IN THERE
I MEAN IT'S A YEAH
IT'S A FAIRLY NEW THING IN THE DEPARTMENT BUT IT'S BEING USED PRETTY REGULARLY OR SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTED
JUST SORT OF QUIET SPACE OUT OF YOUR OFFICE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE OFFICE FURNITURE
THE OFFICE CHAIRS IT SORT OF HAS COMFORTABLE SOFAS AND ARMCHAIRS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE YOU CAN JUST GO AND RELAX
AND OR IF YOU WANNA READ SOMETHING FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME IN A MORE COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT
AND BECAUSE WE DO A LOT OF READING AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT DOES GET USED FAIRLY OFTEN
WE SORT OF HAVE AN OPEN POLICY WHERE IF THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION THEN THAT'S FINE
BUT YOU CAN'T DISPLACE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THERE READING JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE A MINI MEETING OR WHATEVER
YEAH
YEAH THEY'RE
YEAH
WHICH IS SORT OF WHY IN OUR PROPOSAL WE HAD IT COMPLETELY AS A SEPARATE ROOM
SO IF YOU REALLY WANT PEACE AND QUIET YOU SHUT THE DOOR AND WHEN THE DOORS ARE SHUT
LIKE UNLESS SOMEONE'S MAKING NOISE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR IT REALLY IS FAIRLY QUIET
MM-HMM
MM
I MEAN SUPPOSE IF THE NEED REALLY ARISES AND IT COMES TO A POINT WHERE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE
THEN YOU CAN GET RID OF THE LOUNGE
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE FURNITURE EITHER DISTRIBUTE IT BETWEEN VARIOUS OFFICES OR PUT IT INTO STORAGE SOMEWHERE
NO NO NO
NO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IT STARTED OFF SORT OF AS A DISCUSSION AT THE COFFEE TABLE
WHERE PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING THAT SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON THEY JUST WANTED SOMEWHERE TO GO OFF AND
NO HAVE SOME QUIET TIME AND THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM
THERE ARE BOOKSHELVES IN THERE BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A LIBRARY 'CAUSE EVERYONE AT THE MOMENT
EVERYONE HAS A BOOKSHELF IN THEIR OFFICE AND WE JUST GO IN AND BORROW BOOKS FROM EVERYONE ELSE
IT'S MORE REALLY ABOUT HAVING A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO SIT UM WHERE IT'S NOT AN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE AN OFFICE
SO IT'S JUST
YEAH YEAH AND PEOPLE CAN COME W IN WITH THEIR STUFF OR LEAVE A NEWSPAPER OR A MAGAZINE LYING AROUND FOR OTHER PEOPLE
WE'VE GOT A BULLETIN BOARD WHERE YOU CAN PASTE UP ARTICLES THAT YOU THINK ARE B INTERESTING FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT
I D
WELL SHE SHARES AN OFFICE SO WHICH IS WHY WE WERE THINKING THAT IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM TO S KEEP HER WITH A SPARE PERSON
BECAUSE THAT'S THE W THE SITUATION IT IS RIGHT NOW
AND IF YOU'RE A STAGIEUR AND YOU'RE COMING AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY EXPECT TO HAVE A FULL BLOWN OFFICE IF YOU ARE ONLY THERE FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS
YEAH
GISELLA HAS A FIXED SCHEDULE FOR WHEN SHE'S THERE BUT DAVID AND MARTIN ARE SORT OF THEY F IT FLUCTUATES
LIKE THEY CAN'T SAY THAT THEY'LL BE THERE MONDAY TUESDAY AND HALF OF WEDNESDAY AND NOT THE REST OF THE TIME WHICH IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
I MEAN THEY CAN'T S SPECIFY WHEN EXACTLY THEY'LL BE THERE
SO OUR RATIONALE FOR PUTTING THEM IN A THREE PERSON ROOM IS IS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN THEY'RE THERE AND WHETHER THEY'RE THERE FOR CERTAIN HOURS OR NOT
IT'S JUST EITHER THERE'S TWO OR THREE PEOPLE IN THOSE ROOMS AND SOMETIMES THERE'S LESS SOMETIMES THERE'S MORE BECAUSE WE ALSO DON'T WORK FIXED HOURS
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WORK YOU KNOW NINE TO FIVE OR WHATEVER
EVERYONE SORT OF KEEPS THEIR OWN HOURS
YEAH
WE HAVE PIERRETTE AND MARIANNE IN THE SAME
YEAH
FOR VISITORS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK BECAUSE IT'S A FAIRLY NEW THING IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SAY AT THIS POINT
I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE LIKE IT NOW THAT IT'S THERE
THEY SORT OF SEE THE VALUE OF IT AND THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE IT WIPED OUT ENTIRELY DEFINITELY
YEAH
AND THAT'S THE DANGER IS
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
SURE
EITHER WAY
OKAY WELL SINCE THIS ONE'S UP KEEP THIS ONE IN
EASILY GO AHEAD
MM-HMM
DOUBLE ROOMS
MM 'KAY
PIERRETTE AND MARTIN
MM-HMM
HERE
OUT
THERE'S TWO MARIANNES ONE IS SWEDISH ONE IS FINNISH
SO WE JUST CALL THEM THE SWEDISH AND THE FINNISH
OOPS
NO BOTH START WITH S. BUT
UH IT WAS BRUNO RIGHT
YEAH
MM 'KAY
IN HERE
OKAY
WELL FOR M MARTIN IF YOU DIDN'T MIND WORKING WITH MARTIN WE CAN SWITCH NANCY AND MARTIN HERE
OOPS
YEAH
AH
WRONG KEYBOARD
SO WE CAN SAY THAT THIS IS SORT OF FOR BUT THEN AGAIN YOU GET THE MORE FORMAL VISITOR IN WITH A BUNCH OF STUDENTS IN A CROWDED ROOM
WELL YOU CAN SAY THAT THIS ONE IS FOR LET'S SAY STAGIEURS OR INTERNS
UM
YEAH
WELL YOU CAN MOVE MAGGIE AND BRUNO
INTO THIS ROOM
MOVE GISELLA MOVE THE OTHER SPARE PLACE TO THE BIG ROOM BUT THEN THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THERE
WE'RE NOT TERRIBLY NOISY I THINK IT'LL BE FINE
YEAH
AND I AM TOO IN COMMON WITH MARIA
AND WE WORK ON SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SCHEDULES TOO 'CAUSE MARIA AND I TEND TO WORK EARLIER AND NANCY TENDS TO WORK LATER
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
MM-HMM
YEAH
SURE
UM SO YOU WANT TO DO
THAT'S GONNA BACK FIRE ON ME
YEAH
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU EITHER GET SMALLER DESKS 'CAUSE THE ONES THAT WE HAVE NOW WON'T FIT
NO
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE TOO MUCH
WELL MARIA IS FULL TIME
SO JUST LIKE THAT
OKAY
I DON'T THINK SHE CARES
ACTU BRUNO DID MENTION THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN A ROOM WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE 'CAUSE HE DID THAT BEFORE AND HE DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT
SO MAYBE
I DON'T KNOW I CAN SWITCH WITH HIM AND WE CAN PUT HIM AND NANCY TOGETHER
I DON'T MIND IT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME
OKAY
YEAH
WELL THE GENDER BALANCING WE HAVE MORE WOMEN THAN MEN IN OUR DEPARTMENT ANYWAYS SO
NO
OKAY
DO YOU SEE ANY CONSTRAINTS FROM ANY ADMINISTRATIVE SIDES
GOOD QUESTION
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO BASICALLY WE'RE MOVING INTO A NEW SPACE BUT IT'S
ONLY MARGINALLY BETTER THAN THE OLD ONE
MM SURE YEAH WE CAN DO THAT
MM 'KAY
SURE
OKAY
SO I'LL SAVE THAT
YEAH
OKAY
THE FINAL COPY
I'LL CIRCULATE IT TO EVERYONE ALONG WITH THE NUMBERS THAT YOU GUYS WANTED TO SEE IN TERMS OF THE SPACE
OKAY
GREAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO YOU SA SO PIERRETTE IS A PROFESSOR BUT SHE'S ONLY SHE'S ONLY FIFTY PER CENT TIME
IS THAT WHY SHE'S IN A THREE PERSON OFFICE
UH-HUH
I SEE
MM
MM-HMM
AND WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT WHAT DO YOU FORESEE HAPPENING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS
LIKE BEYOND THIS M B BEYOND THIS CURRENT GROUP OF PEOPLE DO WE DO WE KNOW OF ANY CHANGES COMING
IS THE DEPARTMENT GROWING
OR IS IT IS IT GOING TO BE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE
YEAH
AND HAVE YOU HAVE YOU TALKED TO TH ANY OF THESE PEOPLE TO ASK THEM IF THEY HAVE ANY
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
OH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OF PEOPLE THEY NEEDED TO BE NEAR OR PEOPLE THEY WOULD NEEDED TO AVOID OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
BUT YOU'VE GIVEN PEOPLE CHANCE TO SAY THAT IF THEY REALLY NEEDED TO
OKAY GOOD
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT SAYS MOUNTAINS
IS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE VIEW
YEAH
SO IT'S THE BEST VIEW
YOU GAVE THE READING ROOM THE BEST VIEW
MM-HMM
OKAY
OH TWO MOUNTAIN VIEWS
OH AND THAT'S OLD TOWN
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
NO OKAY
WHAT'S THAT PURPLE THING THERE
OH OKAY
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
OKAY
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
UH UH
MM
IN THE LOUNGE YEAH
MM-HMM
SO IT'S NOT A PLACE FOR DISCUSSION
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S A QUIET PLACE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM I SEE
AND SO I THERE'S NO ARE YOU PLANNING SOME KIND OF PARTITION BETWEEN THE LOUNGE AND THE OFFICES OR AR HOW ARE YOU GONNA KEEP THOSE THINGS I THINK SHOULD ASK THE QUESTION TO YOU
HOW ARE YOU GONNA KEEP THEM SEPARATE
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
FAIRLY SEPARATE FUNCTIONS
BOOK CASES OR SOMETHING OR YEAH
HMM
BUT IT WON'T BE UH AN ACOUSTIC SEPARATION
SO IF IF THE THOSE ARE STUDENTS THERE
SO IF THEY'RE NOISY THAT COULD DISRUPT THE QUIET OF THE LOUNGE
UM
BUT
AS A SEPARATE ROOM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT YOU'VE ALSO PUT THE LOUNGE IN A A VERY K KIND OF A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA WHERE THE MAILBOXES ARE THE PRINTER AND THE RESTROOMS
SO THAT'S UM
THAT MAY ALSO THA THAT MAY BE GOOD FOR
MEETING PEOPLE AND BUMPING INTO PEOPLE BUT IT'S MAYBE AGAINST THE IDEA IF IT'S A VERY SUPPOSED TO BE AN ISOLATED QUIET SPOT
SO I D MM YOU KNOW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
WELL MAYBE IF IT IF IT HELPS US PACK MORE PEOPLE INTO THE OFFICES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRIVATE LOUNGE
MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING
SAVES US MONEY
BUT UH
UH YEAH I GUESS THAT'S LET'S SEE WHAT IS THAT
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
BUT YOU'RE SAYING IT DOES GET USED
SO YOU'VE IT'S IT'S NOT A COMPLETELY EXPERIMENTAL CONCEPT
YOUR YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS A LOUNGE AND IT GETS USED A LOT
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO CAN YOU JUST SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUR TWO PROPOSALS THE KEY DIFFERENCES
UH SH SHARED
YEAH THE SHARED LOUNGE THE THE ASSISTANTS WITH THEIR PROFESSORS
IN TWO CASES
YEAH
OH OKAY
SO THAT'S OKAY
YEAH
SO YEAH
T. V. AT THE LOUNGE THE ADMIN ROOM SEPARATE
NOT SHARED
MM-HMM
OKAY SO YOU BASICALLY ACHIEVE THAT BY GIVING LESS SPACE TO THE READING ROOM I THINK
YEAH
RIGHT
SO I GUESS WHAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS HOW IMPORTANT IS THE READING ROOM TO YOUR GROUP REALLY
IS IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S A VERY VALUED THING THAT HAS TO BE PROTECTED UM
OR IS IT OKAY TO L MAKE IT BE KIND OF THIS SPARE SPACE THAT GETS USED UP A LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU NEED WHEN YOU HAVE SOME EXTRA VISITORS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
I THINK THAT'S
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT I SUPPOSE ONCE IT IF IT GETS EATEN AWAY A LITTLE BIT AT ONE SOME POINT IT BECOMES UNUSEFUL AND THEN YEAH
SO IT
MM YEAH
MM-HMM
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SWEDISH UM
OH I SEE
OKAY
OKAY
OH
OKAY
JUST S. UH SO JUST TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE OKAY
I'VE HEARD OF THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PUT FOUR PEOPLE IN THAT OFFICE DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE PLANNING ON FOUR DESKS
YOU NEED SPACE FOR FOUR DESKS
YEAH
DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE
YEAH
MM RIGHT
MM-HMM
AND SO YOU CAN FIT THAT YOU THINK
MM-HMM
MM
NO
MM
YOU MEAN MAYBE YOU SHOULD BREAK THE WALL BETWEEN THE MEN'S ROOM AND THE WOMEN'S ROOM
SORRY
NO
MM-HMM
MM
MM
IS YOUR PERSON TO SQUARE METER RATIO WITHIN THE N UNIVERSITY NORMS
OVERALL
WE DON'T WE DON'T I MEAN
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING IN SEEING THIS LAVISH READING ROOM AND AND AND EVERYONE HAVING THEIR OWN OFFICE IF THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE HAVING IN THE OTHER PLACES
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT UM IF FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A SPARE READING ROOM LIKE WE WERE SAYING BEFORE
OVERALL YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS DOESN'T HAVE EXCESSIVE SPACE PER PERSON
MM-HMM
MM RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
MM BU
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
WELL
IT'S GOOD IN CASE I EVER HAVE TO DEFEND IT
YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD TO HAVE SOME NUMBERS IF YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOME NUMBERS UH
SOME
AND MAYBE UH RELATIVE TO SOME OTHER COMPARABLE DEPARTMENTS
THAT'S IT'S IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THAT
BUT IF YOU BOTH AGREE WITH THIS PLAN AND YOU THINK YOUR GROUP WILL BE HAPPY THEN UH FINE WITH ME
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK
YEAH
OKAY
ALRIGHT
WELL THANK YOU
NO PROBLEM
THANK YOU
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH ACTUALLY MARTIN IS FIFTY PER CENT TIME
YEAH
NO
OH BECAUSE YOU WOULD SAY THAT SHE'S AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OH OKAY
YEAH
BUT UM YEAH MAYBE THAT'S
YEAH THERE ARE FULL PROFESSORS AND ASSISTANT PROFESSORS IF YOU WANT
AND YEAH IT'S TRUE THAT SHE'S AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR BUT UH WELL
WE SEE MAYBE WE CAN MOVE A LITTLE BIT AROUND JUST TO GIVE HER UH
WELL ALSO AT LEAST MAYBE NOT A UH AN OFFICE ALONE BUT AT LEAST WITH JUST ONE PERSON NOT TWO
WE'LL SEE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH NO MOUNTAINS ARE JUST IN THE FAR SO THAT'S NOT
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM WELL UH I CAN THINK OF SOME REACTIONS FROM THE PEOPLE WI SO MAYBE I CAN WELL R
YEAH WELL TELL ME ABOUT SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS AND WELL FIRST OF ALL I MUST SAY THAT THERE ARE ALSO QUITE A LOT OF COMMON POINTS
SO UM IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO YEAH PLEASE
THANKS
PERFECT
SO UM YEAH ACTUALLY WE UM WELL BASICALLY THE THE GROUP WHO PRODUCED THIS UH PROPOSAL IS MADE BY SUSAN
MARTIN DAVID AND UH AND MYSELF
AND WE ALSO WELL SUSAN VOLUNTEERED TO ASK MAGGIE AND PIERRETTE ABOUT HOW THEY THEY FELT ABOUT SHARING OFFICES AND
SO AS YOU CAN SEE WELL UM SUSAN GETS OBVIOUSLY THE SAME OFFICE WHICH IS QUITE A GOOD THING
UM THEN THINGS STARTED MOVE A BIT
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M ALSO IN THE SAME POSITION
BUT THE MOST OBVIOUS CONSTRAINTS THAT UH WE WE FOUND HERE WAS THAT IT WAS PROBABLY VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE A LOUNGE UH JUST A LOUNGE IN ONE ROOM
BECAUSE IT WOULD BLOCK US TWO FULL WORKING PLACES
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S TRUE THAT THE GROUP I AGREE DECIDED TO TO HAD TO HAVE A LOUNGE
WE PROPOSE TO PUT THE LOUNGE UH IN THE ROOM AT THE THE UPPER SIDE ON ON THE RIGHT
UH SO LET TWO PEOPLE SHARE THIS WITH UH SORT OF A YEAH A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE A SOFA MAYBE AND UH AND SOME BOOKS
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A CALM PLACE
PEOPLE ARE NOT THERE TO TALK VERY LOUD BUT THEY CAN SIT AND RELAX AND UH STILL LOOK AT AT THE MOUNTAINS
UM ALSO SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCES I THINK MAYBE ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
UH THE OTHER ONE IS THE ADMIN OFFICE
SO IT'S GISELLA FIFTY PER CENT BECAUSE SHE'S ONLY HALF TIME AND UH THE FAX MACHINE
UM GISELLA ACTUALLY HAS A LOT OF PHONE CALLS TO MAKE AND UH IT'S TRUE THAT HER ACTIVITY IS QUITE NOISY WHEN SHE'S THERE
UM IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT SHE HAS QUITE A LOT OF FILES FOR MOST OF THE THE PROJECTS ACTUALLY THAT WE MANAGE
SO IT APPEARED AT LEAST TO WELL TO OUR GROUP
THAT EVEN IF SHE'S HERE ONLY HALF TIME
SHE SHOULD HAVE AN OFFICE BY HER OWN BECAUSE IT WOULD BE QUITE DISTURBING FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO TO WORK IN THE THE SAME OFFICE
UH GISELLA HAS HAS NO OBJECTION AGAINST SHARING THE OFFICE
WE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE FOR THE THE CALM OF THE THE PEOPLE
IT'S TRUE THAT THIS BLOCKS ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS BUT UH ON THE OTHER HAND
UH MAGGIE HAS NO OBJECTION UH SHARING AN OFFICE WITH HER ASSISTANT
AND THIS APPEARED TO BE TRUE ALSO OF PIERRETTE
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT PIERRETTE SHARING AN OFFICE WITH TWO PERSONS BUT AT LEAST NO PROBLEM IN PIERRETTE SHARING HER OFFICE WITH UH MARIANNE
THE THE SWEDISH ONE WHO IS SORT OF HER ASSISTANT
UM SO THIS IS WHY WE YEAH WE PUT MAGGIE WITH WITH BRUNO
AND THEN THE THIRD MAIN DIFFERENCE UH WOULD BE THE THE NUMBER OF VISITOR PLACES OR FREE PLACES
UH YOU NOTICE A NEW NAME IN THE ROOM UH AT THE CENTRE UPPER UPPER SIDE
SO THAT'S PAOLA
IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S SOMEONE COMING NEXT YEAR SUSAN REMINDED ME THIS UH OF THIS POINT AND I COULD NOT REALLY IGNORE IT
UH SO UM THAT SHE'S AN ITALIC SHE WILL ARRIVE IN ABOUT TWO MONTH
AND THE TWO UH VIS ONE AND VIS TWO ARE THE VISITOR PLACES
YOU HAD ONE I THINK CALLED FREE SPACE OR SPARE SPARE PLACE
UM WE DIDN'T REALLY REACH A VERY GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE TWO ROOMS
SO THE THE TWO AT THE CENTRE UH WHERE IS WRITTEN PAOLA YALINA THE TWO VISITORS AND THEN MARIA PLUS DAVID
SO I THINK THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF SPACE HERE TO UH SWITCH A LITTLE BIT AMONG THE PEOPLE JUST TO MAKE SOME KIND OF SMOOTH OCCUPANCY RATE
SO NOT TO HAVE ONE EMPTY ROOM WHEN WE HAVE NO VISITORS UM AND UH THEN A VERY FULL ROOM WHEN EVERYBODY IS IS HERE
SO I THINK WE'RE WE ARE QUITE WILLING TO SPLIT AND PUT SAY MAYBE ONE VISITOR WITH MARIA AND DAVID UH FIFTY PER CENT IN THE OTHER ROOM WITH THE SECOND VISITOR
SO THAT IT SMOOTH IS
WELL YEAH
EXACTLY SO THE VISITORS ARE UH BASICALLY STAGIEUR AND IT HAPPENS THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TWO OF THEM EVEN IF IT'S ONLY FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTH
MARTIN SEEMED TO INSIST THAT WHEN WE HAVE A VISITING PROFESSOR FOR INSTANCE
WE CANNOT REALLY PUT HIM WITH GISELLA BECAUSE WELL THEY WOULDN'T FEEL VERY NICE THEY THEY MADE A JOKE ABOUT THAT
SO WE SHOULD MANAGE SOME KIND OF DECENT SPACE
IT'S TRUE THAT THESE ONE OR TWO LAST ONE OR TWO YEARS WE DIDN'T HAVE UH A VISITING PROFESSOR
BUT UM
YEAH SO UH I THINK YEAH THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN POINTS
SO ONE IS THE PLACE OF THE LOUNGE
UH THE OTHER ONE IS THE UH THE PLACE OF THE ADMIN OFFICE WITH GISELLA
AND THE THIRD ONE IS THE NUMBER OF VISITOR VISITING PEOPLE AND UH WELL HOW MANY OF THEM WE WANT TO ACCOMMODATE AND WHERE WHERE WE PUT IT
THESE I THINK ARE THE THREE MAIN DIFFERENCES
OTHERWISE WE PRETTY MUCH AGREE ON UH ON PLACING PEOPLE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM SORRY
I I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S TRUE I THINK YEAH THEY ARE ARE QUITE OPEN TO TO THIS
MARTIN ALSO REMINDED US THAT HE IS QUITE NOISY
HE HAS A LOT OF UH PHONE CALLS TO MAKE EVEN IF IT'S HERE IF HE'S HERE ONLY FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TIME
UM SO YEAH I I I DON'T MIND THIS
BUT UH THAT'S SOMETHING BUT IT'S TRUE YEAH WE COULD ALSO TRY TO PUT A VISITOR AND THE PROFESSOR
UM MARTIN MADE ANOTHER POINT
IT WAS THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES PROFESSOR HAVE TO PROFESSORS HAVE TO DISCUSS SENSITIVE MATTERS ABOUT PROJECTS AND FINANCING
AND THEY SOMETIMES MIGHT FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DISCUSSING THIS WITH THEIR WELL IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR P. H. D. STUDENTS
LIKE SAYING OH I I HAVE TO REDUCE HER T FROM EIGHTY PER CENT TO FIFTY PER CENT
THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING SO I I MEAN ALL THESE ARE CONSTRAINTS
I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW YOU WOULD LIKE US TO PROCEED FROM FROM HERE OR IF YOU ALREADY HAVE QUESTIONS OR REACTIONS ON THIS ONE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH UM
WELL MM-HMM
YEAH WE YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
UM WELL WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT REALLY POSSIBLE TO BUILD WALLS BUT WE NOTICED THAT THIS ROOM ACTUALLY HAS TWO DOORS
SO UH WE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WE COULD PUT SOME KIND OF WELL SEPARATION
I YEAH MAYBE JUST YEAH FURNITURE OR JUST UH SOME KIND OF SCREEN
NO IT'S NOT SOUND PROOF
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH WELL IT WAS ACTUALLY THIS PRESSURE FROM FROM MY GROUP THAT LED TO THIS TO SQUEEZE A LITTLE BIT UH THE PLACE OF THE LOUNGE
NOW HOW FOR INSTANCE WOULD THE UNIVERSITY FEEL ABOUT A ROOM THAT WOULD BE ONLY USED AS A LOUNGE
WOULD THEY FEEL IT'S TOO EMPTY AND THAT WE HAVE TOO MUCH SPACE
OR W IS THERE NO PROBLEM
THE DO DO YOU SEE A PROBLEM WITH HAVING A L A ROOM JUST FOR A LOUNGE OR NO
SO WE COULD HAVE A SEPARATE ROOM AS A LOUNGE AS LONG AS UH WE PACK THE OTHER OFFICES
MM
PERSONALLY I I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS
SO UM THAT'S THAT'S FINE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY SO I THINK MAYBE WE CAN AGREE ON ON THE LOUNGE IN A SEPARATE ROOM IF WE CAN MANAGE TO TO FIND SPACE ELSEWHERE
WHAT ABOUT GISELLA HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PUTTING HER IN A SEPARATE OFFICE
WHICH IS THE CASE NOW I THINK
WELL SHE HAS AN EXTRA YEAH
WITH A VISITOR SPACE YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF VISITOR YOU ARE EXACTLY
SO WE COULD SAY SOME KIND OF LOW KEY VISITOR
THIS IS UH VERY NICE
MM-HMM
ACTUALLY GISELLA FIFTY PER CENT MEANS THAT SHE'S THERE HALF TIME UH GENERALLY IN THE MORNINGS
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM I THINK IT'S WHAT I TRIED TO TO DO BEFORE IT'S THE SHARED LOUNGE UH TH
UM
DO YOU HAVE ASSISTANTS WITH PROFESSORS
YEAH
NO I THINK THIS IS QUITE ACCEPTED AND IT'S A BIT THE CASE
NO I THINK IT'S UH THE LOUNGE UH THE ADMIN ROOM
AN
YEAH AND THE NUMBER OF SLOTS FOR VISITORS AND FOR THIS NEW STUDENT WHO ARRIVES
BECAUSE HAVING JUST ONE SPARE PLACE THIS WAS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST DISAGREEMENT IN MY GROUP
PEOPLE SAID UH WE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST TWO OR THREE SPARE PLACES JUST FOR YOU KNOW GROWING OR SOMETIMES YOU HAVE THREE INTERNS THAT ARRIVE
SO EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT PERFECT PLACES
UM
YEAH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S HOW WE DID IN IN OUR PROPOSAL YEAH
UH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH MM-HMM
BUT THEN WE NEED TO SQUEEZE IN IN ONE OF THE THREE PERSON ROOMS SOME EXTRA VISITOR SPACE AND UH I I THINK SO
IF IF WE WANT TO KEEP THE READING ROOM
UH I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BY PLAYING A LITTLE BIT WITH THE FURNITURE
UM SO YEAH
I THINK ANOTHER POINT HERE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU YOU FEEL ABOUT IT IS WELL
THE FACT THAT MARTIN IS SAID HE WOULD BE QUITE NOISY FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TIME
SO MANY PHONE CALLS
SO I WOULDN'T PUT HIM IN THAT BIG OFFICE EVEN IF HE'S FIFTY PER CENT BUT HE'S STILL A PROFESSOR HERE AND WE GOT HIM FROM E. P. F. L.
SO THAT I I THINK I MEAN IF WE NEED TO REACH A SOLUTION NOW I I WOULDN'T MIND WORKING FROM YOUR PLAN AND DOING SOME CHANGES
OR IF YOU PREFER WORKING FROM MINE AND DOING OTHER CHANGES
SO UM
OKAY YEAH
DEPENDS HOW HOW EASY YOU CAN WRITE IN IT
OKAY SO LET'S KEEP THE READING ROOM
UH ALSO I THINK PIERRETTE PIERRETTE AND MARTIN P SHOULD DESERVE AT LEAST I THINK OFFICES WITH ONE PERSON NOT WITH TWO
UH
YEAH
WE WE NEVER ASKED THEM IT COULD BE BUT UM ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY HAVE
I THINK NO REAL PROJECT IN COMMON SO I WONDER
WHE I I THINK I WOULD PREFER AND PROBABLY MY GROUP WOULD PREFER
TO SEE THEM WITH THE RESPECTIVE ASSISTANTS AND I THINK PIERRETTE PLUS MARIANNE IS A VERY GOOD COMBINATION
WHY NOT SWITCHING THEM FROM YEAH THAT OFFICE
YEAH SWITCH THE WHOLE GROUP
YEAH MARIANNE SWEDISH AND THEN PIERRETTE
BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO MARIANNES
AND BOTH FAMILY NAMES START WITH S. T. A.
NO
NO NOT TRUE
THE JUST S.
YES
MM-HMM
NOW LET'S DO SOMETHING WITH MARTIN TOO
UM
YEAH MAYBE WE CAN WRITE IT DOWN SAY VIS VIS ONE
DAVID IS FIFTY PER CENT AND VISITOR ONE SHOULD YEAH OR SPARE OR IT'S FINE
MM-HMM
GISELLA
YEAH MM-HMM
I THINK THAT'S CLOSER TO WHAT I SAID
WELL BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE HAVE THIS PROJECT IN COMMON
YOU KNOW CALL I. M. TWO
UM YEAH I THINK IT'S AND SO D COULD WE UM
MM-HMM
WELL I THINK YEAH ALWAYS GISELLA BUT I THINK THERE IS NO WAY TO UH
MM-HMM
YEAH SORT OF SECOND UH
UM YEAH
SO YOU WOULD PUT GISELLA IN A ONE PERSON ROOM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH WE COULD YEAH EVEN PUT
WE COULDN'T PUT MAGGIE AND BRUNO TOGETHER
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE CASE
MM-HMM
NO LET'S LEAVE IT LIKE THIS FOR THE MOMENT
HOW DO YOU FEEL BECAUSE YOUR OFFICE WELL THREE PERSONS AND YOU ARE ALL FULL TIME IN THERE SO YOU WITH NANCY AND MARIA
UH-HUH
YEAH AND YOU HAVE PARMENIDES IN COMMON WITH NANCY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND DO YOU THINK WE COULD PUT A VISITOR WITH NIKOS AND YALINA
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ALSO IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR YOU KNOW YALINA'S THAT WE SAID IN OUR MEETING
YALINA'S MASTER THESIS SHOULD BE DEFENDED IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS
SO WE COULD AT LEAST THINK IT'S SORT OF AN OPEN PLACE
OR WE COULD GET THAT OFFICE FOR YOU AND NANCY AND PUT NIKOS AND UH YALINA WITH MARIA AND A VISITOR
WHAT ABOUT THAT
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE A CALMER SPOT
YEAH
YEAH BUT A VISITOR ACTUALLY UH DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH PAPER SO FOR INSTANCE MAYBE THEY DON'T NEED UH
WELL UH THE PLACE TO PUT THEIR FILES YOU KNOW A SMALLER DRAWER
THEY JUST NEED A A DESK AND PROBABLY JUST ONE DRAWER UNDER UNDERNEATH
YEAH PROBABLY NOT
I THINK IT WOULDN'T BE UH YALINA AND MAYBE WE COULD THINK OF A VISITOR TOO HERE
SO THAT
THINK SO
BECAUSE REMEMBER THERE IS ALSO THIS PAOLA ARRIVING UM ON THE NEW PROJECT
SO YOU KNOW SUSAN INSISTED THAT UH
WE SHOULD BE
AND IT IT'S AL ALSO IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR BECAUSE NIKOS AND YALINA ARE WELL
NIKOS IS UM RESEARCH STUDENT YALINA WILL FINISH HER MASTER THESIS SO IT'S
YEAH OKAY
YEAH PAOLA OR MM-HMM
OR MAYBE PAOLA WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE
YEAH I THINK THAT'S QUITE OKAY
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY PREFERENCE OF MAGGIE BEING ALONE OR WITH BRUNO OR NO
YEAH
UM DAVID MENTIONED ALSO THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF GENDER BALANCE
UH I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A STRONG CONSTRAINT BUT I THINK WE ARE DOING PRETTY WELL
WELL SO
I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS WHAT WAS MEANT BUT
HA
OKAY THAT'S FINE IF HE MENTIONED THIS TO YOU THAT'S QUITE NICE
AND OKAY YEAH I'M WITH MARTIN
NOT VERY BALANCED
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S WHY OKAY IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SHARING THE OFFICE WITH MARTIN THAT'S FINE
OKAY YEAH THAT LOOKS GOOD
SO AGNES WITH MARIANNE AND DAVID
YEAH SO YOU HAVE I. M. TWO IN COMMON
THAT'S NICE AND HE IS FIFTY PER CENT SO THAT MEANS THE OFFICE IS NOT VERY CROWDED
OKAY THE OTHER ONE IS A BIT CROWDED BUT THAT'S OKAY
GISEL
MM-HMM
UM I I THINK FOR THE MOMENT
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL WHAT WAS SAID IN IN MY GROUP ACTUALLY SUSAN WHO KNOWS PROFESSORS FROM OTHER UM OTHER FACULTIES
WELL SHE NOTICED THAT MOST OF THEM HAVE ROOMS ALONE
SO THIS IS TRUE FOR SUSAN AND MAGGIE BUT NOT TRUE HERE FOR PIERRETTE AND AND AND MARTIN
SO WE CAN ALREADY ARGUE THAT UH WE'RE SQUEEZING IN EVEN THE THE PROFESSORS
IT'S TRUE THAT THE READING ROOM BUT YOU KNOW WE FOUGHT SO MUCH TO HAVE IT SO LET'S UH LET'S TRY TO HAVE IT THERE
AND I THINK PUTTING FOUR PEOPLE IN A THREE PERSON ROOM IS ALREADY A SIGN THAT UH WE ARE ALREADY QUITE UH QUITE FULL
SO UM I THINK YEAH IT'S NORMALLY THE NOMINAL CAPACITY OF THIS I THINK IT'S UH EIGHTEEN PEOPLE
UM EIGHTEEN OR OR SEVENTEEN
AND WE'RE ONLY FIFTEEN IF YOU DON'T COUNT PAOLA AND SOME VISITOR'S PLACE
AND I THINK IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT TO HAVE SPACE FOR VISITORS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE NO VISITORS OR IF YOU CANNOT TAKE A NEW
WELL INTERN DURING THE SUMMER YOU'RE VERY MUCH HANDICAPPED
SO I THINK WE'RE YEAH ON WELL THE REACTION OF MY GROUP WAS THAT THIS WAS ALMOST FULL ALREADY SO I WELL WE TRIED TO
I THIN
MM-HMM
YEAH SO I THINK YEAH
WHAT WE COULD SAY ABOUT THE READING ROOM IS THAT WE WE SQUEEZE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IN THE OTHER OFFICES SO I THINK IT'S OKAY
UM
MM-HMM
PERFECT JUST SAVE IT PLEASE
MAYBE IT'S ANOTHER NAME
JUST SAY OKAY IT'S FINE
OKAY
SO MY GROUP ALSO ASKED TO CIRCULATE THE FINAL PROPOSAL JUST TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO MAJOR PROBLEM
AND THE NUMBERS
AND WE'RE DONE
THANK YOU SIRS
YES
YEAH MARTIN
MAR
AH
YEAH HO
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
BUT YOU NO SPECIFIC UH VIEWS FOR MOUNTAINS OR OLD TOWN OR I MEAN PEOPLE PREFER ANY WINDOWS

OH OH K OKAY OH 'KAY
HMM
HMM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN ONE OF OLD TOWN
YEAH
OH
SO YOU CAN'T DO ANY PARTITIONS
I MEAN YOU PLAN TO DO ANY PARTITIONS IN THREE P PERSON ROOMS OR LIKE THIS KIND OF BLOCKS

YEAH
I MEAN THEY DON'T OKAY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN SECRETARY HAS SEPARATE ROOM
YEAH OKAY 'CAUSE
YEAH OKAY
MM
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
N D
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE CAN YOU COMBINE BOTH OR LIKE IN TWO PERSON ROOM PIERRETTE TOO
YEAH MARTIN IS FIFTY PER CENT
MAYBE
OKAY
YEAH
ONE IS FINISHING
OH
BUT THEN YOU CAN CREATE ON MORE SPARED PLACE IN THAT BIG THREE PIECE ROOM NO
YEAH SOMEWHERE
FIFTY PER CENT
YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT THEN YOU CAN MOVE ADMINISTRATION TO THE SINGLE ROOM
THE K BECAUSE SHE'S ONLY FIFTY PER CENT WORKING AND
AND SHE WILL
OH YEAH
YEAH AND GIVE THAT ROOM TO F SOME PROFESSOR WITH A STUDENT OR FROM FOR VISITOR WITH THE VISITING PLACE OR
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT YOU CAN'T PUT THREE DESKS IN THE TWO PERSON ROOMS
YEAH
YEAH
OH MM
MM
BUT EVEN LIKE YOU CAN PUT MM PAOLA IN ADMINISTRATE OFFICE LIKE
YOU'RE ALREADY THREE PEOPLE
MM IT LOOKS LIKE SMALL ROOM COMPARED TO THE OTHER THREE P
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
K
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT'S FINE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
THANK YOU
SO WE ARE HERE TO JUST MAKE THE POINT
WELL MAKE THE POINT YEAH
MAKE THE STATUS ABOUT THE SHOT DETECTION
TO SO YOU HAVE APPLIED THE SHOT DETECTOR TO SOME OF THE CINETIS VIDEO OR AT LEAST ONE AND UH SO WE CAN BASICALLY MAYBE JUST COMMENT ON ON THIS
MAYBE QUICKLY REMIND WHAT THE SHOT DETECTOR IS HOW THE SHOT DETECTOR IS WORKING BASICALLY
UH WE MIGHT BE ABLE ANYWAY TO GIVE YOU SOME REFERENCE
I MEAN YOUR REPORT IT'S IT SHOULD BE DESCRIBED THERE OR YEAH YEAH
YOU HAVE THE REPORT
OKAY
TO OLIVIER YEAH
AH OKAY YES THE KAYAK WI I WAS NOT EVEN WITH THE OTHER ONE OKAY
BY THE WAY I WAS UH GOING TO ASK SO I HAD SEEN THE VIDEO I YOU UH DID UM A DOWNSAMPLING OF THE VIDEO RIGHT
I MEAN
FOR UH BROWSING I MEAN
OKAY YEAH
SO THIS IS HIERARCHICAL NORMALLY SO YOU HAVE SCENES AND SHOTS BUT
BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE WE COULD PROBABLY YOU KNOW
LIKE GROUP ALL THE INITIAL ONES INTO ONE SCENE AND MAYBE AFTER WHEN THERE'S SOME THINGS INSIDE IT S SHOULD BE ANOTHER SCENE SO
WHICH ARE EXTRACTED I THINK UH
DOWNSAMPLING
YEAH
YEAH THE QUALITY IS THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING THAT
IT IT'S NOT THIS THAT YOU PROCESSED RIGHT
OKAY OKAY
SO HERE WE SEE THAT WE THE SHOT AT EIGHTEENTH AND AFTER TWENTY TWOS AND AFTER AGAIN
AND UH IF WE GO DOWN I MEAN MAYBE IN TERMS OF SHOT HERE WE CAN SEE THAT
RIGHT I MEAN SO NOW WE SEE SHOT SEVEN I SUPPOSE YEAH
UH YEAH OKAY SHOT NINE CURRENTLY SHOT TEN PROBABLY
ELEVEN OR TWELVE
NO ELEVEN
OR NO THIS IS TEN INDEED OKAY
YEAH
YEAH THIS ONE IT'S ELEVEN TWELVE
OR FOURTEEN SECONDS
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
YEAH IT'S INSIDE AND YEAH
IT'S REALLY A DISSOLVE OR IS IT REALLY LIKE IS YOU HAVE THE FEELING THAT IT'S BOTH
OKAY
BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT STANDARD MAN MADE MOVIES BECAUSE I WOULD SAY MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE COULDN DIDN'T DO ANY DISSOLVE
YEAH I COULD SEE HERE I MEAN THAT IT WAS LIKE HORSE IT WAS ONLY ONE SINGLE ONE
N YEAH YEAH
THIS IS THE ONE I I HAD SEEN YEAH
BUT AS I SAID I MEAN UH WITH EVEN THE MOTION DETECTOR WHEN IT'S BLACK IT'S THERE IS NOT S NO STRUCTURE
SO YOU DON'T ESTI YEAH BUT YOU DON'T REALLY ESTIMATE MOTION
WELL THERE IS NO STRUCTURE
THERE IS NO TEXTURE IF YOU WANT TO SAY SO AND THIS IS THIS IS NOT SO GOOD FOR THE MOTION
UH BUT FOR INSTANCE OF COURSE BETWEEN THE HORSE AND UH AND UM THE C THE C UH UH YEAH
UH THE COWS YEAH MAYBE WE COULD HAVE DETECTED THINGS
BUT IT'S NOT EVEN SURE BECAUSE THE BACKGROUND IS QUITE SIMILAR AND UH IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT THAT SURE
SO IT'S YEAH
THE HISTOGRAM SO WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH IT
SO IT'S IT'S SCRAMBLED SO YOU CAN SCRAMBLE THE IMAGE AND YOU GET THE SAME HISTOGRAM
SO THERE IS NO STRUCTURE INDEED SO OF COURSE WHEN YOU LOOK THE HORSE AND THEN YOU CAN SEE AS A COW THE COWS
OF COURSE YOU HAVE A BLACK IN THE TOP AND UH YOU HAVE ALSO UH MAYBE EIGHTY PERCENT OF LIKE GREEN UH
WHICH IS EVEN NOT GREEN THERE BUT UH UH GRASS
YOU HAVE STONES AND UH SO THERE OF COURSE ARE DIFFERENCES BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE HORSE BUT IT'S BLACK
SO YOU HAVE MORE SKY WHICH IS BLACK ON THE RIGHT SO YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS
SO IT'S A GLO IT'S GLOBAL IT'S A GLOBAL HISTOGRAM SO YEAH
BUT IT'S WHEN FOR THIS I WOULD FOR THIS APPLICATION I COULD IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD WERE QUITE HIGH
UH AND IT'S A THRESHOLD BUT STILL IT'S ADAPTIVE RIGHT IF I REMEMBER WELL YEAH
SO
BECAUSE OF COURSE IF YOU JUST COMPUTE THE YEAH
IF YOU HAVE THE REPORT BECAUSE IF YOU COMPUTE THE UM DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO HISTOGRAMS I THINK THIS WAS BHATTACHARYA
RIGHT
SO NOW WE KNOW
AND UH SO IF YOU TAKE UH THESE TWO WITH THE WITH THE BHATTACHARYA UH THEN OF COURSE YOU SHOULD JUST DO A THRESHOLD
WHEN THERE IS MOTION YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF THINGS CHANGING SO BY USING AN L. R. T. T. THRESHOLD
IF YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A CONTINUOUS CHANGE OF THE D DISTANCE YOU DON'T DO A THRESHOLD
IT'S ONLY IF YOU HAVE AN IDENTIFIED PEAK WHICH IS M FIFTY PERCENT OR MAYBE UH TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THE THE NEXT SECOND VALUE IN THE WINDOW
THEN YOU SAY IT'S IT'S A SHOT
RIGHT I DON'T KNOW
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
IT'S CONTINUOUS FOR DISSOLVE YEAH
BUT AN ANYWAY IT'S DIFFICULT I MEAN IN TH IN IN IN GENERAL
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE SOME DISSOLVE YOU COULD IMAGINE THEY ARE PART OF OF OF A SCENE AND UH SO
BUT OF COURSE WHEN YOU HAVE CUTS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE EASY TO DETECT RIGHT I MEAN LIKE SOMETHING YEAH
SO UH YEAH SO WITH THE MOTION BASICALLY THE MOTION TRIED TO ESTIMATE WELL THE MOTION BETWEEN TWO FRAMES
RIGHT IF MY IMAGE IS THERE BUT AFTER IT'S THERE AND IT LOOKS AT HOW MANY POINTS C ARE WELL MATCHED
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT LIKE SOMEBODY SPEAKING AND SO AND SO BEFORE THE SH BEFORE THE SHOT YOU CAN SEE THAT USUALLY THERE ARE LIKE NINETY PERCENT OF THE POINTS AT LEAST
RIGHT WHO HAVE SOME MOTION SO UH
BUT THEN AFTER SUDDENLY IF YOU GO FROM ONE FRAME AND YOU TRY TO MATCH ALL THE POINTS HERE WITH LIKE A TRANSLATION
PLUS THE ZOOM PLUS MAYBE SOME ROTATION
YOU C YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING WELL RIGHT
SO BASICALLY YOU WOULD SEE THAT THE NUMBER OF POINTS MAYBE ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THE POINTS YOU CAN MATCH WELL SO IT'S EASY TO DETECT
AND UH AFTER YOU CAN SEE THAT INDEED BECAUSE IT'S A LONG SHOT AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FLAT PLANE
YOU CAN DO A VERY GOOD REGISTRATION THROUGH THE NUMBER OF POINTS
IS VERY HIGH I MEAN THE NUMBER OF POINTS THAT ARE MATCHING
UH AND HERE YOU BASICALLY HERE WITH A HISTOGRAM UH YOU CAN SEE IT VERY FLAT
BUT OF COURSE YOU SHOULD GO FROM THIS HISTOGRAM TO THIS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY GREEN
YOU HAVE THIS BIG UH MEASURE WHICH IS HERE UH THE CHI TWO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS WHAT YOU IMPLEMENT IS USED IN THE NO IT'S
IT'S BHATTACHARYA
OKAY
YEAH SO YEAH AND YOU HAVE MAYBE A ONE IMAGE WITH A UM ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD I THINK
YOU HAD SOMETHING LIKE THIS RIGHT
JUST TO EXPLAIN UH HOW
YEAH UH
YEAH YOU SEE LIKE HERE
YEAH
ALPHA TIMES THE MAXIMUM OF THE OTHER ONES
OF THE OTHER ONES
SO THE OF COURSE IF IT'S YOU ARE NOT A MAXIMUM YOU ARE NOT GOING I INSIDE THE WINDOW YOU ARE NOT THE MAX
ANYWAY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE TO BE ABOVE UH ALPHA TIMES THE MAX OF THE OTHERS RIGHT UH BECAUSE ALPHA IS LOW LOWER THAN ONE
UH
LIKE FOR INSTANCE YEAH
LIKE FOR INSTANCE HERE I I SEE SIX BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS FOR BHATTACHARYA OR FOR UH CHI S CHI TWO
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
TWO POINT FOUR YEAH SO IT'S A BIT LESS BECAUSE THE AMPLITUDE IS MUCH SMALLER YEAH
UH YEAH
SO YOU CAN UH IT WAS NOT SO JUST I MEAN BECAUSE THE MOTION I MEAN IT WAS UH IN THE SHOT WE'VE SEEN
F BECAUSE F ESPECIALLY WITH CHI TWO SQUARE IT R THE AMPLITUDE IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN WITH BHATTACHARYA RIGHT
UH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT COULD GO TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND WHEN IT'S THERE IS NOTHING IT'S CAN BE ZERO
WITH BHATTACHARYA IT'S BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE SO YOU HAVE NOT SO MUCH AMPLITUDE
UM BUT UH STILL UH IN SOME OF THE V THESE VIDEOS FOR INSTANCE EVEN IF WE GON GO NOW IF WE WANT TO
BUT NOW FOR THE KAYAK CASE I DON'T KNOW
UH AT SOME POINT TARGETING TWO KAYAKS AND IT'S MOVING QUITE FAST TOWARDS TO OTHER PEOPLE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE IF IT WAS DETECTED AS A SHOT TRANSITION OR
YEAH YEAH
IT WAS IT AS A SHOT OKAY
I WAS UH WONDERING YEAH YEAH MAYBE
BUT HERE FOR INSTANCE YOU UNDERSTAND SO WE CAN SHOW THIS TOMORROW TO UH TO THE PEOPLE AT THE CI CINETIS MEETING I MEAN TO
RIGHT
YEAH OKAY YEAH WE NEED A CONNECTION THAT'S TRUE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH I CAN BRING MY LAPTOP IF NECESSARY YEAH YEAH
I'LL I'LL BRING IT OKAY SO IT'S IT'S DONE
WELL YEAH BUT NORMALLY THERE IS A A BURNING IF YOU C MAYBE YOU CAN PLAY THE SHOT OR
IT'S STRANGE I MEAN MAYBE YOU PLAY YEAH IF YOU PLAY THE THE VIDEO WELL INSI AT THE BEGINNING I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
AH YOU DIDN'T GENERATE THE OKAY THE REAL MEDIA
OKAY
WELL NO I MEAN HERE I CAN SEE THAT IT WAS IT WAS DETECTED AS A SINGLE SHOT
OKAY
I WAS BECAUSE HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MOTION UH HERE IS UH YOU KNOW HE IS UH DOING A ZOOM ON THE TWO KAYAKS HERE
YEAH AND THEN HE'S DOING QUITE A FAST TRANSITION FROM THESE TO ANOTHER ONE
AND I WAS WONDERING WHETHER SO IF YOU WELL THOUGH OF COURSE IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S MAINLY WATER
SO MAYBE THE COLOUR IS INDEED UH QUITE BUT YOU KNOW AS A KAYAK IS ENTERING QUITE FAST I MEAN YOU CAN HAVE QUITE MAYBE GOOD DISTANCE
BUT I SEE THAT IT SEEMS TO BE HOW MANY SHOTS DO YOU HAVE INDEED DE DE DETECTED
SIX YEAH THE ONE IS UH MAYBE SO YOU DID IT WITH WITH WHAT BY THE WAY
IT'S WITH THE IMAGES I GAVE YOU OR OKAY
AH TO REGENERATE AN A. V. I. FILE OKAY YEAH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN INITIALLY I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE IS A A SHOT DETECTED
AH OKAY SO THE OKAY SO THE HERE IS AN IMAGE NUMBER
IN YOUR PROGRAMME
AH OKAY OKAY YEAH
OKAY OKAY SO THEN THIS
SO BUT IT'S IN SECONDS OR IT'S
OKAY
OKAY YEAH OKAY OKAY SECONDS PLUS NUMBER
OKAY SO BASICALLY WHAT HAS BEEN UH YEAH EXTRACTED IS YEAH THIS POINT RATHER THAN OKAY SO THIS IS NORMAL OKAY
OKAY
OKAY LIKE TRANSITION SOMETHING THAT IS OKAY
YEAH IT'S MOTION YEAH IT'S NOT A CUT
YEAH BUT I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S MAINLY WATER WHEN WE SEE THINGS SO IT'S YEAH IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG UH BUT YEAH
SOMETIMES I MEAN YOU CAN HAVE VARIOUS THINGS HAP I MEAN JUST THINK ABOUT MORE ACTION MOVIE AND THING LIKE THIS
WELL SOMETIMES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SO FOCUS USUALLY THERE IS NO PROBLEM
PEOPLE SAY THIS IS A CUT THIS IS NOT A CUT BUT LIKE FOR DISSOLVE EVEN SOMETIMES
YOU KNOW
PEOPLE MAY IT'S PEOPLE MAY HAVE SOME TROUBLE I MEAN THIS IS A DISSOLVE THIS IS NOT THIS SHOULD THIS SHOULD BE LABELLED AS A TRANSITION OR NOT
SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY YEAH BUT IT'S PART OF THE THING OR UH FOR INSTANCE IN LIKE IN UM ALSO IN UH
COME ON UH ADVERTISING USUALLY
BECAUSE THE SHOTS ARE VERY SHORT IN ADVERTISING USUALLY IT'S UH VERY FAST AND SO SOMETIMES
YEAH WHEN YOU HAVE AN INCRUSTATION LIKE LAST TIME WHAT WHAT SHOULD YOU SAY IT'S IT'S YEAH IT'S A CHANGE OF
BUT UH
YEAH I MEAN IT'S A SO SOMETIMES VERY DIFFICULT
A AT LEAST WHAT I CAN SEE THAT CURRENTLY LIKE FOR CINETIS UH FOR INSTANCE IF IT'S TO DO COLOUR CORRECTION OR FOR INSTANCE IF IT'S TOO BLACK
TOO A BIT WHITER I THINK THIS TYPE OF THINGS SHOULD BE FINE
BECAUSE BASICALLY IT'S EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT REAL SHOTS THEY ARE NOT SO INTERESTED IF IT'S NOT REAL SHOT
MAYBE AFTER THEY HAVE THIS AND THEY MAY SAY OKAY JUST BY LOOKING AT LEAST THE SUMMARY
SO MAYBE FOR THE SUMMARY WE COULD DO BETTER UH KEY FRAME EXTRACTION FOR INSTANCE
BUT BY JUST LOOKING AT THE KEY FRAMES AND SO ON THEY MAY SAY OKAY
FROM THIS SHOT TO THIS SHOT WE APPLY LIKE UH SPECIFIC UM COLOUR ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM OR RESTORATION ALGORITHM OR UH TO IMPROVE UH THE BRIGHTNESS AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS RIGHT
AND UH SO I THINK FOR THEM THIS IS FINE UM AFTER I YEAH
WELL MAYBE AFTER I MEAN THEY WOULD SH OKAY UH THEY WOULD GO DIRECTLY AND SAY SELECT THE SHOTS FROM HERE TO HERE
AND THEY WOULD SAY YOU APPLY THIS ALGORITHM YEAH
SO OF COURSE WE COULD TRY TO MAKE SCENE CLUSTERING AND SO ON BUT I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT THIS IS NECESSARY FOR THEM AT THIS POINT
BECAUSE UH IF THEY HAVE A SIX MINUTE MOVIE IF THEY HAVE THIRTY SHOTS
FOR THEM IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO LOOK AT FROM HERE TO HERE I APPLY THIS AND THEY CAN DO IT QUITE QUICKLY
AND THEY HAVE TO DO IT AN TO DO IT ANYWAY
BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME MIGHT BE UH TO SELECT THE TYPE OF RESTORATION ALGORITHM OR THE TYPE OF THINGS
SO THIS MIGHT TAKE MORE TIME THAN HAVING TO CLICK TWO TIMES ON TWO SHOTS RATHER THA THA THAN UH HAVING DIRECTLY A SCENE RIGHT
SO SO I THINK FOR THEM UH THIS TYPE OF THINGS IS GOING TO BE USEFUL UH AT LEAST FOR THIS TASK
IF THEY WANT TO DO STABILISATION IT MAY NOT BE SURE OF THAT
UH THIS IS THE RIGHT SEGMENTATION FOR SOME OF THESE BUT SO BUT THIS IS ANOTHER POINT WHICH FOR MOTION STABILISATION
AS I SAID SEVERAL TIME WE ARE NOT WE DID NOT COMMIT TO PROVIDE ANYTHING
BUT OF COURSE IF WE CAN PROVIDE THINGS WE'LL DO IT BUT UH YEAH
SO DO YOU HAVE UH MORE QUESTION OR UH DO YOU HAVE A
WELL I JUST I I I IT'S I THINK THIS IS
YEAH BUT AFTER I MEAN IT MAY BE MORE LIKE A GUY UM I INT I IN AN INTERFACE A GUY INTERFACE
I MEAN WHERE I MEAN IF SECOND SELECT FROM SHOT ONE TO SEVEN
UH THIS IS A SAME SEG THEY MAY DO THE GROUPING BY THEMSELVES QUITE BY LOOKING AT THIS IT MAY TAKE W W LESS ONE ONE MINUTES
AND I THINK IT'S ANYWAY IF IT'S TOO SUMMARISED AFTER THEY MAY WANT TO GO INSIDE UH TO SEE WHETHER THERE IS NOT SPECIAL THINGS I MEAN SO
UH BECAUSE AFTER IT DEPENDS I MEAN IF YOU GIVE ONLY ONE KEY FRAME PER SHOT AFTER I MEAN IT'S ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY IMAGES
IT'S QUITE FAST RIGHT AND SO I THINK AND THE HIERARCHICAL THING IS GOOD
BECAUSE STILL YOU CAN CHECK IF YOU HAVE SOME AMBIGUITIES YOU ARE NOT SURE YOU COULD
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AT LEAST YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
WELL ULTIM ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS IS THE TYPE OF THINGS BUT AT THIS POINT WE UH YEAH
I I HOPE UH THAT UH IF IT'S A BIG SUCCESS UH THEY WILL ASK IDIAP TO TO PROVIDE SOMETHING LIKE THIS OF COURSE WITH SOME MONEY OR AT LEAST TO PAY A STUDENT OR SOMEBODY FOR DOING IT
BUT UH YEAH
OF COURSE THIS WAS ULTIMATELY I THINK ONE WAY OF UH IF YOU COULD PROVIDE LIKE CHAPTERS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
INDEED YOU COULD PROVIDE LIKE THE A. V. I. TO THE CLIENTS
AND HE MAY ASK FOR SPECIAL SERVICES OR UH AND EVEN TO JUST TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO DIFFERENT PARTS AND SO ON
BUT IT'S UH I MEAN UH THIS LABELLING MIGHT BE MORE EASY TO DO FOR THE CLIENT BY THE CLIENT
BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE I MEAN HE WE WANTS TO HAVE THIS AND THIS AND UH RIGHT SO
YEAH YEAH HE MAY WANT TO ORGANI YEAH YEAH
OTHERWISE I MEAN THIS BUT OF BUT OF COURSE IT MIGHT BE EASY TO DO A VERY SIMPLE SOFTWARE
WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE USER TO SELECT JUST THE SHOTS AND GIVE NAMES
AND AFTER IT WOULD GENERATE AUTOMATICALLY SOME INDEX AND UH AS A I SUPPOSE THE CLIENT MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SUCH A SUCH A THINGS IF HE COULD UH GENERATE AUTOMATICALLY ON THE D. V. D.
BUT FOR AND YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT BEFORE SENDING IN THE D. V. D.
YOU COULD ALLOW HIM TO L TO WATCH THIS TYPE OF INTERFACE AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SELECTION
SAY THIS IS THIS THIS IS THIS THIS IS THIS THIS IS THIS AND WHEN HE WOULD RECEIVE THE D. V. D.
HE WOULD INDEED UH GET ALREADY THE CHAPTERS THAT HE DECIDED TO PUT THERE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
AND I THINK THIS MAY IT IT'S GOOD THAT THIS IS A DEMO LIKE THIS
BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED INDEED BECAUSE I IMAGINE THAT SOME PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
UH YEAH SO I THINK THIS IS UH THIS IS A VERY GOOD UH AND A YEAH
BUT UH
SO THIS IS A KIND OF SERVICE I DON'T KNOW EITHER THEY GIVE IT FOR FREE AND UH
BUT UH
BUT YOU SEE THAT SOMETIMES EVEN HERE IT'S A BIT LIKE UH IT'S FOR INSTANCE IF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LIKE SOME MOTION COMPENSATION
UH YOU I IT COULD BE PROPOSED
BUT FOR INSTANCE HERE IT I WOU IT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC TO HAVE MOTION
SO I HERE IT'S FINE TO DO MOTION COMPENSATION BUT STABILISATION RATHER THAN YEAH
BUT
FOR INSTANCE HERE IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S
EFFECTS
OKAY
AH OKAY SO MAYBE LIKE HERE FOR INSTANCE IT IS A JUST REPRODUCED TWO TIMES UH
YEAH
SO THIS IS VI OKAY
THIS VIDEO IS ABOUT FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES RIGHT
AH OKAY SO THIS IS NOT THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN UH
OKAY
OKAY
IT'S IT'S IT'S REAL TIME RIGHT
I MEAN THE PROCESSING
YEAH
A BIT MORE THAN REAL TIME
WELL ANYWAY YEAH
YEAH NORMALLY IT COULD IT COULD GO FASTER
BUT I PROBABLY IT'S PROBABLE THAT EVEN FOR THE PROJECT YOU WOULD DO SOME OF THE REPROGRAMMING
I MEAN TO ESPECIALLY IF UH WE NEED TO INTERFACE NEW UH UM YEAH OR FOR JUST READING
I MEAN THE THE D. V. X. AND THING LIKE THIS SO IT'S UH UH SO TOMOR ANYWAY FOR THIS WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY YET
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SURE WHAT THEY WANT TO WHAT THE USER'S TOOLS FOR READING D. V. D. AND SO ON SO
AND S BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS IS SO DIFFICULT NOW YOU HAVE UM ALREADY LOOKED AT THE HISTOGRAMS AND OPEN C. V. COMPUTING DISTANCES AND SO ON
SO IF WE WANT TO DO A SPECIAL THING THAT PROBABLY RUNS FAST IT MAY BE EASIER TO DO IT DIRECTLY AND UH YEAH
BUT UH BUT YEAH THE INTERFACE IS VERY SO THE INTERFACE USES THE OUTPUT OF YOUR PROGRAMME
ESSENTIALLY OKAY
OKAY
MM
YOU CAN DO THE GET FRAME
BUT OTHERWISE IT'S NOT NECESSARY
OH YEAH NO NO NO
YE OKAY
OH NO NO YOU NEED YOU NEED TO GENERATE THESE IMAGES RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
AS A DIRECTORY YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
X. M. L. YEAH
ON THE SHOT
AND IT'S A SIMPLE FORMAT I SUPPOSE LIKE UH LIKE YOU HAVE SCENES AND SHOTS AND UH KEY S SOME TIME STAMPS
YEAH
SO BUT YOU'RE YEAH
YEAH I MEAN IT IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO
AND WHO HAS A RIGHT TO PUT WHO HAS A RIGHT TO PUT DATA ON THE M. M. M.
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
YES
AH OKAY YEAH
YEAH IF YO
IF YOU HAVE THE SAME UH DECOMPOSITION RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT MAY HAPPEN THAT UH FOR NINETY FRA NINETY PERCENT OF THE FRAME IT'S DIFFERENT
SO YOU SEE IT FINE BUT SUDDENLY YOU HAVE ONE OTHER FRAME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS AND WHERE IT COMES FROM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OH YOU MEAN BAC BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT'S THE M. M. M. CACHE
OKAY
SO THIS MEANS THAT WHEN IT'S DONE IF I GO ON MY COMPUTER AND I DO THE SAME IT'S NOT GOING TO ENTER IN MY CACHE
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE ALREADY THERE IN M. M. M. OKAY
SO IT'S TH IT'S SO IT'S NOT DONE ON IT'S SO IT'S NOT DONE ONLINE
THE FIRST TIME YEAH BUT AFTER IT'S IT TAKE OKAY
OKAY OKAY
I THOUGHT IT WAS EVERYTHING WAS GENERATED ON THE FLY TH SO
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
OKAY SO
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO COULD YOU SAY UH VIDEO NAME CINETIS SLASH SOMETHING
OR NOT
YOU TH OKAY
YOU THINK IT WOULD WORK OKAY
HMM
MM EVEN IF YOU WOULD R CHANGE A C. G. I. FOR INSTANCE
LET'S ASSUME THAT WE SAY WE DON'T DO ANY SCENE THING THEN WE COULD REMOVE LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE SCENES RIGHT
I WAS THINKING THAT HERE IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE ONLINE VIDEO STRUCTURE CORRECTION
UH WHICH MEANS THAT
OKAY
YEAH
UH
THIS IS WISH WISHABLE UH FUNCTIONS
OKAY TO DO THIS
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
NO I WAS THINKING
NO BECAUSE I WAS THINKING IF IT'S THERE I MEAN WE COULD USE IT UH UH WE COULD UH YOU SEE BUT UH YEAH
NO NO
FRO FROM OUTSIDE WE CAN VIEW THEM
YEAH FROM HOME I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS THEM
NO
OKAY
NOBODY ACTUALLY IT HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED SEVERAL TIMES AND PEOPLE THERE ARE SOME LAWYERS THAT ARE PUTTING NO
BUT YEAH
Y
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH NO NO YEAH
NO
BUT YEAH IT'S GOOD TO
YEAH IF WE I YEAH
IT MIGHT BE GOOD INDEED IF WE START D BUILDING SOME EXPERIMENTS LIKE THIS STILL TO HAVE A PASSWORD
RIGHT YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
HMM
YEAH YEAH WHAT'S YEAH YEAH
HMM
YEAH IT WAS DONE INDEED F TO BE MORE GENERAL THAN JUST TO DO THE SHOT DETECTION
SO THAT'S WHY THE CODE IS A BIT MORE COMPLEX I THINK CURRENTLY
UH BUT UH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
JUST
YEAH
AH OKAY YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT WAS THE SAME THE SAME ONES AS THE ONE YOU SAW UH IN MY CODE YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY YEAH
YEAH UH OKAY
YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S GOOD YEAH
OKAY THAT'S GOOD YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT WHY IS AFTER I MEAN IF THERE IS A SHOT YOU DON'T KNOW BETWEEN BECAUSE YOU DROPPED ONE FRAME
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IS THE SH UH THE D THE SHOT
SLIDING WINDOW
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW I'M I'M SURE THAT THEY WILL BE WELL I HOPE THEY WILL BE A OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS YEAH
THE OUTPUT
YEAH
THIS GENERATES YEAH
HO HOW DO YOU GENERATE THE REAL MEDIA YEAH
OKAY
OH O O OH YEAH YOU MEAN THE JAVA FRAMEWORK UH WHAT UH MIKE PRESENTED
WE CANNOT PLAY UH REAL MEDIA OKAY
OKAY
FORMATS FORMATS YEAH
OKAY SO I THINK THIS WAS GOOD TO SEE THE THE TOOL AND UH TOMORROW WE ARE GOING TO RE SAY MOST OF THE THINGS
BUT SHORTER I F I BELIEVE RIGHT I MEAN IT'S BAD TO EXPLAIN
AND I THINK MAYBE LATER W YEAH WE WE CAN START DOING SIMPLE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH THE FULL UH
YEAH MI THIS MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO SEE TOMORROW
OF COURSE MAYBE THERE WAS THE AH ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SHOTS OR IT'S A LOT
BUT UH AFTER I MEAN AT THIS POINT WE DO WE HAVE NOTHING WE CAN DO UNLESS THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH IT RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
BUT I THINK I THINK IS IT'S TOO IT'S GOING VERY BE VERY TO BE VERY GOOD FOR THEM TO VISUALISE HOW YOU CAN ORGANISE THINGS AND MAYBE WHAT THEY CAN DO
HOW THEY AND SO THIS IS IMPORTANT
MM-HMM YEAH
YEAH INITIALLY YEAH
WELL WE DIDN'T BECAUSE YOU TRIED TO DO SOMETHING
OKAY
YEAH LIKE FOR INSTANCE IF WE NEED TO FIND SUB SHOTS
USUALLY IT IT FOR INSTANCE IS BETTER TO HAVE THE WHOLE SHOT TO DECIDE ON HOW TO BUILD THE SUB SHOTS
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT MAYBE I IF YOU STORE ALL THE DISTANCE AT THAT THE DISTANCES WE COULD DO SOME BASIC STUFF
OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S THE THING YEAH
AH TH THE GAP YOU MEAN OR NO
OH NO YOU MEAN IN THE BHATTACHARYA DISTANCE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO
IT'S OKAY
OH YEAH
YOU DON'T PUT YOUR HEADSET MICROPHONE
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I HAVE ACTUALLY YEAH THE WE CAN SEE THE REPORT HERE AND THE DEMO
AND THE GOAL OF UH THIS MEETING IS TO PRESENT THE VIDEO SHOT DETECTOR TO OLIVIER OKAY
OKAY
SO YEAH IT WAS MY PROJECT UM DURING MY INTERNSHIP AT IDIAP UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF JEAN MARC
AND AS YOU SAW AS YOU SAW IN THE EMAIL I SENT UH OKAY
I DIDN'T SEND THIS VIDEO IS THE NEW ONE
I JUST UM UH PROCESSED FROM YOUR IMAGES
YEAH
BUT UH LET'S LET'S START BY THE VIDEO FROM FRIDAY
CINETIS DEMO ONE
YEAH
SO THIS WAS UH
OKAY
YEAH HERE ON THE LEFT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS BUT UH AS APPLIED
SO THIS DETECTOR UH DETECTED THE THIRTY SHOTS
AND IF YOU CLICK ON UH PLUS BUTTON YOU CAN EXPAND IT AND SEE THE KEY FRAMES THAT ARE IN FACT UH FIVE EXTRACTED FRAMES FROM THE SHOT
BUT I THINK TH UH AS IT IS IT'S T EXTRACTED UH WITHOUT UH USING SUB SHOTS UH IT'S SIMPLY UH FIVE DOWN SAM YEAH DOWN SAMPLING
UM SO I WE CAN SEE THE VIDEO ACTUALLY UH THE ENTIRE VIDEO CAN OPEN WITH REAL PLAYER
I HOPE IT WILL WORK
SO WE DON'T HAVE THE THE SOUND AND IT WON'T BE GRABBED THE VIDEO WON'T UH I DON'T KNOW IF UH
OKAY IT'S NOT GOOD QUALITY
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH
NO NO NO NO NO NO
IT'S IN REAL MEDIA SO IT'S VERY COMPRESSED
UH OKAY
UH TEN YEAH
AND THEN THERE'S UM
OKAY
YES
AND THIS ONE YEAH IT'S A DISSOLVE IT'S A DISSOLVE SO IT DOESN'T DETECT YEAH
WHEN I SAW THE M. WITH M. PLAYER IT'S A DISSOLVE YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ONE IF WE SEE WAS CORRECTLY UH YOU SEE
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THERE IS A MOON
BUT OKAY BECAUSE THERE IS NO MOTION IN FACT BETWEEN THE TWO SHOTS
YEAH OKAY OKAY
THE COW
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH MAYBE TO EXPLAIN THIS METHOD WAS USING UH A SIMPLE UH UH DISTANCE BETWEEN UH CONSECUTIVE HISTOGRAMS
AND WE DIDN'T USE MOTION FEATURES AT ALL FOR THAT THAT'S WHY I WE
YEAH OKAY
ENOUGH
YEAH
YEAH
WITH A SLIDING WINDOW
I CAN SHOW YOU UH
YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW IF WE C WE WANT TO MAKE UH USE THE WHITEBOARD OR HERE IT'S UH IT WAS UH TO DIS IT'S INFRA ONLY THE THIS PART ABOUT UH SHOT BOUNDARY DETECTION IS IN FRENCH UNFORTUNATELY
BUT UH THE THIS IMAGE SHOWS THE RESULTS USING MOTION WHEN YOU S USE THE MOTION FEATURES AND HERE ON THE RIGHT IS WHEN USING THE HISTOGRAM UH DISTANCE
AND THE THE MOTION FEATURES CAN BETTER SHOW WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN THERE IS SUCH A DIFFICULT UH TRANSITION WHILE WITH THE HISTOGRAM UM
YEAH IT JUST SHOWS THAT THERE IS A SHOT UH CHANGE AT THE END BUT EVEN FOR DISSOLVES
I DON'T HAVE EXAMPLES HERE BUT UM THERE IS NOT A STRICT UH TRANSITION
UH IT'S CONTINUOUS FOR DISSOLVES
DISSOLVES IS UH YEAH
YEAH
NO NO NOW IT'S UH WELL FOR THE VIDEO YOU SAW IT WA IT'S BHATTACHARYA
YEAH
OKAY SET THE BEGINNING
SO THERE IS THE IDEA IS HAVING A SLIDING WINDOW
UM WE HAVE ALREADY ALL THE DATA THAT IS ON THE GRAPH
AND THEN TO DETECT UH THE THE THE THE CHANGES WE WE DO A CALCULATION UM WITH POINTS UNDER THIS SLIDING WINDOW WITHIN THIS SLIDING WINDOW
AND UH WE CALCULATE SO WHAT DO WE HERE
UM
IN FA WE WANT TO DETECT THAT UH THIS POINTS IN THE MIDDLE IS HIGHER THAN UH
TH
EXACTLY YEAH
ALPHA
ALPHA TIMES THE MAXIMUM OF THE OTHER ONES
THE C
BUT IF YOU ARE IN THE MAXIMUM ALREADY AND AT THIS POINT WE CHECK SIMPLY IF UH THIS VALUE IS ALPHA TIMES THE THE MAX OF THE OTHER POINTS
LET'S SAY THESE POINTS HERE
UM I MAYBE FOR CHI IT'S IT SIX BUT UH YEAH BUT UH FOR BHATTACHARYA IT'S FOR THE TESTS I DID IT TWO POINT FOUR
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
NO
MM
UH I IN THE THE FIRST SHOT
YEAH I SAW THAT IT WAS DETECTED AS A SHOT YEAH
YOU WANT TO SEE NOW
OKAY
BUT HE DIDN'T OKAY
IT IS UH OKAY
THIS IS IDIAP LAPTOP SO YOU CAN U OKAY
SO HERE IN FACT AFTER TWELVE UM I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S I THINK IT'S TWELVE FRAMES
YEAH
OH YEAH MAYBE YOU'RE BURNING BUT
OH THERE IS NO HA HA
I DIDN'T UH HA I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO THE THE REAL MEDIA
BUT UM YEAH IT'S COMPLICATED
YEAH HERE WE CAN SEE THAT YEAH
AT TWO POINT FOUR
MM
AND THEN THERE IS TRANSLATION ON THE RIGHT YEAH
MM MM MM
I CAN SEE UH THERE IS ANOTHER PROGRAMME THAT CAN SEE
UH THE N. UH
IT'S I THINK IT'S F THERE THERE ARE FIVE NORMALLY
IF WE PUT EXPAND ALL
YEAH
THE OTHER ONE I HAD PROBLEMS CONVERTING UH UH THE VIDEO INTO D. V. X.
AND THEN UH SO I USED THE PROGRAMME FROM UH SOFTWARE FROM SEBASTIEN P. P. A. P. M. TO A. V. I.
BECAUSE YEAH ONE THING UH MAYBE WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IS THE LIBRARY UH
IT'S UH IT DOESN'T UH COMPILE ANYMORE ON DEBIAN MACHINES AND YEAH SOME MAYBE SOME WORK HAS TO BE DONE ON THIS
I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS UH IMAGE DOESN'T APPEAR THIS IS THE UM UM THE FRAME THAT IS UH UH EXTRACTED TO BE THE SHOT KEY FRAME HERE
THIS ONE IS THIS ONE THE MIDDLE ONE
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHY IT DOESN'T APPEAR BUT IT JUST UH A SIMPLE PROBLEM IN THE GET FRAME
BUT WHAT I CAN SHOW YOU NOW IS A LITTLE PROGRAMME IF WE WANT TO BE UM VERY PRECISE ABOUT SO IT'S MA GET FRAMES
OKAY C. G. I. HERE
AND WE WERE INTERESTED IN AROUND WHAT DI DO YOU WANT
AROUND SIX SEVEN SECONDS
OKAY
UH IF WE DO NEXT
OH
YEAH
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG
SO IT DETECTS
YEAH IN FACT YEAH THAT'S WHY I SAID IT'S IT'S A FRAME NUMBER
UH W I DON'T KNOW WHY YEAH YEAH YEAH
IT'S A FRAME NUMBER
THIS IS A FRAME NUMBER THIS IS IN SECOND BUT I I KEPT THE FRAME NUMBER
IT'S TWELVE FRAMES ZERO SECONDS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO IF WE DO EVERY SECOND UH I D THE MIDDLE FRAME IS UH THIS ONE THOUSAND
OKAY
DO YOU THI IT'S ANOTHER KIND OF BROWSING PAGE
BUT UH TO BE MORE PRECISE ABOUT UH TO TO CHECK MAYBE THE THIS YEAH EXACTLY YEAH YEAH
ANYWAY YOU GO BACK TO ONE FRAME AROUND F ONE SIXTY FOR INSTANCE I DON'T KNOW
AND AND THERE IS YEAH THAT'S IT YOU KNOW
PREV
OKAY
YOU SEE THAT THERE IS UH OKAY IT'S NOT A SHOT CHANGE IT'S A MOTION ACTUALLY HERE
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH I S YEAH
YEAH
WHEN YOU HAVE YEAH THE THE GOAL RESULTS UH THEN YEAH IN FACT IT'S NOT A SHOT CHANGE
YEAH
YEAH
SO THIS WOULD MA BE MADE UH MANUALLY ACTUALLY
WHEN YOU SAY FROM THIS SHOT TO THIS SHOT IS USING A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SOMEONE WHO WOULD DO MANUALLY FOR EACH VIDEO
METHOD YEAH
YEAH MM
YEAH
AH OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM
OKAY
THIS IS THE ONE IN THE D. V. D.
MAYBE OKAY WE CAN UH SEE A LITTLE BIT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE
WELL NO IT'S OKAY
OKAY UH IN FACT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT
BUT NOW I UNDERSTAND BETTER THAT CINETIS WANTS THIS KIND OF METHOD TO HELP THEM TO RESTORE AND TO APPLY THE ALGORI SOME ALGORITHMS TO TO TO MAKE A BETTER MOVIE
OKAY
IT'S NOT FOR THE CLIENT FOR THE USER WHO WILL UH MAYBE OKAY
OKAY
ALSO BUT OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH UH OKAY
OKAY
AH OKAY YEAH YEAH YEAH
BECAUSE HE DID THE MOVIE SO HE WANTS T OKAY TO ARCHIVE HE WANTS TO OKAY
THIS IS YEAH ANOTHER MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
AND THIS COULD BE DONE BY THROUGH INTERNET
MM
MM-HMM
FROM THE CLIENT POINT OF VIEW AND FROM THE PREPARATION OF THE MOVIE D. V. D. MM
OKAY I WILL PLAY YEAH
WE HAD AN ARROW HERE OR WHAT
IT'S
TH
IF I GO TO MENU THERE IS SOMETHING
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS
NO OLD MENU UH THERE IS NO MENU IN THE D. V. D.
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO THIS IS THE SAME VIDEO A THE THE A. V. I. NUMBER ONE
AND ON THE ON THE D. V. D. I SAW THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER STUFF
I DUNNO
THIS ONE
THE SAME
OKAY
OOPS
AH OKAY
UH
THERE ARE TWO FILES
OKAY I UNDERSTAND
OKAY
RUN THE OKAY
UM
YEAH ALMOST
I WOULD MAYBE A LESS A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN UH A BIT MORE THAN REAL TIME MAYBE
I WILL HAVE TO CHECK BUT IF IT'S FIVE MINUTES VIDEOS IT'S LIKE DONE IN YEAH QUICKLY
OKAY
COMPONENTS OPEN C. V.
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OPEN C. YEAH
YEAH
SO THAT WE'LL USE THE WHITEBOARD
SO IN FACT YEAH THE INTERFACE IS QUITE IS QUITE SIMPLE TO USE
UM FOR INSTANCE YOU SEE UM ON THE UH ON THE U. R. L. I PUT OKAY I I DISCO THERE IS M. M. M. DOT IDIAP DOT C. H. SLASH V. C. G. I. BIN
SLASH VIDEO BROWSER
OKAY UH SLASH VIDEO BROWSER THREE FRAMES
THREE FRAMES DOT H. T. M. L.
AND THEN THIS C. G. I. PROGRAMME ASK THE MM PARAMETER C. VIDEO AND M. EQUALS CINETIS OKAY DEMO ONE
IN FACT UM I JUST EXPLAIN HOW TO PUT THE DATA ON M. M. M. BUT IT'S QUITE SIMPLE
WHEN YOU LOG INTO M. M. M. AS WITH A C. C. S. S. H. FOR INSTANCE UM SO YOU JUST PUT IT'S WORKING LIKE THIS M. M. M. DATA
VIDEO BROWSER
UH OKAY SLASH
AND THEN
THIS IS THE NAME OF THE NEW DIRECTORY YOU WILL CREATE
DEMO ONE
AND THERE STANDS THERE IS COUPLE OF THINGS WELL IT'S UH
THIS NAME SO I WILL SAY THIS IS VIDEO NAME SO VIDEO NAME
DOT A. V. I. YOU JUST BECAUSE WE NEED THE A. V. I. SO THAT WE CAN UH
YEAH WE CAN DO THE THE GET FRAME
OTHERWISE IT'S NOT NECESSARY
OH UH F AND ALSO FOR THE
YEAH AND THIS IS NO NO NO UH THIS IS DONE ON THE FLY
WITH GET FRAME
SO YOU NEED THAT YOU NEED UH THE X. M. L. V SO IT'S VIDEO NAME
AND I COULD DATA DOT X. M. L. BUT IN FACT IT'S JUST A SIMPLE CONVENTION I W COULD HAVE PUT NOTHING BUT I JUST PUT DATA
THE IT'S A CONVENTION
DATA AND THEN VIDEO NAME
OKAY IT'S R. M. NINE DOT R. M. FOR OTHER STUFF
BUT IN FACT YEAH WHEN I THINK NOW WE COULD HAVE UH
ONLY WITH UH EXTENSION YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE
THE NAME IS NO OF IN FACT YEAH IS IS YEAH
YEAH IS THE SAME AS THE DIRECTORY
IT COULD HAVE BEEN VIDEO NAMING ALSO BUT IT'S THE SAME AS A DIRECTORY
AND THAT'S IT ACTUALLY
WHEN YOU YOU U YOU DO THAT
I DID THE SAME FOR KAYAK YOU SAY KAYAK IN FACT NOW IT'S KAYAK AND THEN YOU CAN SEE
AND THIS OUTPUT YEAH AS YOUR THIS OUTPUT UH THIS FILE IS AN OUTPUT FROM THE MM THE SOFTWARE THE SHOT BOUNDARY DETECTION SOFTWARE
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE FORMAT YEAH
YEAH UH ACTUALLY WE
UH YEAH I DON'T YEAH WE CANNOT SEE
IT'S YEAH IT'S UH THA VIDEO SCENE SHOT
IT'S HIERARCHICAL IN X. M. L. AND KEY FRAME TIME STAMP AND THE AND FROM THE TIME STAMP AND THE VIDEO LOCATION HE KNOWS HOW TO GET THE FRAME
EACH OF THESE FRAMES
AND IF WE DO IN FACT I DON'T KNOW YEAH IT'S MOZILLA FIREFOX VIEW PAGE SOURCE OKAY VIEW FRAME SOURCE
AND EVERY FRAME IS STORED INTO UH A B A BACKUP IN FACT EVERY FRAME UM IT'S M. M. M. WHO MANAGE THIS AUTOMATICALLY
SO THAT UM WHEN UH YOU ASK FOR THIS FRAME IN FACT WE CAN OKAY I JUST VIEW FRAME SOURCE
WHEN I VIEW IMAGE WHEN I SAY VIEW IMAGE
WHEN I SAY VIEW IMAGE ON THIS FRAME
UP WE GO THERE AND THIS IS UM IN FACT IT'S A PERL PROGRAMME THAT OUTPUTS IN FA INSTEAD OF OUTPUTTING H. T. M. L. OR TEXT IT OUTPUTS UH J. PEG
FROM THE VIDEO WITH A TIME STAMP IT OUTPUTS A J. PEG
THIS IS QUITE UH NICE
AND
YEAH
AND THIS IMAGE IS I THIS IMAGE IS OUTPUT UH OUTPUTTED TO THE CLIENT
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH YEAH
THAT'S WHAT I DID UH
HERE
IN THE OTHER APPLICATION YEAH
YEAH I DUNNO
YEAH HERE
I F THERE ARE YEAH THE M. M. M. DEVELOPERS SO I'M PART OF THAT BUT UH WE COULD WE COULD UH YEAH IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
UM I WANTED TO SAW TO SEE TO DO S SAY SOMETHING ELSE
UM OH YEAH AND THE IMAGES ARE SENT TO YOUR BROWSER THE CLIENT TO THIS BROWSER
BUT ALSO KEPT IN UH A DIRECTORY IN UH ON M. M. M.
EXACTLY A CACHE
I SAY BACKUP BUT IT'S A CACHE
UM THAT'S THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
NO NO NO IT'S OKAY
UM FOR THE CACHE UH
WE HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE ON M. M. M. SO THE THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM AH YEAH FOR A NEW WINDOW
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH
AND IT DETECTS OKAY
YEAH
SO YOU GO INSIDE THE GET FRAME FUNCTION YOU SEE WHERE IT I IT SAVES IT
AND THEN THERE IS A SPECIAL NAMING CONVENTION AND YOU CAN REMOVE THE BUT I IT'S C YEAH IT'S TRUE
NO
BECAUSE THERE IT'S IN CACHE SO THAT IF I PUT ANOTHER VIDEO WITH THE SAME NAME THEY TH THEY WILL HAPPEN AGAIN
THEY WILL UH APPEAR THIS FRAMES WILL APPEAR
YEAH YEAH EX IF YOU HAVE THE SAME DECOMPOSITION BUT
BUT UH YEAH ON M. M. M. F NOW WE DON'T HAVE SUCH MANY VIDEOS SO
BUT IF YOU PUT YEAH IN ANOTHER DIRECTORY UH THEN IT WOULD WORK OR OR A NEW NAMING CONVENTION WITH UH SPECIAL UH YEAH CODE UH
YEAH M. M. M. CACHE
YEAH
BUT IT IT CAN GO IN THE BROWSER CACHE ALSO
THE FIRST TIME IS DONE ONLINE
YEAH YOU CAN SEE HERE YEAH
UH THE FIRST TIME IS DONE O
YOU KNOW YOU SEE THAT
WELL HERE IT'S IT WAS CACHE BECAUSE I ALREADY PRESSED PREVIEW BUT NOW IT'S ON THE FLY
SO IT'S QUITE QUICK
THIS
AND THEN IF YOU COME YEAH
BECAUSE THE IMAGES ARE ALREADY GENERATED
AND MAYBE THEY ARE ON THE CACHE OF THIS BROWSER THIS COMPUTER
SO OKAY
THAT'S WHY IT'S YEAH IT WAS UH USED WITH UH YEAH SEBASTIEN UH DID THE C. FUNCTION AND UH YEAH
AND UH THE THE IS CALLING THIS UH C. UH EXECUTABLE AND IT WAS USED WITH M. M. M. SERVER WITH PIERRE A AND THE BEGINNING WHEN YEAH
UM YEAH YEAH
OH THE MOVIES OR
IN FACT UH WE WE WE COULD YOU KNOW OKAY YOU KNOW ALL THESE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE THAT YOU SEE UH OKAY
IN FACT OKAY
MM YES
YES WE COULD DO THAT
WE COULD PUT UH CINETIS SLASH HERE AND THEN A CINETIS SLASH IS THE SA YEAH IT WORKS
BUT THE UH TH THE POINT IS THIS INTERFACE IS UH I THINK SIX OR SEVEN FILES ONLY
X. M. L. UH WELL IT'S PER C. G. I. THAT OUTPUT X. M. L. AND X. S. L.
SO IT'S IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL TO TO TO MAKE A NEW LIKE A CINETIS BROWSER OR YOU KNOW VIDEO BROWSER
YEAH WE W WE COPY ALL THE FILES AND THERE IS UH JUST ONE UM ONE PARAMETER ONE UH STRING
THAT WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THIS DATA IS AND WE COULD PR CREATE A M. M. M. DATA VIDEO BROWSER UH CINETIS OR SOMETHING ELSE
Y IT'S UH EX EXTENSIBLE AND UH IS
YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT I IT'S NOT UH IT WAS UH YOU KNOW THI THIS IS WORKING THE EXPAND ALL BUT UH THIS IS UH
YEAH TO DO LIST OR SOMETHING
ON A VIDEO ANNOTATION ON A VIDEO STRUCTURE CO CORRECTION
BUT I IT'S NOT EASY ON THE WEB WITH H. H. T. M. L. PAGES TO TO DO UH SUCH CORRECTIONS LIKE UH VIDEO STRUCTURE CORRECTIONS FOR INSTANCE
FOR THAT YOU NEED IT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE UH ON INTERFACES LIKE FLASH OR JAVA
UH BUT STILL UH I I I THERE IS UH IT TAKES BAS MORE WORK AND BUT I YEAH YEAH I MEAN IT'S GOOD GOOD POINT
WELL UH YOU WE CAN MAKE FOR FOR INSTANCE FOR T. S. R. T. S. R. UH VIDEOS
ALESSANDRO UH ASKED ME TO DO THE SAME THING AND WE I PUT UH WE HAD UH LIKE A PASSWORD CONVENTION
SO THIS IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE FOR THESE VIDEOS
SO IT'S NOT UH
WELL IF YEAH IT IS THERE IS NO POSSIBLE PRODUCTIONS FOR THESE VIDEOS
MAYBE WHAT I SAY I'M VERY TIRED
BUT UH IF PO YEAH IT'S DEMO AND UH ONE CAN SAY YOU HAVE TO GUESS THE NAME TO BUT UH YEAH
BU Y YEAH A GOOD POINT UH ABOUT PASSWORD PROTECTION ISSUES UH OR THE PRIVACY ISSUES UH
OKAY
UH HA YEAH ALL THE FRAMEWORK IS READY WITH A T. R. S. T. S. R. VIDEOS SO
USUALLY WHAT WE DO SOMETIMES UH OKAY JUST TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT PASSWORD PROTECTIONS
SOMETIMES
INSTEAD OF HAVING UM
A PURELY SECURE DIRECTORY WE P WE WE PUT A CO CODE NUMBER LIKE UH SO THAT IT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS INSTEAD OF VIDEO M UH NAME EQUALS KAYAK THEN WE WOULD HAVE UH ZERO SIX SEVEN UH FIVE OR
YOU KNOW TWO
AND THEN THIS DIRECTORY FROM OUTSIDE WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE THAT OKAY NOT ONLY THE VIDEO NAME THIS U. R. L. IS NOT ACCESSIBLE
BUT ALSO WE SHOULD TAKE CARE THAT IN FACT M. M. M. IT'S IN M. M. M. DATA VIDEO BROWSER AND THIS IS ACCESSIBLE FROM OUTSIDE
WE SHOULD TAKE CARE THAT THIS DIRECTORY OR IN FACT THIS DIRECTORY IS NOT LISTABLE YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT LIST FROM OUTSIDE UH WITH UH F. T. P. OR H. T. T. P.
YEAH SIMPLE THINGS WITH PRIVACY ISSUES BUT UH I THERE ARE SOME METHODS AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THINGS PRIVATE
I YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING BUT I WOULD SAY THAT FOR THE C. CODE UH
YEAH I I I JUST WANT WOULD LIKE TO STRESS SOMETHING IS THAT UM YEAH
IF YOU WANT WANT TO USE THE NEW VERSIONS ETCETERA
I THINK UH WE NEED TO GO A LITTLE BIT THROUGH THE CODE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TO TO HELP TO TO FOR INSTANCE THE CLASSES ABOUT VIDEO STRUCTURE
ETCETERA TO PUT THEM YEAH
AND
YEAH IN FACT IT'S NOT THERE IS NO TOSH I IT WAS CALLED VISION LIB TO READ UH TO TO EXTRACT ONE FRAME EACH FRAME OF A VIDEO
YOU KNOW
SO IT WA FROM SEBASTIEN IT WAS IN THE TOSH LIBRARY
BUT UH IT'S NOTHING W TO DO WITH TOSH AND IT'S USING UH UH THE OPEN C. V. AND UH SOME CLASSES FROM UH JEAN MARC UH FOR
YEAH BHATTACHARYA DISTANCE ETCETERA
IMAGE PROCESSING
IMAGE PROCESSING AND STUFF
WE CAN FORGET TOSH YEAH
YEAH
UM SO IT'S FOUR THIRTY SO WE NEED ONE HOUR IT'S IT'S GOOD
JUST IF YOU WANT YEAH
THIS IS THE PARAMETERS OF THE OF THE C. PROGRAMME BUT UH USAGE
VIDEO IN OKAY
UH THE OUTPUT FILE X. M. L.
OUTPUT FILE DIST IT'S THE DISTANCE UM BETWEEN EACH HISTOGRAM
SO THAT IF THE X. M. L. UH YOU FEEL THERE IS NOT ENOUGH UM UH SHOTS YOU CAN INSTEAD OF REPROCESSING THE VIDEO YOU YOU REPROCESS THIS FILE
AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF S FOR INSTANCE ALPHA THRESHOLD WE TALKED ABOUT IS SET TO TWO POINT FOUR AND UH YEAH
SO THE UH THE THE STEP WE ALWAYS USE ONE AND IT SHOULD BE ONE BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S STUCK BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE FRAMES
YEAH BUT UH IT DOESN'T W YEAH IT IT'S BETTER TO TO KEEP IT ONE
YEAH
SO DETECTION LATENCY IS ABOUT THE UM IT'S HALF OF THE WINDOWS THA YEAH SLIDING WINDOW
OPTION FOR KEY FRAME EXTRACTION OKAY
UH SUB THRESHOLD YEAH
LEAVE IT TO ONE YEAH
UH YEAH
MAYBE I I WILL UH I WILL GIVE YOU THIS FILE IN UH AS A RHY IT'S A KIND OF RHYTHMIA YEAH
I JUST FOR PREPARING THIS UH NICE DISCUSSION
M UM I'M QUITE HAPPY TO TO TO DO THAT I IT'S GOOD WHEN YOU DO UH SOMETHING THAT THERE IS SOMEONE USING IT
BUT UH BUT
AT LEAST YEAH WITH THE INTERFACE IT'S QUITE FUNNY TO TO SEE UM D THAT THE Q QUICKLY YOU CAN DO SOMETHING IN IN YEAH
IN THIRTY T IF THE VIDEO I TEN IS TEN MINUTES IN THIRTY MINUTES 'CAUSE IT'S NO NOT A LOT OF THINGS TO CHANGE
OR EVEN IT CAN DO IT UH IT CAN WE CAN DO IT QUITE AUTOMATICALLY
IT CAN BE DONE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OH YEAH IT
SO THE REAL MEDIA IS UH YEAH A PARALLEL THING THAT FROM THE A. V. I. YOU CONVERT IT INTO REAL MEDIA AND IT IS DONE ON WINDOWS
UH
YEAH
MM THERE IS A A THE FREE ONE IS OKAY
YOU CAN USE THE FREE WE HAVE A LICENSE HERE AT IDIAP BUT UH THE IF YOU WANT TO PAY
YOU PAY FOR OPTIONS SUCH AS UH RESIZE OR CROPPING BUT IN FACT MAYBE WE DON'T NEED THAT AND UH IT'S CALLED ELIX PRODUCER
YEAH I FORGOT YEAH YEAH UH ELIX PRODUCER AND AND THAT'S IT
YOU CAN YOU CAN I IT IT I
YES
YEAH
UH YEAH
AND YEAH WITH REAL MEDIA
WELL THIS IS YOU CAN BUY OR YOU CAN ORDER FOR FREE ON INTERNET
NO NO NO NO FOR THE REAL MEDIA
AND UM YOU DIDN'T SEE BUT THE RE THE REAL MEDIA UM IS CALLED VIA A REAL SERVER
SO IT'S R. T. S. P. THE CONNECTION AND I IT'S STREAMING VIDEO STREAMING SO IT'S NOT H. T. T. P.
SO THAT IT CAN PLAY UH SMOOTHLY AND BUT WE ARE STILL UH INVESTIGATING FOR THE VIDEO FORMATS
BECAUSE UM I IT'S NOT SUPPORTED FOR INSTANCE UH UH IN JAVA IN JAVA APPLICATIONS UH ETCETERA
REAL MEDIA
YEAH
REAL MEDIA SO THERE ARE MANY ISSUES ABOUT THAT BUT YEAH
IT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM
YEAH
YEAH THAT WAS A SINGLE VIDEO STRUCTURING BUT IT'S UH OTHER LEVEL UH IT CAN UH IT'S QUITE UH IT'S RESEARCHED YEAH
YEAH
YEAH LAST THING UH THIS IS A KIND OF UH X. M. L. THAT IS OUTPUTTED
SO SO IT'S UH THE STRUCTURE IS SUCH AS UH VI VIDEO SEGMENTATION WITH UH VIDEOS IN BEGIN AND THEN FOR EACH SHOT YOU HAVE AN I. D. WELL THIS IS THE TERMS FROM M. PEG SEVEN CONVENTION
BUT ANYWAY
SHOT BEGIN AND END
UH A SH THE SHOT KEY FRAME THAT IS THE MIDDLE HERE
UH SUB SHOT
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
TWELVE FRAMES
AND IN FACT THAT'S WHAT I OUTPUT IN UH ON THE YEAH I THINK Y ON THE INTERFACE
AND THERE IS ONLY ONE SUB SHOT BECAUSE UH W YEAH
THERE WAS THERE WAS PROBLEMS WITH DETECTING THE SUB SHOTS ETCETERA
BUT UH YEAH WELL
YEAH I TR WELL UH NOT WITH THIS ONE BUT YEAH
I TRIED TO CODE SOME STUFF UH IT BUT UH I'M NOT SO CONFIDENT IN THE WAY UH IT IS UH CODED
YEAH
YEAH
BUT WE YEAH EVEN WE SHOULD UH FOR INSTANCE FOR THE VIDEOS UH FOR THE SPECTRAL CLUSTERING FOR THE CLUSTERING
HERE UH I STORE THE CONSECUTIVE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE HISTOGRAMS BUT WE COULD UH STORE THE MATRIX THAT'S YEAH
AND THEN UH YEAH
AND I THINK I THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE THINGS WITH UH SPECTRAL CLUSTERING
BUT BUT THE UH WITH UM THERE IS ONE PARAMETER THAT IS VERY C WHA I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IS THE PARAMETER UH
YEAH
NO NO NO NO THE IN THE THE GAP TO FIND THE THE GOOD NUMBER OF CLUSTERS IS SO SENSITIVE UH
YEAH ANYWAY
IT'S IT'S A BIT LATER IN THE IN THE REPORT
SO ANYTIMES YEAH I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TO TO HELP YOU WITH THAT
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN WE CAN GO
HMM
YES
MM 'KAY

YEAH YEAH
OH YEAH
THERE WAS SOME BURNING

NO
UH I HAVE LOOK AT THE DEMO FILM AND IT'S ABOUT UH
FORTY MINUTES AND ABOUT UH
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS SO IT'S YEAH
YES
AND UH I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A REAL SAMPLE D. V. D.
BECAUSE UH THIS WILL MAKE ABOUT UH FIVE SECONDS FOR EACH SHOT SO I THINK IT'S VERY SHORT
NO
I IF THIS IS TO R TO TO TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE COLOUR LIGHT AND UH THEY HAVE A LOT OF UH SHOTS
HMM
YEAH OKAY
AH OKAY
YEAH OKAY
OKAY UNDERSTAND
YEAH
OKAY

MM-HMM
MM
YES
SORRY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH UH I THINK I THINK THEY MADE SOME UH SPECIAL EFFECT IN THIS D. V. D.
UH THERE IS TWO OR THREE TIME UH YOU SEE YOU SEE THE SAME UH SAME KIND OF UH SCENE UH JUST UH TWO OR THREE SECONDS
YEAH
HMM
NO THERE'S NO MENU
THERE IS JUST ONE UH ONE CHAPTER AND NO MENU
YEAH YES
YES
UH
UH I THINK IN THE VIDEO THERE'S TWO THERE'S TWO VIDEO ONE IS A REAL VIDEO AND THE OTHER IS A JUST UH INTRODUCTION WHEN YOU HAVE THE MENU
NO IT'S UH THIRTEEN MINUTES
NO BUT YES THIS IS THE SAME BUT UH THERE WAS A PROBLEM WHEN DO THE GRAB FROM THE D. V. D. TO THE FILES
SO THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE MAKE TWO TWO FILES
BUT NOW I HAVE ONE FILE ALSO IN THE SO YOU CAN PROCESS AGAIN ONE TIME
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YES
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YES
HMM
HMM
HMM
YEAH
MM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
BUT THE THE NAME OF THE VIDEO FILE IS VIDEO NAME IS UH IT'S THE SAME AS A DIRECTORY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY YES OKAY
YEAH OKAY
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
MM
OKAY OKAY
SO EVERY EVERY FRAME ON THE F PAGE IS UH ONLINE
IS IS A
OKAY
YEAH
YES
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY UNDERSTAND
YES OKAY
OKAY
BUT ON THE ON THE ON THE SERVER THE ORIGINAL IS A F VIDEO FILM
OKAY
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN CHANGE YOU CAN CHANGE A NUMBER TO TAKE WHICH ONE OKAY
OKAY UNDERSTAND
IN THE OTHER YEAH YEAH
OKAY PERFECT
IN THIS ONE OKAY
YEAH I THINK IT'S NOT WELL DONE YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
BUT UM
YEAH
OKAY OKAY THERE IS LI LOCAL CACHE
OKAY OKAY
OKAY OKAY
OKAY
SO IF WE FOR EXAMPLE NOW WE HAVE THE C THE THE CASE THAT THIS VIDEO IS NOT CORRECT BECAUSE UH I HAVE MAKE UH EVENT GRABBING
SO UH WE NEED TO REMOVE THE CACHE FOR THIS VIDEO OR THIS IS AUTOMATIC
YEAH
YEAH BUT WHAT I MEAN IS I I I I I IF I IF I PUT THE SAME VIDEO WITH THE SAME NAME INSTEAD OF THIS ONE
THEY SHOULD UH DIFFERENT
AH OKAY
WE NEED TO REMOVE THEM
YEAH OKAY
OKAY UNDERSTAND
OKAY
YEAH IT'S NOT A REAL UH USI USAGE
OKAY
OKAY
YES UNDERSTAND
OKAY
YEAH
YES BEC BECAUSE THIS ONE I WAS UH

ON THE M. M. M. YEAH
MM
HMM
HMM
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
OH IT'S GREEK BUT UH OKAY
OKAY SO I IF YOU COME BACK NOW YOU
YEAH YEAH
OKAY BUT NOW YOU HAVE S YOU HAVE BOTH CACHE
YEAH OKAY
YES COMPUTER TOO YES TO UH BUT OKAY
BUT IT'S FAST
OKAY
YEAH UNDERSTAND
OKAY
OKAY
UH I JU JUST UH A QUESTION ON THE THE ORGANISATION OF THE M. M. M.
SO YOU DON'T HAVE UH A PART FOR SPECIFIC UH PROJECT
EVERY FOR EXAMPLE IF WE MAKE A LOT OF UH FILM UH FOR CINETIS UH ALL ARE ON THE TOP
I MEAN UH ALL THE FILM ARE Y YOU YOU DON'T HAVE A SEPARATION FOR THE FILM FOR CINETIS OR FOR THE PROJECT AND S
WELL YOU SAY VIDEO NAME EQUAL ALL ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
AH
OKAY
TO MAKE
OKAY
IF WE NEED TO MAKE SOME SPECIAL THING ON THE BROWSER IT'S T
OKAY
YEAH OKAY IT'S OKAY
OKAY GREAT
OKAY
MM
OKAY
WORK IN PROGRESS
YEAH
INPUT
NO
YEAH UH
MM
YEAH MAINLY THE T WEBPAGE OR FOR OUTPUT
YEAH
OKAY
AND ALL THESE UH FILE ARE ONLY UH INTERNAL
THIS MEAN UH IF I GO T ON UH C CINTETIS CINETIS UH
FROM OUTSIDE OF IDIAP WE CAN ACCESS THIS
WITH A PASSWORD OR
MM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY YES OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH OKAY
YEAH YES YEAH OKAY
OKAY
HMM
YEAH OKAY
UH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH I UNDERSTAND YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
RIGHT OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
HMM
OKAY
YEAH
YES
HMM
OKAY YEAH
HMM
YES
YEAH OKAY
AND THE CODE IS BASED ON OPEN C. V.
OH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
BHATTACHARYA OKAY AND SO ON OKAY
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
SO WE CAN FORGET TOSH AND UH USE UH INPUT SE THE INPUT READER FOR THE THE M. PEG WE CAN RE LO USE UH OPEN C. V.
OKAY
OKAY
HMM
IT'S GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
YES
OUTPUT HMM
UH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH OKAY
AH OKAY
OKAY
WE CAN SKIP SOME FRAMES
OKAY

OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY IT'S PERFECT
HMM
YES
YES
YES
YEAH
MM
YEAH THE THE BROWSER
HMM
HMM
YES
YES
UH SO JUST UH LAST QUESTION MAYBE UH SO THIS MAKES A X. M. L. FILE
OKAY
THIS IS THE THE PROGRAMME TO TO GENERATING THE X. M. L. FILE AND THE THE SHOT
AND UH WITH THE KAYAK YOU HAVE ONE PROBLEMS YOU DON'T HAVE THE REAL MEDIA SO THIS IS ANOTHER THING
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO YOU HAVE SOME SPECIAL TOOLS FROM UH FROM REAL MEDIA
OKAY
HMM
MM
OKAY
HMM
HMM OKAY OKAY
OKAY I HEARD IT
OKAY
BUT UH ANYWAY YOU NEED YOU NEED TO HAVE WINDOWS TO MAKE THESE
SO I WILL ASK YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE OKAY
OKAY OKAY UNDERSTAND
OKAY
BUT THIS IS THIS IS MADE BY A PROGRAMME DONE OUTSIDE IDIAP
OKAY
THIS IS YES RIGHT OKAY
THIS NOT UH IDIAP PROGRAMME
OKAY OKAY
HMM
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
MM
UM
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
OKAY
MM
OKAY
THANK YOU
OKAY
YES
I THINK FOR TEST I CAN TAKE THE REAL DEMO AND MAKE THE THE FULL PROCESSING
SO I WILL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
HMM
OKAY
MM OKAY
I HAVE SOME INFORMATIONS
OKAY
AND UH IN THIS IN THIS THE BEGIN AND END THE NUMBER IS THE FOR EXAMPLE THE END IS ZERO DOT TWELVE TWELVE IS UH THIS FRAME TOO YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
WHAT WHAT
OKAY
UH
OKAY
MM
JUST WHAT WHAT
HMM
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
IT'S OKAY
NO
YEP
UH YOU CAN BE SITTING HERE ITSELF AND DO THE PRESENTATION
NOW YOU NEED THE DIFFERENT METHOD FROM HOW FROM GAMMAS YOU CAN GENERATE THE POSTERIORS
OKAY
UH I WAS JUST UM LET'S TALK ABOUT LITTLE ABOUT THIS PRESENTATION ITSELF THE SLIDE NUMBER SIX
OKAY HOW YOU FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE CONTEXT OF THE WHOLE UTTERANCE
HOW IMPORTANT IT COULD BE
IS IT NOT A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU'RE HAVING LESS CONTEXT
INSTEAD OF HAVING CONTEXT FROM ONE TO CAPITAL D. WHICH IS FOR THE WHOLE UTTERANCE WHICH DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE IN GENERAL
SO WHAT IS A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU CAN CUT THE CONTEXT INSTEAD OF HAVING THE CONTEXT FROM
THAT'S RIGHT
MIGHT BE LEFT OR RIGHT EVERYTHING THERE BUT NOT THE WHOLE CONTEXT
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A FACT THAT WHEN YOU ARE HAVING ONE UTTERANCE
SO IT ONE UTTERANCES LINK UP FULL SENTENCE OR SOMETHING AND THERE MIGHT NOT BE MUCH BREAKS IN IT
SO IN THAT SENSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT YOU ARE GOING TOO MUCH IN THE PAST AND THEN YOU ARE TRYING TO COMPUTE SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT RELATED
MM-HMM
KIND OF LET'S SAY IDEA IS USUALLY HUNDRED MILLISECONDS OR ONE SECOND
YEAH NUMBERS IT MIGHT BE OKAY BECAUSE MOST OF THE SENTENCES MIGHT BE THREE SECONDS OR SOMETHING
YEAH
THAT M THAT MATCH OF CONTEXT TO COMPUTER COMMAS
MM-HMM
OKAY SO WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM THEN MY STORY THEY ARE THE WORST I THINK
YEAH
I CANNOT GENERATE POSTERIORS
SO THERE IS
I DON'T HAVE THE C. FILES ALSO PRESENTLY WITH ME
YEAH
NO
MY SAID THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
YEAH AND THEN I THEN I WOULD HAVE TAKEN TWO YEARS EXTENSION
YEAH IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY SCARY BUT LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
ICSI MM-HMM
BECAUSE EVEN UM PETR HAS LOST A LOT
HE'S HAVING ONLY THE RESULTS WITH HIM
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE FILES THE REAL THE REAL S ONES
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE EVEN TO DOWNLOAD THAT MUCH OF DATA
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GET THE L. P. P. L. P. FEATURES AND
OKAY
BECAUSE THO THOSE FILES ARE ALSO VERY BIG THEY ARE NOT SINGLE FILES
SO THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY BREAK
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH P. L. P. NUMBERS NINETY FIVE DATABASE IS THERE FINE
YEAH
EVERYTHING IS LOST
AND UH IF IF YOU REALLY ASK ME EVEN THE STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THERE REAL EVERY POINT BY POINT HOW P. L. P. IS WELL GENERATED
THAT INFORMATION IS ALSO NOT THERE
YEAH BUT THE PARAMETERS WHICH ARE EXACT
HOPEFULLY NINETY FIVE PERCENT I KNOW BUT THAT FIVE PERCENT
AND THEN WE WE NEED TO TRAIN THE NEW RATES BECAUSE M. L. P. TRAINING NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THEN ONLY THE NEXT STEP WILL HAPPEN
SO IT'S IT'S PRETTY PRETTY HOL HOLDING IS STUPID
WHETHER WE CAN REPLICATE THE RESULTS WHATEVER RESULTS YOU ARE SHOWING WHETHER WE CAN REPLICATE THEM OR NOT
PRESENTLY IT'S IT'S NOT KNOWN
YEAH
YOU
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO NO NO NO HE IS USING DIFFERENT SETUP I THINK
HE DOESN'T USE OUR SETUP
DO YOU USE OUR SETUP FOR THE NUMBER OF STATES
FOR THE GAMMA ESTIMATION
OKAY MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO NO THOSE THINGS I'M ALSO HAVING BECAUSE THEY WERE DONE TWO YEARS BACK
ANYTHING WHICH IS DONE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IS THE ONE WHICH IS
NOTHING
THE THERE'S ALSO IN COM COM DATABASE YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
NO TH THOSE THINGS ARE NOT DISTURBED
NOTHING RELATED TO THE DATABASE HAS BEEN DISTURBED
EXCEPT THE SWITCHBOARD
NO THEY'RE THERE
NO NO IT WAS IT WAS PRE WRITTEN THERE
IT'S IN THE DATABASE ITSELF
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
YEAH SO IT THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM
NO I DIDN'T DO IT MYSELF
NO NO NO
MEANS AT L YEAH THAT PART IS LESS UH SCARY
YEAH
SO THE THINGS WHICH ARE RELATED TO YOUR P. L. P. CAN BE DONE I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT SUCH A MAJOR PROBLEM
SO YOU THA M. L. P. NEEDS TO BE TRAINED AND UH P. L. P. FEATURES
SO IT'S KIND OF ONE AND A HALF DAYS WORK KIND OF TO GENERATE THE NEW FILES
YEAH THAT WILL AGA MEANS IT'LL LIGHT UP THAT'S IT
BUT ALL ALL OF IT IS DOABLE IN THREE FOUR DAYS TIME
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
AND IF I DON'T HAVE TO GENERATE ANY NEW RESULTS I'M ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE THEN
BUT IF I NEED TO GENERATE NEW RESULTS THEN AND ANYWAY THERE IS EMOTIONAL LOSS SO SCRIPTS AND CODE EVERYTHING WRITTEN THAT IS
NO
YEAH YEAH
BECAUSE IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MEANS LOSSES ARE EMOTIONAL AS WELL AS WHATEVER IT IS THERE
AND BLA BLA BUT IT'S TRAGEDY
SO
SO RAID FIVE YOU HAVE TOLD TO THE
MM-HMM
NO ONE DISK THERE IS NO PROBLEM
MM-HMM OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
WAS IT INSURED ANY IDEA
NO NO INSURANCE CAN TAKE CARE OF UH MEANS ANYTHING CAN BE INSURED IN THIS WORLD NOWADAYS
MM-HMM
BUT IT STILL MEANS ONE THING WHICH IS A MYSTERY TO ME WHE WHY TEMP ONE AND TEMP TWO WERE RESIDING ON THE SAME HARD DISK PHYSICAL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH SO IT MEANS
SO THAT
MM-HMM
NO NO NO WHAT I'M SAYING MEANS TEMP ONE AND TEMP TWO COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ALTOGETHER
I'M SAYING THEY COULD HAVE KEPT DIFFERENTLY
NO RAID ON BOTH THEY SYSTEMS WAS THE PROBLEM
HARD DISK THERE THERE WERE ALREADY FIVE HARD DISKS RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE SCARED OF TEMPS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO NO NO NO NO
NO NO NO
I CHECKED OVER THE NET IT'S NOT THE WAY
YOU D YOU SEND THE THINGS TO THEM THEY WILL SEE IF THEY CAN RECOVER
THEN ONLY THEY'LL ASK YOU THAT THIS IS THE QUOTATION
BUT IF THERE IS NO NO IF THEY CANNOT RECOVER THEY THEY WILL SEND IT BACK
MM-HMM
NO NO NO FIRST THEY'LL GIVE YOU A QUOTATION
THE THEY WON'T GO WE HO WITHOUT THAT
IT'S NOT MEANS IT'S A WRONG INFORMATION
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING WHAT THEY SAY THAT SEND US THE THING WE'LL LOOK AT THE THINGS
IF IT IS RECOVERABLE WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS THE QUOTATION AND IF IT IS NOT RECOVERABLE WE WILL SEND IT BACK TO YOU
BUT MEANS F AND UH I IF THEY THEY CANNOT RECOVER IT THEN THEN WHAT THEY WILL THEY WON'T CHARGE ANYTHING FROM YOU FOR THE INSPECTION
BUT
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
MEANS LOOKING AT UH HOW MUCH FAILURE HAS HAPPENED
ACCORDINGLY THEY WILL TELL YOU WHETHER THEY CAN RECOVER OR NOT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO HOW MUCH IS FOUR TERA FOUR THOUSAND GIGABYTES
OKAY
NOT MUCH
IS IT RAID ONE HAS MORE COMPARED TO RAID FIVE
NO RAID ONE IS HAVING EXACTLY F FIFTY PERCENT CAPACITY IS UTILISED
IT'S COPY
TWO COPIES OF THE SAME THING WILL BE EXISTING
THAT IS A RAID ONE
THAT'S RIGHT
RAID FIVE IS TWENTY PERCENT
NO
SO RAID ONE IS EXACTLY IT'S MEANS THAT'S LOT OF WASTAGE OF RESOURCES BUT IT'S MORE TOLERANT
AND THERE IS NO KIND OF OR ANYTHING NOTHING EXISTS THERE
SO THE DISK WHICH HAS CRASHED THAT CANNOT BE RECOVERED
THAT UH DISK WHICH HAS NOT CRASHED IT CAN BE RECOVERED COMPLETELY
MEANS IF BOTH THE DISK HAVE CRASHED FOR THE SAME DATA YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANYTHING
IF ONE DISK HAS CRASHED CRASHED THEN YOU CAN RECOVER EVERYTHING
YEAH IT'LL BE IN THE OTHER DISK
SO THAT IS RAID ONE
IF YOU ARE GIVEN A CHOICE YOU WANT TO TAKE RAID ONE OR RAID FIVE OR A SIMPLE LAPTOP
MM-HMM
TO WHAT ARE THE EXPERIMENTS YOU NEED TO DO
WHAT ARE THE NEW EXPERIMENTS YOU ARE HAVING IN YOUR MIND
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT DO YOU FEEL THAT IS PAPER MATERIAL
BUT THE ONE WHICH YOU HAVE REPORTED MEANS YOU WANT TO REPORT SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
AH OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO MIGHT BE WHAT I CAN DO I CAN GIVE YOU THE SETUP AND YOU CAN YOU CAN GENERATE FROM BOTTOM TRAIN M. L. P. TEST M. L. P.
MM I WAS USING THIRTY NINE YES
MM-HMM MM-HMM
SO WHAT IS THIS RESULT
THIS IS RELATED TO YOUR UM M. L. M. I.
AH OKAY MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WHAT IS A TRIPHONE GAMMAS
AH OKAY
YOUR YOUR M. L. P.
OKAY
BUT THOSE GAMMAS WILL BE SAME AS UH S NORMALISED SCALE LIKELIHOODS RIGHT
THEN THE THEY'RE THROUGH THAT DATA UH FROM THROUGH
OKAY
UH NOT UH SCALE LIKELIHOODS
POSTERIORS
FROM
G. M. M. OH M. L. P. SCALE LIKELIHOODS
YOU'RE YOU ARE HAVING POSTERIORS THERE RIGHT
YOU DIVIDED BY THE
OKAY
OKAY SO IT'S SCALE LIKELIHOODS
OKAY
AND FULL NETWORK WHAT WAS THE R CH ARCHITECTURE
AH OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DISCUSS
ONE DAY AFTER THE CRASH
YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'S ALL BE BECAUSE OF YOU
YOU CAME ON WRONG DAY FROM IRAN
YOU SHOULD HAD COME ON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY
ANYWAY
UH THEY'LL GET A SHOCK OF THEIR LIFE
MIGHT BE THE ONE KIND OF LIKE IF THEY HAVE READ THEIR MAILS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH EVERYTHING IS LOST YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT'S A MAJOR LOSS NO DOUBT
THE DATA ON WHICH WE WANT TO RUN THE SCRIPTS IS NOT THERE
IF THEY CAN YEAH IF THEY CAN GIVE ME MY C. FILES THEN ALSO IT'S OKAY
YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T NEED TO GENERATE FEATURES ALSO YEAH
YEAH IT'S AMAZING
I N I DON'T NEED ALL MY P. FILES JUST THREE OF THEM
YEAH
NOWADAYS IT'S NOT THE CASE
THEY PHYSICALLY ALSO SEPARATE THE THINGS
OR IT'S SPRINKLERS
THEN WHAT IF THEIR SPRINKLERS DON'T WORK
AH
UH-HUH
YEAH
THEY WON'T KEEP IT AT ONE PLACE YEAH
PHYSICALLY AT DIFFERENT PLACES YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
C. D. S ARE NOT ENOUGH THAT'S THE PROBLEM
BECAUSE ONE C. D. IS HOW MUCH
IT'S NOT EVEN ONE G. B.
SO THEN C. D. S ARE NOT ENOUGH
MM-HMM
HMM
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DATAS OR YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
OKAY MM-HMM
I DON'T KNOW
NO NO HE WA HE WAS HAVING LOCKED MANY THINGS IN THE PROPER PLACES
BUT IN TEMP HE WASN'T HAVING LOT OF IMPORTANT THINGS YEAH
ALL THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HE WAS RUNNING
MM-HMM
UH LOOK WHAT
BUT WHAT WE'LL DO WITH THE SWITCHES
NO NO NO NO NO
OKAY THAT WAY IT MIGHT BE BUT THE SITUATION IS THAT UH HE HE WAS GENERATING HIS OWN P. L. P. FEATURES FROM HIS OWN SCRIPTS
HE WAS NOT USING USING DOCTOR SPEECH
YEAH
SO HE WAS LIKE UH HE WAS SO I'D BORROWED FEW OF THE THINGS FROM HIM
THE F. F. T. ROUTINE AND UH READING THE SIGNAL WAVE FORM
THESE THINGS I BORROWED FROM HIM AND I CHANGED AND THEN I PUT IT IN MY ALL PROGRAMMES SO
I I KEPT THE BACKUPS BUT THOSE BACKUPS ARE THE THEM'S ALSO ON TEMP
I DIDN'T I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS THIS WAY IT CAN CRASH BECAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE I CAN DO A MISTAKE AND WIPE OUT THE THINGS
AND THEN THERE IS NO BACKUP
SO I CANNOT BLAME ANYBODY BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE WHOLE BACKUP CAN ITSELF CRASH
YEAH
SO NOW IN IN MY LIFE I WILL NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING WHICH IS TEMP
WHETHER IT IS TEMPERATURE OR WHETHER IT IS TEMPORARY
BECAUSE JUST FEW FEW DAYS BACK I TOOK A BACKUP OF MY LAPTOP FEARING THE SAME THING
BUT THEN I DIDN'T REALISE THAT I SHOULD TAKE A BACKUP OF
P. L. P. IS HARDLY ANYTHING YEAH
AH
FROM POSTERIORS TO S FORCED ALIGNMENT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THREE YEARS TWO TO THREE YEARS YEAH
NOT IN ALL CASES THAT'S THE PROBLEM WHICH PEOPLE ARE FACING
BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS WRITTEN THEN AND THERE ITSELF
MEANS EVEN IF THE OPTIMISATION HAS BEEN DONE THEY DID THE OPTIMISATION THERE AND THEY THEY WORKED ON THAT STARTED WORKING ON THAT
THEY DIDN'T WRITE IT WITH PEN OR SOMETHING ON A PAPER OR SAYING THAT OKAY THIS IS THE BEST OPTIMISATION
YEAH
BECAUSE IF I CHANGE MY CONFIGURATION AND YOUR RESULTS ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE
OKAY
SO HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE SPENT
OKAY SO THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH
YEAH
OKAY THANK YOU
HAVE A GOOD DAY
OKAY
OKAY SO SHOULD I START
OKAY
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER TO FIRST HAVE A PRESENTATION OF MY WORK AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS UH WITH THIS CRASH IN TEMP IN TEMP UH WHAT WE CAN DO UH FOR MY FUTURE TO TO CONTINUE MY RESEARCH
BECAUSE APPARENTLY I I WILL HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OKAY
SO I WILL START WITH THE PRESENTATION OF MY WORK
MM
OKAY
I START LIKE THIS THEN
OKAY SO IT'S UH MY G WORK IS GENERALLY ABOUT UH USING POSTERIORS IN UH SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS AND UH SOMEHOW ENHANCING THE ESTIMATION OF POSTERIORS
GETTING NEW POSTERIORS WHICH ARE HAVI WHICH ARE MORE INFORMATIVE BY SOMEHOW INTEGRATING SOME EXTRA KNOWLEDGE LIKE UH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PROBLEM AND THEN USE THIS POSTERIOR ESTIMATION UH UH METHOD UH FOR DESIGNING HIERARCHICAL UH SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM
SO IN THIS HIERARCHICAL ARG ARCHITECTURE I WILL BE ABLE TO UH INTEGRATE THE EXTRA KNOWLEDGE AT THE PROPER LEVEL OF HIERARCHY
AND I WILL BE AL ALSO UH ABLE TO UH COMBINE DIFFERENT KIND OF UH KNOWLEDGE OR SOURCES UH SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE I HAVE
UH WELL AS YOU KNOW UH GENERALLY POSTERIORS ARE ESTIMATED USING UH NEURAL NETWORKS AND MORE SPECIFICALLY M. L. P. S IN A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM
SO UH TIME LIMITED WINDOW OF A SPEECH SIGNAL IS UH REPRESENTED BY SOME CEPSTRAL FEATURES
WHICH ARE THEN PROCESSED BY AN M. L. P. AND IT GIVES US SOME EVIDENCE AS IN THE FORM OF POS PHONE POSTERIORS
THEN WE USE THESE PHONE POSTERIORS AS FEATURES OR AS SCORES FOR FOR EITHER JUST DECODING OR D UH UH N D TRAINING AND INFERENCE TRAINING AND THEN DECODING
UH BUT WE KNOW THAT UH IN THIS UH IN THIS CASE WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION UH UH LINE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION
AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO INTEGRATE THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE WE CAN HAVE ABOUT PHONE USE OR ABOUT
UH WORDS IN THE POSTERIOR ESTIMATION SO THE MAIN MOTIVATION IS TO SEE IF WE CAN INTEGRATE THIS KIND OF EXTRA KNOWLEDGE IN THE POSTERIOR ESTIMATION
SO WHAT IS PROPOSED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS TO USE A UH WHAT WE FORMALLY USE IN H. M. M. FORMALISM WHICH IS CALLED GAMMA UH STATE POSTERIOR
UH I UH AS A POSTERIOR FOR UH TRAINING UH OR DECODING SO IT'S UH WELL AS YOU KNOW IT'S A STATE POSTERIOR PROBABLILITY IN A H. M. M.
WHICH IS DEFINED AS THE PROBABILITY OF BEING IN A SPECIFIC H. M. M. STATE AT A SPECIFIC TIME HAVING THE WHOLE OBSERVATION SEQUENCE AND THE MODEL
SO WHOLE OBSERVATION SEQUENCE MEANS HAVING COMPLETE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION AND THE MOD UH AND THE MODEL CAN ENCODE SOME KIND OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE FOR US BY MEANS OF UH TOPOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS
UH WELL YOU KNOW IT'S UH THIS GAM UH GAMMA POSTERIOR IS WRITTEN IN TERMS OF FORWARD AND BACKWARD H. M. M. RECURSIONS
AND ACTUALLY ONE WAY TO USE THIS UH GAMMA POSTERIORS IS UH USING THESE POSTERIORS AS SOME KIND OF NEWER SCORES FOR DECODING
SO IN THIS CASE IT WILL BE UH SIMILAR TO HYBRID METHOD
UM THE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE DO ONE MORE STEP UH MAYBE I CAN EXPLAIN IT BETTER THERE
SO WE DO ONE MORE STEP HERE AND WE UH HERE BY MEANS OF ANOTHER H. M. M. WE INTRODUCE SOME KIND OF UH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION
WE GET BETTER EVIDENCES THAN WHAT I WE INITIALLY HAD HERE
AND THEN WE DO THE UH DECODING AND THE AND S MORE INFORMATIVE POSTERIORS UH UH INSTEAD OF THIS ONE
SO WE ARE EXPECTING TO UH THE SYSTEM TO PERFORM BETTER AND MORE ROBUST TO NOISY CASES
HERE YOU SEE UH SOME RESULTS UH AND HOW UH HOW WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF INTRODUCING UH REASONABLE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
SO DIFFERENT UH ROWS IN THIS TABLE ARE SHOWING DIFFERENT LEVEL OF NOISE AND ALSO CLEAN SPEECH AND DIFFERENT COLUMNS ARE SHOWING DIFFERENT KIND OF POSTERIORS OR GAMMA POSTERIORS
SO UH THE THE FIRST COLUMN IS SHOWING THE UH OUR BASELINE SYSTEM
WHICH IS GETTING ESTIMATE OF POSTERIORS OUT OF M. L. P. UH AND THEN D USING THESE POSTERIORS FOR DECODING
AND THE OTHER COLUMNS ARE SHOWING THE PERFORMANCE OF UH DIFFERENT KIND OF GAMMA
SO UH GAMMA WHICH IS ESTIMATED USING UH INFORMATION ABOUT MINIMUM DURATION OF PHONEMES ABOUT
POSSIBLE TRANSITION BETWEEN PHONEMES AND SOME KIND SOME UH MORE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE LIKE UH WHICH WO LIKE UH WHICH WORD IS COMPOSED OF WHICH PHONEMES AND UH G UH GRAM GRAMMATICAL KNOWLEDGE AB UH ABOUT TRANSITION BETWEEN WORDS AND THINGS LIKE THIS
SO AS YOU SEE INTRODUCING MORE REASONABLE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE UM WILL H HELP TO HAVE BETTER PERFORMANCE IN ALMO IN ALMOST ALL THE CASES
AND HERE I COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE GAMMA BASE SYSTEM WITH THE STANDARD H. M. M. G. M. M. SYSTEM
WHICH IS BASED ON UH DOING DECODING UH USING UH LIKELIHOOD AS THE SCORES
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT OUR SYSTEM USE UH IS USING POSTERIORS FOR DECODING
SO AS YOU SEE S UH IT'S WORKING UH BETTER THAN THE STANDARD H. M. M. G. M. M. SYSTEM
AND FINALLY THE CONCLUSION IS UH HE HERE WE SAW HOW WE CAN GET UH SOME MORE INFORMATIVE POSTERIORS BY INTRODUCING EXTRA KNOWLEDGE LIKE PRIOR AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION
AND THEN USING THIS UH UH P POSTERIOR ESTIMATION METHOD TO DESIGN HIERARCHICAL UH SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM WHICH WE'RE WHICH WHICH THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A BETTER
MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE ROBUST SYSTEM
SO IF YOU WANT NOW WE CAN DISCUSS ABOUT UM UH THE CRASH AND THE LOSS OF DATA
SO UH WELL I LOST ALL THE POSTERIORS I WAS I UH I USED AS INPUT UH FOR MY SYSTEM
SO THE GAMMA ARE SOMEHOW ESTIMATED OR COMPUTED ON TOP OF POSTERIORS
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY POSTERIOR AND UH PROBABLY THE SCRIPTS GENERATING THAT POSTERIOR SO WHAT I CAN DO OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
GAMMA FULL MODEL BUT UH WHAT ABOUT OTHER ONES AND WHAT ABOUT THE F POSTERIOR BECAUSE BECAUSE I I UH YOU KNOW
I CANNOT UH STOP MY RESEA I I MAY DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW IN FUTURE WITH THIS UH AND WELL I NEED POSTERIORS TO
YEAH
UH NO NO I DON'T HAVE THEM THERE WERE ALL UNDER TEMP
YOU YOU WE HAVE THAT BECAUSE YOU UH STORED THEM
SO
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE MAYBE SOME OTHER M UH P. H. D. STUDENT SHOULD BE HIRED TO WORK ON YOU KNOW THE GENERATING GAMMA
SIX OKAY
LESS CONTEXT WHAT YOU MEAN
UH
YES
YEAH
YOU MEAN A SMALLER CONTEXT INSTEAD OF THIS
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
YES
YEAH
YEAH B WELL EVEN THEY CAN HAVE SOME INFORMATION WHICH ARE NOT SO MEANINGFUL OR UH WHICH ARE NOT RELATED
YEAH WELL BUT THEN I WILL HAVE THE PROBLEM TO FIND THE OPTIMUM AMOUNT OF CONTEXT
HOW MUCH CONTEXT SHOULD I TAKE
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
THAT'S REASONABLE
MM
YEAH
YEAH
AND AND YOU DON'T HAVE UH SCRIPTS FOR
AH OKAY YOU DO YOU HAVE JUST YOUR NO
AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE YOUR
MM
YES
N YEAH I UH FOR C. T. S. PETR UH STILL I THINK HAVE HE DIDN'T UH LOSE ANYTHING SO
AH
OKAY
MM
MM JUST UH PO UH PI UH POSTERIOR ESTIMATED USING P. L. P. FEATURES FOR NUMBER WHICH I THINK WE CAN WE CAN RATE IT
UH P. L. P. THEY'RE ALSO LAST
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YES
UH NOWADAYS NOT THAT ONE
THERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR UH VERIFYING THESE RESULTS BECAUSE WELL FOR THESE RESULTS YOU KNOW
THE THE CONFIGURATION SHOULD NOT WELL I ALSO SAVED THE CONFIGURATION SOMEWHERE IN THE TEMP
SO EXACTLY HOW MANY STAYS FOR DECODING AND WHICH KIND OF LANGUAGE MODEL AND THINGS LIKE THIS
I I THINK I CAN REMEMBER ALMOST ALL OF THEM BUT F IT'S IT'S A BIT UH UH STRESSFUL
YEAH BUT H HE DOESN'T
UH Y M YES
LOST
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH SO SO AS THE CONCLUSION THERE IS NO MAJOR PROBLEM EXCEPT REGENERA YEAH WHICH TIME FOR I GUESS
MM
MM
MM
MM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM
WELL I ALSO HAD THE OF GENERATED POSTERIORS OR GAMMAS OR THINGS LIKE THIS WHICH I SHOULD REGENERATE
I HAVE THE UH SCRIPTS BUT UH WELL IT TAKES TIME IT'S C. P. U. AND REGENERATING ALL THESE THINGS BUT OKAY IT'S OKAY
SO THERE IS NO MAJOR PROBLEM EXCEPT TIME
DEADLINE OF TWO WEEKS FOR ICAS
OKAY
HMM
HMM
T
AH
WELL I I THINK W AFTER THIS MEETING WE CAN T WE CAN TRY TOGETHER TO REGENERATE THIS
WELL UH P. L. P. S I THINK TH THEY SHOULD BE FIRST REGENERATED THEN POSTERIORS AND IF BY THE END OF WEEK WE COULD HAVE POSTERIORS
THEN IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT I CAN EASILY REGENERATE THE GAMMAS AND DO ALL THE EXPERIMENTS AGAIN
MAYBE IT'S A
UH MAINLY TH THERE WOULD BE SOME EXPERIMENT TO CHECK HOW THE SYSTEM IS ROBUST AGAINST THESE UH TUNING FACTORS LIKE UH LANGUAGE MOD UH LANGUAGE MODELLING
SCALING FACTOR LANGUAGE SCALING FACTOR AND INVERSION PENALTY
THIS WILL BE THE MAIN NEW ISSUE AND UH WELL
YEAH THE NEW THING IN THE PAPER AND WELL SOME
NO IN THESE CASES BUT
WELL ACTUALLY ACTUALLY THIS W THIS WAS NOT IN THE PAPER
I PUT IT IN THE PRESENTATION BUT IT'S NOT IN THE PAPER
UH THE PAPER WAS JUST FOR CLEAN SPEECH BUT SINCE I HAD THE RESULTS BEFORE AND I CANNOT COPY THESE THINGS
BECAUSE I T UH I TALKED WITH HERVE AND HE SAID OKAY
ACTUALLY THE NUMBERS ARE NOT UH VERY REASONABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST THIRTEEN P. L. P. FEATURES AND UH WE HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST SOMETHING WHICH IS KNOWN FOR PEOPLE
I MEAN THEY ARE EXPECTING SOMETHING AROUND NINETY EIGHTY SEVEN OR UH SOMETHING LIKE THIS
UH SO I ANYWAY I HAD TO RE TO REDO ALL THE EXPERIMENTS BUT NOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT
BECAUSE BEFORE I HAD POSTERIORS AND NOW WE HAVE TWO MORE STEPS P. L. P. S AND AND AND POSTERIORS SO
YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU VERY MUCH UH
OH M I WANTED I WANTED TO EXTEND THIS UH WELL ACTUALLY THE PAPER WE WANTED TO WRITE WAS UH FOR ICAS WAS SOMETHING RELATED TO MULTI STREAM GAMMA
BUT OKAY OKAY
UH WILL I I WILL EXPLAIN
SO THA MY PLAN WAS TO HAVE TWO STREAMS AND I I I WELL
YEAH
I SO I I THOUGHT THAT OKAY I ONE STREAM WILL BE P. L. P. AND THE OTHER WILL BE DELTA P. L. P. S
SO THIS WAS ONE PART OF EXPERIMENT SO SINGLE STREAM AND THEN I WANTED TO COMBINE DELTAS WITH THIS AND HAVE ANOTHER TABLE SO THAT WAS WHY
BUT ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS AND THE STUDY IS NOT SH I IT'S NOT SHOWING UH STRONG RESULTS
ANYWAY RESULTS ARE NOT VERY IMPORTANT BUT THEY SHOULD BE WITHIN A RANGE OF UH ACCEPTABLE NUMBERS
SO THEN UH FOR NOW I THINK IT'S BETTER TO INSTEAD OF DOING P. L. P. AND DELTA P. L. P.
I CAN UH HAVE SINGLE STREAM OF THIRTY NINE P. L. P. S AND THEN COMBINE THEM WITH TRAPS JUST TO HAVE
YEAH THIRTY NINE
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
NO NO IT'S INTERSPEECH
THE OKAY
THESE NUMBERS ARE FULL P. L. P. THIRTY NINE OKAY
BUT JUST TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR IN THE PRESENTATION TO SHOW MORE STEPS
TRY YEAH
YEAH YEAH
EVEN
EVEN IF YOU
NO
TH
YEAH
IT'S AMAZING THAT EVERYTHING WAS UNDER TEMP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SILEYE WILL BE BACK AND HE'S NOT IN VACATION BUT HE'S IN ITALY
HE FLIES TO SENEGAL DIRECTLY
MM
MM
AND WHAT IF WE HAVE SOME DAY A FIRE IN IDIAP WE WILL LOSE ALL THE DATA
MM I MEAN BUT THEY HAVE WELL I I THINK W THEY CAN AND YEAH THEY CAN D YOU KNOW STORE IT SOMEWHERE
BUT YOU KNOW HERE WE CAN EASILY HAVE A FIRE BECAUSE THE EVERYTHING IS MADE OF WOOD I THINK AND IT'S SMALL AND
ANYWAY THE GOOD THE CONCLUSION IS TO HAVE A BACK UP AND UH AND C. D. AT HOME
MM
YEAH
HMM
MM
HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
REVERSE
OKAY
THANK YOU THANK YOU
YOU TOO
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN GO BACK UP TO THE FEATURE YOU KNOW
UP TO
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH YOU CAN THEN YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF MOST DID IT ON WHAT NUMBERS AND ONE OF COUPLE OF C. T. F. EXPERIMENTS RIGHT
NO NO NO NO NO I UH PROBABLY MIGHT
UH
YEAH BUT THE WAVE FILE IS TH THAT'S IN THE TEMP ONLY RIGHT
SO SO THE ONLY THING IS THAT I CAN RECOVER IT BACK FROM BERKELEY
NO EVERYTHING WE W IF TH IF THEY SAY THAT WE CANNOT RECOVER IT THEN I CAN QUICKLY GET IT BACK FROM ICSI IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
I CAN PUT ALL THE SYSTEM BACK HERE
BUT UH
MM YEAH
YEAH A LOT OF TIME NO IT I CAN DOW OBVIOUSLY DOWNLOADING IS ANOTHER THING
THE ONLY THING IS THAT I HAVE TO DO IS THAT THEY HAVE UH DATA IN UH ONE PARTICULAR STRUCTURE
SO I HAVE TO FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW ORGANISE CREATE TAR FILES AND THEN I CAN GET IT BACK HERE
YEAH THAT I CAN GET ALL THOSE THINGS
ALL TH ALL THOSE M YEAH
YEAH BUT THE THOSE FILES CAN BE RECOVERED EASILY ONLY THING IS THAT UH NOW IF THEY HAD TO SAY THAT WE CANNOT RECOVER IT
UH UH ONE UH ONE UH DAY ONE O ONE TWO DAYS LIKE THIS WEEK I CAN WAIT AND SEE
IF THEY CANNOT RECOVER IT THEN I CAN JUST GET ALL THE DATA FROM ICSI AND PUT BACK THE C. T. S. SYSTEM
NO WE CANNOT DO
YEAH
EVERYTHING THAT
ONE ONE
NO NO BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE DOWN IN THE DATABASE SECTION
YEAH EXCEPT SWITCHBOARD BUT THE SWITCHBOARD ALSO WE HAVE IT BUT ONLY THING IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA WE NEED YEAH
NO NO IT IS DEAD
BECAUSE IT WAS THAT NOW
NO NO IT W O ORI ORIGINALLY DONE
NO NO IT IS EVEN IN D. V. D. FORM WE HAVE IT THAT THE
NO EXCEPT UH EXCEPT TIME
HOW MUCH TIME WE WANT TO SPEND AGAIN TO GET
YEAH IT'S
MM
MM-HMM
THEY ARE THEY'RE IT'S IT'S IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU GET THREE DISK GONE
THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET IT WELL LIKE FINE IF IT'S ONE DISK IT'S FINE BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE IS HAVING THE UH MIRROR MIRROR
SO IT WILL RECACHE ON THE MIRROR
UM BUT UH IF THE THREE DISK ARE GONE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WENT LIKE USUALLY WHILE AS SOON AS ONE DISK FAILS IT SHOULD BE REPLACED ACTUALLY AND UH I DUNNO
MAYB YEAH OTHERWISE IT UH IT'LL GO ON DESTROYING OTHER DISKS
SO I SO THE ONE SO THEY I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPEN YOU KNOW SUCH A THING LIKE USUALLY AS SOON AS ONE FAILS
IT ACTUALLY NOTIFIES THE YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR OR MAKES CERTAIN KIND OF UM NOISE
UH YEAH TO TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW IT HAS TO BE REPLACED
SO W UH IF IT THE DISK IS NOT REPLACED THEN IT W IT'LL FAIL
IT UH THEN THEN IT UH THERE'S A INTERNAL RECOVERY IF IT JUST R REPLACE THE DISK THERE
IT'S IT IT CAN INTERNALLY IT CAN QUICKLY RECOVER EVERYTHING INTO THAT DISK
UH SO SO IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A MM MM UH UM IF YOU HAVE
IT'S KIND OF LIKE ESSENTIALLY IF IT IS LIKE HUNDRED TWENTY HUNDRED HUNDRED G. B. DATA SPACE
THEN IT ESSENTIALLY WILL HAVE A HUN TWO HUNDRED G. B. ONLY STU VISIBLE DATA F TO YOU
BUT THEN IT CAN WE AS SOON AS THEY REPLACE ONE OF THOSE HARD DISK I IT CAN IT CAN FROM THE OTHER ONE IT CAN RECOVER EVERYTHING ON THAT
INTER INTERNALLY IT CAN DO THAT KIND OF THING BUT IF THE TH IF THE THREE DISKS FAIL
THEN IT'S IT'S IT'S YEAH A REALLY DIFFICULT JOB I DON'T KNOW HOW IT CAN BE RECOVERED
PROBABLY THE MM ONE WAY THAT THEY EXTEND THE HAR THE HARD DISK TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS
AND THEY DO LIKE SECTOR BY SECTOR BLOCK BY BLOCK THEY TRY TO RECOVER
BUT THAT'S IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE
UH TH SIMPLE YES THE SIMPLE THING MIGHT COST YOU MINIMUM TEN THOUSAND EUROS FIFTEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS INSURED
I DON'T THINK INSURANCE COMPANY WILL GIVE
MM-HMM
NO IT DOES BECAUSE IT WAS NOT TEMP ONE TEMP TWO BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME MM IT HAS THREE G. B. THREE DISKS HARD DISK CATEGORY
AND SO YOU CAN GO UP TO FOURTEEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT CAN BE ON THE SAME YEAH
BUT SO IT TRIES TO PUT IF YOU IT TRIES TO UH QUICKLY PUT THINGS UH IF THIS WAY THAT SO THAT AND BUT ONLY THING THAT ONLY ONE HAS THE MM UM BACKUP
KEEP TAKING UP THE BACKUP THERE
SO IT PUTS EVERYTHING MM QUICKLY IT CAN DECIDE WHEREVER IT WANTS TO PUT SO IT'S FASTER TO DO THAT WAY
MM
NO I THINK THAT UH SOFT NAME THEY WERE GIVEN THE
YEAH
BUT THEN WHAT ARE THE USE OF RAID THEN
NO BUT THAT IS WHAT THE RAID CAN ALLOW YOU TO HAVE KEEP UP TO FOURTEEN HARD DISK
IT CAN ALLOW
YEAH SO IT THEY HAVE FIVE AND YOU CAN GO UP TO FOURTEEN IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THERE
AND IT CAN STILL WORK AND IT TAKES THE AND THE WAY IT LOOK LIKE IT IT'S STILL TOLERANT YOU KNOW
THE WAY IT IT USUALLY IT DOES IT IF YOU ONE THIS CRASHES BEFORE UH I UH UM IF IT UH REPLACE QUICKLY THEN NO PROBLEMS
OTHERWISE UNSAVED DATA WILL START THE FIRST THING IS TO GET LO LOST
MM THAT'S THE THING
I UM
TEMP IS NO WELL IT'S A I THINK THEY CAN THEY CAN THEY CAN DO
BECAUSE TH TH SOME SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THAT EXPERT THERE ARE COUPLE OF EXPERTS SO THEY LEARNED ITSELF
SO
IF THEY CAN EASILY RECOVER IT WELL
TO DO THIS KIND OF THING YOU KNOW
YEAH IT DEPENDS ON THE JOB
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE SMALL HARDWARE THING THEY MIGHT DO IT TO THEN YOU KNOW FIVE THOUSAND EUROS AND ALL
BUT IF IT'S VERY MUCH DETAILED WORK
THEY WILL JUST I IT THE SYSTEM THE THE WHOLE THING STARTS LIKE THIS THAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND SIGN A FORM AND THEN ONLY THEY WILL START TOUCHING YOUR HARD DISK
YEAH
NO NO BU NO TH THEY WILL
NO NO THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY LIKE YOU DO IT THEN SEND IT THE HARD DISK THEN THEY WILL SAY OKAY WE CAN DO IT
AND THEN IF YOU DO IT WITH ONLY WITH ONLY YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THEN WHAT DID THEY ESTIMATE OF THAT
YEAH
I THINK THAT IS YEAH
NO IT IT IS UP TO YOU KNOW
AND IN FACT IF THEY THEY CAN GO A LOT BUT YOU KNOW
THEY CAN GO BLOCK BY BLOCK AND LOOK INTO IT AND TRY TO RECOVER BUT UM THAT MATTHEW WILL WANT TO GO OR NOT IS THE QUESTION
YEAH
AND IT'S LIKE FORTY TERA
FOUR TERA THAT'S FORTY TERA
YEAH
FOUR THOUSAND G. B. S
YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG
MM UM
YEAH UH
MM YEAH IT'S A
AND HEMANT HOW UH HOW DO YOU WANT TO GO ABOUT IT
MM
NO I WILL SAY HOW DO YOU LIKE TO GO ABOUT WITH ICAS
MM
YOU DID IT ON ONLY ONE
AND THEY WERE THEN
YEAH
HE USE THE TRIPHONE M. L. P. AND GET UH
NO
NO I I GAVE YEAH
YEAH IT YEAH
NO NO
UH YEAH SCALE LIKE UH SCALE LIKELIHOO FROM UH T UH M. L. P.
YEAH WELL YEAH SO I J I D DO I DID TRY IT YEAH TH THAT'S HOW YOU DO THAT
NO BUT I THINK WHAT I THINK THERE IS STILL SOME DATA WHICH IS RECOVERABLE
AT LEAST THEY COULD GIVE US TIME TO I THINK THAT UH THE MOST OF THOSE THINGS SHOULD BE THERE
I CAN HOPE IT ALREADY IF THEY COULD
NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE BUT YOU COULD READ NO
YEAH
SO DANIEL IS WELL IN ITALY
YEAH
OH THAT IS FIRE WILL LOSE ALL THE DATA YOU KNOW
PHYSICALLY UH YEAH
YEAH PHYSICALLY IT IS UPDATED
NO I THINK THERE IS SPRINKLER OR SOMETHING AROUND HERE I HOPE SO
YEAH IN FACT THEY DISTRIBUTED THE WHOLE THING AROUND
THEY MAY NOT HAVE IT IN ONE PLACE
HMM
YEAH
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT I CAN RECOVER
NO BUT
FOR EXAMPLE F PHONEBOOK I CAN RECOVER EVERYTHING ON PHONEBOOK BECAUSE I HAVE IT ON THE C. D.
I WROTE IT ONCE TIME TO COPY IT TO MY HOME AND SO I HAVE ALL THE DATA OF MY C. D.
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I HAD I COPIED ALL THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ON THAT SO
DATA ITSELF
THE WHOLE FEATURE TO EVERYTHING
FEATURES SEGMENTATION EVERY LABEL FILE EVERYTHING IS THERE
I COULD RECOVER IT BACK FROM THERE ACTUALLY BUT
TEMP
NO
NO I UH
NOT
ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT THE NUMBERS I THINK I PRETTY MUCH CAN RECOVER ALL THE EVEN THE F TRIPHONE EXPERIMENTS
BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE KEPT THOSE LABELS ALL THOSE THINGS IN THE SPEECH DIRECTORY
A P. FILE OF IT
SO IT'S EASIER TO IT ALL BACK ALL THOSE LABELS AND EVERYTHING YEAH
P. L. P. SHOULD BE THERE
I RE SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE P. L. P. ALSO SOMEWHERE THA
N MM THE THE EXTRA WORK ON IS LIKE YOU KNOW CONVERTING THE SEGMENTATIONS FROM MONOPHONE TO TRIPHONE THIS KIND OF THING
THEN THE ALL THE SCRIPTS ARE THERE IN THE TEMP FILE THAT KIND OF THING
I UH LIKE NO NO NO NO NO
NO WHAT YOU DO IS LIKE YOU HAVE THE SEGMENTATION TO TRAIN THAT FOR MONOPHONES RIGHT
YOU CAN UH YOU CAN CONVERT THE SAME THING INTO TRIPHONE SEGMENTATION BECAUSE THERE IS MONOPHONE AND TRIPHONE THEY ARE NOT DIFFERENT
EXCEPT THAT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GIVE A DIFFERENT LABEL TO THEM P DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT
SO IT'S EASIER TO CONVERT THAT SEGMENTATION DIRECTLY HERE RATHER THAN NOW UGH YOU KNOW
YOU SAY THE POINT THAT IF YOU LOSE ONE UH SO UH SO THE THING IS THAT I HAVE TO RECOVER MEANS I HAVE TO RECOVER THROUGH THE PHO NO MONOPHONE SEGMENT SEGMENTATION TO TRIPHONE SEGMENTATION
THE WHOLE THING
YEAH IT'S OKAY
TH THAT UH NUMBERS IT'S VERY FAST SO IT'S NO PROBLEM
YEAH SO IT'S YEAH
YEAH
BUT RIGHT NOW YOU THE THING IS THAT RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW ALMOST WHAT IS THE UH LIKE THE WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THE BEST IS ALSO YOU CAN CONT INSTEAD OF RUNNING IT HMM
YEAH
ANYWAY MM LET'S RECOVER IT
HO LET'S HOPE THE BEST
I THINK I THINK WE HAVE SPENT
UH YEAH
OKAY
FINE
OKAY FINE
IT'S ALL WE HAVE TO LEAVE FAST
A LAPEL IS ALSO THERE
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S BETTER
UH YOU GO TO THE TABLE YOU HAVE THERE LIKE THE BIG TABLE YOU TOLD AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS
SO WHICH I THINK I HAVE ALL THE GAMMAS NO
ESPECIALLY GAMMA FULL MODELS I HAVE
YEAH POSTERIORS
AND POSTERIORS
EVEN YOU HAVE THOSE THREE STATE PERFORM GAMMAS ALSO YOU HAVE ALL THESE
HUH
AH OKAY
SO NOW YEAH NOW YOU CAN WRITE ANOTHER PAPER IF YOU CAN
GAMMAS TO POSTERIOR
I TWO HUNDRED
TWO HUNDRED MILLISECOND
SO BUT FOR NUMBERS I THINK IT MAY BE OKAY NUMBERS HARDLY YEAH
ONE TWO
EVEN LESS THAN THAT YEAH
JUST FEW WORDS LIKE SO BUT IF FOR OR SOMETHING
LIKE IF IT'S REALLY LONG SENTENCE OF TEN SECONDS OR SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT REALLY NEED SO MUCH CON
I KNOW IT'S REALLY COMPUTATIONALLY VERY INTENSIVE ALSO LIKE IF YOU USE
SO PRETTY MUCH ALL THE POSTERIORS ARE FROM YOU ONLY
SK
OH YOU KNOW
BUT AL FOR YOUR CASE YOU DON'T NEED REALLY COMPLICATED POSTERIOR YOU JUST NEED SOME P. L. P. S AND THEN
NO BUT BUT MA HE'S HE MAY BE LINKING TO MATTHEW I GUESS BECAUSE MATTHEW GOT THE WAV FILES
BUT YOU GOT THE ALL THE WAV FILES SO
YEAH SO THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE
UH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
SO IF HE GOT FEATURES THEN IT'S OKAY OTHERWISE IF HE HAS TO GENERATE AGAIN HE CAN'T GENERATE
YEAH
SO
BECAUSE
YEAH
BUT THE P EVERYBODY HAS FEATURES IN TEMP ONLY MOST OF THE TIME ALL THE C. T. S. FEATURES OR C. T. S. WAV FILES SO
SO FORGET ABOUT C. T. S. AT LEAST NOW I THINK BECAUSE IT'S AGAIN
IT TAKES AT LEAST ONE OR TWO WEEKS
BUT SEGMENTATION
BUT YOU SAY DO YOU NEED TO DO SOME SEGMENTATION ALSO ON TOP OF THAT SO
THEY'RE
YEAH THE WE CAN WAIT AT LEAST ONE OR TWO WEEKS FOR THIS BECAUSE IT'S
BUT STILL I THINK WE CAN'T REALLY DO THESE THINGS BEFORE ICAS BECAUSE YEAH
SO MAYBE WE CAN CONCENTRATE WORK ESPECIALLY ON NUMBERS NOW AND THEN WE CAN GO TO C. T. S.
SO IN NUMBERS CASE WHAT DO YOU REALLY NEED LIKE
YEAH BASICALLY YEAH W WE NEED TO GENERATE AGAIN P. L. P. S BUT WAVE FILES ARE THERE
YEAH P. L. P. S
BUT YOU'RE GENERATING P. L. P. S FROM
UM
MM
BUT AT LEAST YOU F
YEAH
YEAH THAT YOU CAN DEL
BUT AT LEAST YEAH YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO VERIFY THEIR WA
SO SO P. L. P. S OR THESE ARE ALL THIRTEEN JUST ONLY P. L. P. S NOT DELTAS AND DEL
YEAH
BUT IF YOU GOT SOMETHING FROM HEMANT OR MATTHEW THEN I HAVE THOSE NUMBER OF STAGE
LIKE WE HAVE THEN YOU KNOW LIKE IT'S ONLY FOR ONLY CLOSE UH D. C. L. K. C. L. THEY HAVE
NO HE HE GOT FROM YOU ONLY
AH
I THINK SO YEAH SO THEN I HAVE THOSE NUMBER OF STAGES
YEAH
AH OKAY
SO
AH
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY P. FOR THESE P. L. P. S NO P. L. P. S OR P. FILES FROM P. L. P.
SO BU WHAT ABOUT THIS NOISE LEVELS LIKE WE HAVE NOISE WAV FILES IN DA DA COM DATABASES
SO WE HAVE DIRECTLY F WAVE FILES WITH UH PARTICULAR NOISE
AH OK SEE
NO BUT BUT I THINK UH DE
BUT
HMM
BUT THE PROBLEM IS LIKE ALL THIS I THINK IT MAY NOT BE THERE IN DATABASE I GUESS
OH OKAY
YOU CALLED THE NOISE X. DATABASE
AH OKAY
EVEN WITH UH S. AND R. S
AH OKAY THEN IT'S OKAY
AH
SO Y YOU IT'S NOT THAT YOU ALL THE NO
YEAH WITH S. AND R. DIFFERENT S. AND R. S
YEAH SO AT LEAST WE HAVE WAVE FILES SO NOW WE CAN GENERATE ANYTHING IN THE P. L. P. S OR SO AT LEAST
YEAH
THOSE
BUT FOR ALL THESE S. AND R. S SO THAT'S ALSO AGAIN
HMM
NO THE THING IS LIKE YOU CAN'T REALLY WRITE THIS K I SUPPOSE UH THE CODE IS THE REAL PROBLEM SCRIPTS IS OKAY LIKE YEAH
EVEN SCRIPTS ALSO THE CONFIGURATIONS OR YOU DO IF YOU FORGET SOMETHING SOME FACTOR OR SOMETHING IT'S REALLY
WHICH DISK
UH THREE DISK
MM-HMM
SO IT SHOULD BE REPLACED BY
AH OK
MM-HMM
YEAH
HMM
IT WILL RI
UH IT WILL HAVE MEASURES LIKE
UH
HMM BUT LIKE THIS
BUT EVEN THIS MAYBE REALLY HUGE DATA ALSO
I THINK MAYBE SOME COMPANIES DEFINITELY DO INSURE YOU CAN'T REALLY HAVE SO MANY BACKUPS
WHICH JUST PARTITION THESE UH
HMM
BUT
YEAH
BUT UH WE WE
HMM
YEAH NO TEMP
UH SO THEN THEN
HMM
BUT IS IT REALLY COSTLY THE SYSTEM IS
HMM
MAYBE AT LEAST THEY WILL GIVE SOME NUMBER OTHERS LIKE THEY CAN
HMM
YEAH
YEAH AT LEAST THEY THEY WILL KNOW M BEFOREHAND I THINK UH
YEAH YEAH
MM BUT EVEN LIKE HOW MUCH IMPORTANT DATA L SOMETIMES IT'S JUST M. P. THREES OR SOMETHING SO YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO
FO FOUR TERA NO
FOUR TERA IT'S LIKE
MM-HMM
YEAH FOUR THOUSAND GIGABYTES
YEAH IT
BUT NOW WE GOT SOMETHING LIKE UH MORE THAN FIFT
NO RAID FIVE IS BETTER I THINK
IT L IT LEVELS
UH AH OKAY
MM-HMM
BUT RAID FIVE IS THEN THEN TWENTY PERCENT COPY ONLY
AH
IT'S NOT THE OTHER WAY
HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT WILL BE THEN THE OTHER DISK
YEAH
YEAH
AGAIN
SCALING
AND ALSO MAYBE LIKE THIS NOISE IS HE WAS
MM THIS IS NOT IN THE PAPER ACTUALLY D
THIS IS
HMM
YEAH
AT LEAST NOW HE CAN KNOW A FULL SYSTEM SETUP FROM
YEAH
SO NOW MAINLY LIKE UH THIRTY NINE P. L. P.
YOU WERE ALWAYS THIRTY NINE NO
NOT SURE BUT THEN WHY DID THIS FEATURES YOU GAVE ME LIKE THEY'RE THIRTEEN
YOU TRUNCATED THEM TO
NO NO NO NO THESE THESE THESE ONES LIKE THE
AH OKAY
HMM
AH
AH OKAY
DELTAS
AH OKAY
AH OK
HMM
YEAH THOSE RESULTS ONLY YOU REPORTED IN INTERSPEECH NO LIKE UH THIRTY NINE P. L. P. RESULTS
UH
UH THEY WERE BUT THEY WERE LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OR SO
NOW EVEN THE CLEAN SPEECH YOU ARE GETTING
NO NO THIS IS JUST
UH N NO HE GAVE SCALE TO ME THEN I GENERATED GAMMAS
EVEN UH
NO NO NO NO
THE THEY'RE DIFFERENTLY
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE I HAVE TRIPHONE G. M. G. M. M. S AND H. M. M. S
SO HE GAVE ME SCALE LIKELIHOODS OF TRIPHONES
SCALE LIKELIHOOD
SCALE LIKELIHOODS
FROM TRIPHONE MEMORY
HMM
SO THEN AGAIN I WILL PASS THROUGH FULL NETWORK
THEN I CAN GENERATE TRIPHONE GAMMAS
IT'S LIKE
IT'S NO NO IT'S UH IT'S JUST G. M. M. WORD MODELS
YOU HAVE ALL THE CONNECTIONS TO BETWEEN ALL THE WORDS LIKE HMM
SO THEN FIRST THING IS LIKE WE NEED TO GENERATE P. L. P. S AND THEN
ALL THESE S. AND R. S P. L. P. S
HMM
NO IT WAS THERE ON UH LIKE UH YESTERDAY MORNING ALSO LIKE EVEN
SO I WAS RUNNING SOME EXPERIMENTS AND THEN IT WAS OKAY BUT IT'S READABLE ONLY SO I CAN'T WRITE ANYTHING SO
YEAH SO BUT WE DON'T KNOW LIKE WE THOUGHT LIKE I THOUGHT IT'S RECOVERING SO MAYBE BY TOMORROW I'LL GET EVERYTHING SO
UH SO IF YOU WANT A COPY AGAIN YOU'LL HAVE
BUT YEAH STILL SOME PEOPLE ARE IN VACATION SO THEY WILL REALLY
PEDRO PEDRO ALSO
HMM
BUT EVEN ALL OVER THE RECENT ITERATION ITERATE TRAINING SET IN TEMP
BECAUSE LIKE WE WE S HOW MUCH WE CAN COPY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY SO MANY ITERATIONS AND EVEN WE THOUGHT OF REALLY COMPLETING MINIMAL EXPERIMENT ALSO MM
BUT AT LEAST YEAH A SCRIPT ARE THERE EVERY SCRIPTS LIKE AT LEAST SCRIPTS ARE THERE BUT SO IF IF THEY CAN DECODE
YEAH IF THEY CAN DECODE AT LEAST HEMANT'S P. FILES THEN HEMANT CAN
YEAH
BUT C. FILES YEAH
EVEN IF THEY GIVE YOU P. FILES IT'S REALLY BETTER EVEN YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO RU RUN ALL THE
YEAH YEAH YOU J JUST ONLY LIKE RECENT P. FILES AT LEAST
NO NO NO
YEAH
BUT STILL I THINK I IT DEPENDS
UH IN EDINBURGH THEY HAD THAT BIG FIRE AND THEN
EVEN EVEN SA SEVERAL UH DA BUILDINGS AND ALL THE COMPUTERS IN THAT BUILDING THEY ALL BURNED
BUT THEY HAVE LIKE THREE BACKUPS IN THE UNIVERSITY SO ALL THESE PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT MUCH
NO IT'S THE UNIVERSITY IS MAYBE IT'S REALLY BIG SO THEY CAN AFFORD FOR
YEAH THEY YEAH YEAH THEY WANT TH THEY'LL HAVE BACKUP IN DIFFERENT AND ALSO IN IN SOME IN UNDERGROUND
SO THAT LIKE FILE PROOF OR SOMETHING YEAH
YEAH MAYBE
NO C. D. S ARE NOT ENOUGH LIKE NO
YEAH HOW MUCH UH
HMM
HMM
BUT WHAT ABOUT HOME DIRECTORIES OR HE ALSO KEPT EVERYTHING IN UH TEMP
YEAH
BUT HE HE DID MOSTLY ON NUMBERS NO
SO AT LEAST IF WE CAN RECOVER WE WE CAN READ SOME OF HIS STUFF OR SOMETHING
DID YOU LOCATE IT
IT IS HOME OR HOME SPEECH OR SOMETHING
LOOK FOR ANY FEATURES OR ANYTHING ARE THERE
NO NO HE HE MAYBE HE MIGHT BE USING SAME P. L. P. FEATURES OR SOMETHING IT THEY ARE DIFFERENT
WE DON'T KNOW IT
UH HIS OWN
AH OKAY IS HERE HE GOT UH HIS OWN
YEAH
UH
HEY
HMM
OH THEN IT'S GOOD YOU KNOW LIKE WE DON'T REALLY NEE
SO BUT YOUR P. L. P. IS ALSO LIKE
MM-HMM
THEN WE JUST NEED TO RUN YOUR NEURAL NET ONLY YEAH BUT P. P. P. L. P. S ARE LIKE HARDLY FEW MINUTES LI
MM
WHICH WHICH SCRIPTS
AND THEN
BUT BUT YOU STILL NEED TO RUN ALL THE NETS NO L
IT'S
NO BUT IT'S IT'S NOT I THINK AT LEAST IT TAKES TWO HOURS OR THREE HOURS I THINK
YOU CAN'T PARALLEL ALSO THAT'S THE PROBLEM
HE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF HE WANT REPEATED ALL THESE RESULTS THEN HE JU HE NEED TO USE ALL MA HEMANT'S P. L. P. CONFIGURATION THEN THAT'S REALLY
YEAH THE RESULTS WILL BE
THEN YOU DON'T YOU DON'T KNOW UH UH WELL
YEAH FOR THIRTY FIVE FORTY MINUTES IT IS
UH UH THANK YOU
IT'S ALL
OOPS
MM-HMM
THE RAPPLE ALSO
NO
OKAY
MM-HMM
WITH THE LINK HERE IN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OF THE VALUE YEAH MM-HMM
MM OF THE PREVIOUS R UH PAGE RANK OR OF THE
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
MM
OKAY
MM UH-HUH
SO WAIT UH I DON'T GET IT
YOU YOU HAVE TWO REPRESENTATION ONE WHICH COMES FROM THIS LINK UH STUFF AND ONE F THIS ONE IS NOT BASED ON P. L. S. A. TOO
YEAH
OKAY
Y
A T. YEAH UH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH OKAY OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
AH UH OKAY
YEAH YEAH IT'S OKAY
MM MM MM
YEAH
OR THEY USE THE PERPLEXITY ON THE THE LIKELIHOOD TO SAY OH GOOD THIS LIKELIHOOD IS UH IS IT'S SMALLER THAN THE OTHER
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH IT'S THE SAME
I IT'S MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT UH THIS HUMAN CATEGORISATION IS RELATED TO THE ONE THAT IS DISCOVERED UH MM
MM
OH YEAH
NO BUT
BUT I HAVE THE FEELING I IN
BUT IN THIS CASE YOU YOU HAVE TO USE UH THE LABEL ONE YEAH
YOUR LOS
BUT HOW DOES IT ENTER IN THAT
I I YOU HAVE TO TRAIN YOUR UH
YOUR TRAINING DATA
YEAH BUT THE POINT IS THAT YOU SHOULD CHANGE IN A WAY THAT TO TAKE THE LABEL INTO ACCOUNT OR NOT
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
MM-HMM
MM MM
NO BUT W
BUT I
NO
THE THE THERE IS NOT UH V UH PERFECT UH CLUSTERING CLUS WH WHAT IS THE HOW DO YOU JUDGE UH WHAT IS A GOOD CLUSTERING
AND YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY COMPAR UH
YOU'RE COMPARING THEM
AH OKAY OKAY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
ALSO LIKE A BASELINE YEAH
YOU M YOU STILL NOT COMBI
NO NO BUT IT'S ANOTHER
MM
MM-HMM
MM
MM MM
IN FACT I I HAVE SEEN A PAPER IN I. C. M. L. WHERE THE GUY WAS TRYING TO LEARN WHICH WORD HE UM ASPECTS OF CLUSTERING
SO I GIVE YOU I GIVE THE REAL USERS MM THE PERSON UM A BUNCH OF MARBLES AND THEY BEGIN TO SAY OKAY
AND THEY HAVE TO DIVIDE IT IN FIVE GROUP AND IN THE END IT'S NOT AL IT'S IT'S ALWAYS DIFFERENT TO THE CLUSTERING EACH PEOPLE HAS
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE
BUT IN BUT THERE IS UH SOME CHARACTERISTIC THAT ARE FOR TRANSPARENCY COLOUR
WHICH ARE UM FEATURES THAT MADE THE CLUSTERING THAT CAN BE EXTRACTED EVEN IF THE CLUSTERING IT'S ALWAYS DIFFERENT
SO SO THAT'S ONLY TO SAY THAT UH IT'S IT CAN BE REALLY INFINITIVE CLUSTERING
MM-HMM
SAY ANOTHER ANOTHER EXAMPLE APART FROM UH THIS UH SEARCH
UH I DON'T GET IT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU MEAN THEN DON'T DON'T USE A GOOGLE PAGE BECAUSE IT'S UH TOO UH S ROOT BUT UH ANOTHER PAGE MM
MM
MM-HMM
OH IT'S NOT THAT
PEOPLE BEING YOUR ALGORITHM
THAT'S THE POINT
MM
IT'S GETTING
MM-HMM EXACTLY
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TO FIT YEAH
MM
YOU HAD ONL TWO TOPICS
OR NO
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT WAS LINKI MM-HMM MM-HMM
SO IT WAS A A GOOD POINT FOR YOU
MM MM-HMM MM
LIKE THIS YEAH MM MM MM OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
MM MM
MM MM PROBABLY NOT YEAH
MM MM
MM MM
MM
YEAH MM
AND
MM-HMM
YEAH
UM THIS ALPHA I CAN IT BE DEPENDENT OF THE OF THE DOCUMENT
AND HOW MANY TEXT IS IN IT
OR SOMETHING UH YEAH
MM
MM-HMM SO MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH OF COURSE
YEAH MM
MM
YEAH YEAH W W I THINK WE'VE AGREE ON THAT YEAH
MM MM
MM
MM PROBABLY HEURISTIC IT WILL BE EASIER TO COMPUTE BECAUSE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM YEAH MM
MM
MM
DID YOU MANAGE TO TO DIVIDE THE LINK UH PROPERLY OR
OKAY
MM-HMM
L. D. A.
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM PYRAMID YEAH
AH OKAY
YEAH
MM MM
'KAY
MM MM
IN TWO MONTHS YEAH
YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER YOU'VE GOT THESE THINGS ON RIGHT OR NOT
YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE ON RIGHT OR NOT
FEELS WRONG
OKAY SO I DON'T NEED THAT
OKAY
SO DAVID CAME IN TO ME AND TO SAY UH I SOMETHING WE'D BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE WAS SOME STUFF I'D BEEN WORKING ON ABOUT USING THESE TOPIC MODELS WITH UH WITH NETWORKS
WITH N THINGS WITH LINKS BETWEEN THEM DOCUMENTS THAT ARE LINKED
UH N UH IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S RELATED TO RAPPLE
BUT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT TH THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW
UH JUST BECAUSE I CAME UP WITH SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON
BUT UH TH AT THE TIME BASICALLY I'D BEEN TRYING TO USE P. L. S. A. AND THOSE TYPES OF MODELS ON WEB PAGES
AND THAT CAME UP WITH UH A BIG PROBLEM IN THAT MOST WEB PAGES HAVE VERY VERY LITTLE TEXT ON THEM
BUT YOU CAN TELL WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT BASED ON THE OTHER TEXTS ON THE SITE
THE TEXTS ON THE THINGS THEY'RE LINKED TO SO WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW WAS CAN YOU COMBINE THE TOPIC MODELS THAT THE PAGES
THAT HAVE LOTS OF TEXT ON THEM
WITH SOMETHING ELSE THAT THAT TELLS YOU WHAT A PAGE THAT HAS NO OR VERY LITTLE TEXT ON IT BASED ON THE LINKS YEAH
SO QUITE SIMPLY IF YOU HAVE A PAGE ONE WHICH IS LIKE A HOME PAGE
AND THAT'LL MAYBE HAVE FIVE LINKS AND A PICTURE ON IT AND THEN BECAUSE IT LINKS TO PAGE TWO AND PAGE THREE
CAN YOU TELL WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
YEAH SO I STARTED LOOKING AT UH GOOGLE PAGE RANK WHICH KINDA DOES THIS BY SAYING WELL
THE LINKS GO THE OTHER WAY IT SAYS IF THIS PAGE IS ABOUT FISH OR IN GOOGLE
THEY SAY IF THIS PAGE IS GOOD IN SOME WAY AND IT LINKS TO THIS OTHER PAGE
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS THEN THAT PAGE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE GOOD
AND IT'S JUST PAGE RANK IS JUST A SIMPLE ALGORITHM FOR DOING THIS OVER THE WHOLE BIG NETWORK
SO I WANTED TO COMBINE THE TOPIC MODELS THAT TELL YOU BEFOREHAND WHAT YOU THINK THIS PAGE AND THIS PAGE ARE ABOUT WITH THIS TO MAYBE GET A BETTER IDEA
SO THE IDEA IS SAY YOU'VE GOT SOME TEXT ON A PAGE
THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE PICTURE ABOUT WHAT OF WHAT THE PAGE IS REALLY ABOUT AND THE LINKS POINTING TO THAT PAGE ARE ALSO PART OF THE PICTURE
SO I BASICALLY CAME UP WITH AN ALGORITHM THAT'S JUST A I IT PLUGS P. L. S. A. UH PLUGS PAGE RANK INTO P. L. S. A.
RIGHT SO PAGE RANK YOU BASICALLY JUST D UH SAY
YOU BASICALLY TAKE THE HOW GOOD THIS PAGE IS WHICH IS X. AND HOW GOOD THIS PAGE IS WHICH IS Y.
AND YOU THEN SAY THIS PAGE IS BASED ON UH HOW DO YOU DO THIS
BASED ON THE THE LINKS COMING INTO IT UH IT'S JUST A LIKE A SUM OVER ALL THE THE LINKS OF UH WELL X. LINK I GUESS
O OF OF THE VALUE
UH UH THE BUT IT'S NOT IT'S
YEAH
IF IF SO IF THIS IS PAGE RANK OF X. PAGE RANK OF Y.
I THINK THIS IS ROUGHLY IT OFF HAND
PAGE RANK OF Z.
SO YOU SAY PAGE RANK OF Z. IS EQUAL TO UH ONE OVER A CONSTANT TO NORMALISE IT
UH SUM OVER ALL THE LINKS INTO Z. OF PAGE RANK
OF THE LINK
YEAH THA IT'S LIKE THAT YEAH
SO SIMILAR IDEA
IF YOU GOT A VECTOR THAT SAYS WHAT THE TOPICS ARE SAY YOU'VE LEARNED FROM P. L. S. A. A D A DISTRIBUTION OF TOPICS FOR EVERY PAGE
SO IF YOU SAY A PROBABILITY OF TOPIC ONE FOR UH FOR PAGE UH Z.
UH IS EQUAL TO AND YOU CAN USE THE SAME SORT OF THING
RIGHT SO NICKING A WHOLE BUNCH OF MATHS FROM HOW YOU WORK OUT PAGE RANK UH IT COMES UP WITH UH JUST UH AN ITERATIVE ALGORITHM
WHICH IS JUST UH THE CURRENT PROBABILITY OF TOPIC ONE GIVEN Z. SO THAT'S PROBABILITY OLD PLUS UH
I YEAH PLUS THAT AND THEN YOU NORMALISE BETWEEN THEM SO YOU SAY ALPHA AND ONE MINUS ALPHA
YEAH
SO W BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE ONE MINUS ALPHA SAY LINK CONTRIBUTION YOU CAN CALL THIS I GUESS
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT A PAGE IS PARTLY FROM ITS TEXT THAT YOU'VE GOT ON THE PAGE AND IT'S PARTLY FROM WHAT THE LINKS SAY IT'S ABOUT
SO THAT ALPHA THING IS HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST THE TEXT ON THE PAGE AND HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST THE LINKS
SO THAT ALPHA COULD BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERY PAGE
SO WHAT I DID THEN WAS TRY THIS ON A BIG DATABASE OF WEB PAGES
UH AND I HAD SOME RESULTS FROM THAT BUT THEY WERE ALL ON TEMP TWO SO THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW
UH BUT AS IT IS NOT REALLY IMPORTANT I CAN REGENERATE THAT
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THIS GIVES YOU A NEW VECTOR OF TOPICS FOR EVERY PAGE
SO YOU'VE GOT TWO VECTORS YOU'VE GOT THE ONE THAT YOU'VE JUST GOT FROM P. L. S. A. OR WHATEVER MODEL AND YOU'VE GOT THE ONE THAT YOU GET FROM THIS
UH HOW DO YOU TELL WHICH ONE'S BETTER
I HAD NO WAY TO EVALUATE THIS WELL
HOW DO YOU TELL THAT THIS PAGE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE TOPICS ARE 'CAUSE THEY'RE LEARNED AUTOMATICALLY UH SO
IT IT IS YEAH BECAUSE UH B YEAH YOU INITIALISE IT WITH UH ACTUALLY THI THIS IS KINDA WRONG
THIS IS NOT OLD BUT START THIS IS HOW YOU THIS IS HOW YOU YOU START IT OFF
SO THIS THIS IS WHAT P. L. S. A. GIVES YOU TO START WITH AND THEN YOU ITERATE THIS AND IT BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE
YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'S IT EXACTLY YEAH
EXACTLY YEAH SO YOU'VE NOW GOT YOU'VE GOT P. L. S. A. GIVES YOU TWO PROBABILITIES RIGHT
SO IT GIVES YOU A PROBABILITY OF A TOPIC GIVEN A DOCUMENT WHICH IS Z. GIVEN D. AND A PROBABILITY OF A WORD GIVEN A TOPIC
SO THIS IS THE SAME FOR BOTH MODELS
YEAH
WELL YEAH WHAT YOU DO IS YOU'RE TAKING THIS AND ITERATING OVER IT THE PROBABILITY OF THE TOPIC GIVEN THE DOCUMENT
UH SO HAVE I MADE THAT CLEAR I'M I'M NOT SURE IF I'M EXPLAINING THIS WELL
OKAY
RIGHT SO Y I YOU M
YEAH SO WE WERE STRUGGLING AT HOW DO YOU EVALUATE THIS
BECAUSE UH I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THAT P. L. S. A. AND ALL THOSE KIND OF MODELS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED
IT'S TH THEY NEVER QUANTITATIVE QUANTITATIVELY DO ANYTHING
THEY ALWAYS SAY UH WELL LOOK AT THE CLUSTERING THERE'S HERE WE'VE GOT SOME DOCUMENTS THAT ALL APPEAR TO BE ABOUT THE SAME THING
AND HERE'S WHERE WE GET SOME OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT ALL APPEAR TO BE ABOUT THE SAME THING
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL EXACTLY HOW GOOD THAT IS YOU CAN JUST GET AN IDEA THAT IT'S
YEAH SO THA THAT'S THE FIRST THING TH THAT THING WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT THIS
YOU SUGGESTED D USE THE LIKELIHOOD AND PEDRO CAME UP WITH A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE WHY THAT COULD BE BAD
SO YOU HAVE UH
YOU HAVE THE UH OH LET ME THING OF WHAT THIS WAS
IT WAS TO DO WITH CARS BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A TOPIC THAT'S UH REPRESENTING
CARS AND YOU CAN TELL THAT THAT'S REPRESENTING CARS BY LOOKING AT THIS DISTRIBUTION AND IT'S THE SAME FOR BOTH
NOW YOU WANNA TELL WHICH I I THIS PAGE UH PEDRO'S EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT WAS IS THAT IS SAYS ON THE PAGE LOTUS ELISE
OKAY
AND THAT UH NO F I CAN'T I JUST REMEMBER IT WAS A REALLY CAN YOU IG REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
NO OKAY
YEAH I DIDN'T REALLY CONSIDER DOING IT ON PERPLEXITY ACTUALLY THAT TO BE HON BUT OKAY
OKAY
IS THAT FAIR THOUGH BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THESE TOPIC MODELS IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU CAN'T MAKE THEM CLUSTER
OKAY
HMM
YEAH
OKAY
AND THAT IS IS THAT REALLY FAIR THOUGH
CAN YOU SAY THAT IF A SET OF DOCUMENTS IF THE CLUSTERING OF THESE DOCUMENTS IS CLOSER TO THE EFFECTI WHAT YOU WHAT YOU'VE GOT THERE IS UH A CLUSTERING OF DOCUMENTS A AS YOUR DEVALUATION
YEAH
UH THI THIS THESE LABELS THE YAHOO CATEGORIES THAT'S THAT'S A CLUSTERING
SO YOU'RE BY SAYING THAT THIS CLUSTERING IS CLOSER TO THAT CLUSTERING IS IS DOES THAT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT'S BETTER
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM KAY
MM
WE UH I THINK YOUR POINT WAS THAT YOU YOU TRAIN THIS WITHOUT LABELLING FIRST YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
WELL TH YEAH
THE THE THING THAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT SAY THE REALLY REALLY REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THIS WHERE YOUR DIRECTORY HAD TWO CATEGORIES IN IT
UH GOOD AND BAD
AND AND AND YOU RUN P. L. S. A. ON IT NOW THAT DOESN'T DO IT GOOD AND BAD IT DOES I DUNNO ENGLISH AND FRENCH PAGES
SO THEY DON'T MATCH BUT THE CLUSTERING IS STILL VERY GOOD IN IN ONE RESPECT
UH BUT BUT YOU YOU CAN EXTEND THAT UP EVEN IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED CATEGORIES
P. L. S. A. CAN FIND A HUNDRED CLUSTERS THAT ARE A GOOD CLUSTERING BUT ARE COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO THE DIRECTORY
HMM
BUT BUT WHAT I WANNA KNOW I IS THAT WHICH OF THEM HAS THE BETTER REPRESENTATION OF A GIVEN PAGE
SO SO GIVEN A RANDOM PAGE UH AND THESE TWO MODELS UH AND THE WO THE WORDS THAT THESE TWO MODELS GIVE WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
S OKAY
I'M I'M JUST N CONCERNED THAT THAT'S UH THAT THAT'S IT'S ANSWERING A QUESTION THAT EVALUATES IN SOME WAY BUT MAYBE NOT IN THE WAY THAT
WELL THAT MAYBE NOT IS THE SAME WAY I WAS THINKING
BUT MAYBE IT'S A BETTER WAY UM SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT SORRY I'M TRYING TO PROCESS ALL THIS
UH
YEAH I IT'S THE SAME THING LIKE IT IT DOES TELL YOU WHETHER THIS UH WHICH CLUSTERING IS BETTER FOR THIS TASK
BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHICH CLUSTERING BETTER REPRESENTS THE PAGES NECESSARILY
BUT IT IT'S IT YOU YOU COULD SAY THAT IT POSSIBLY DOE IT PROBABLY DOES
OKAY
MM
YEAH I
MM
OKAY
MM
I THINK MM
UH NO I TH I'M I'M COMING ROUND TO IT ACTUALLY
NO I'M SO I I I THINK I G UH I I GET IT
UH I I TH I THINK IT PROBABLY IS FAIR I'M JUST I I'VE GOTTEN UM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT
BUT I THINK THAT'LL GO IF I THINK ABOUT IT ENOUGH
UH BUT BUT YEAH THE IT IT BUT IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE SUSPECT
BUT I THINK THAT'S JUST FROM THE WHOLE POINT THAT YOU CAN'T TELL WHICH CLUSTERING IS B BETTER
BUT UH WHAT I'D THOUGHT BEFORE WAS COULD YOU GET PEOPLE TO EVALUATE THIS BY BY HAND BASICALLY
COULD YOU GIVE PEOPLE A SET OF PAGES AND LIKE SAY YOU DID IT WITH FIVE TOPICS FOR EXAMPLE
UH NOW YOU GIVE PEOPLE FIVE SHEETS UH YOU GIVE UH A T A A USER FIVE SHEETS OF PAPER EACH WITH
WORDS IN VARYING SIZES REPRESENTING THE PROBABILITY OF THAT TOPIC FOR EXAMPLE
TRY GIVE THE USER THESE PIECES OF PAPER TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THESE TOPICS ARE THAT'S THIS P. OF W. GIVEN Z.
AND THEN YOU GIVE THEM SOME PAGES AND SAY WHICH ONE WOULD YOU WHICH PIECE OF PAPER WOULD YOU PUT THAT WITH
AND THEN YOU GET LIKE AN INTUITIVE IDE UH LIKE HOW WOULD A PERSON CLUSTER PAGES GIVEN THE WHAT THESE TOPICS SUPPOSEDLY ARE
'CAUSE I YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT'S FIXED THE THE P. OF W. GIVEN Z. WITH RESPECT TO BOTH MODELS
SO I WAS TR I WAS HOPING YOU COULD USE THAT TO
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY
HMM
OKAY
SEE
THE THE THING ABOUT WEB PAGES I THOUGHT AS WELL IN THAT GETTING HUMANS TO EVALUATE IT IN SOME WAY IS THAT YOU HAVE MOST OF THE WEB PAGES THAT ARE UH WELL A LOT OF THE WEB PAGES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN SOME WAY ARE ARE ARE HOME PAGES
SO GOOGLE DOT COM DOESN'T ACTUALLY SAY THE WORDS SEARCH ON IT I THINK
I MAYBE IT SAYS GO BUT YOU ONLY KNOW IT'S ABOUT SEARCH THROUGH THE THING BUT SOMEONE LOOKING AT IT CAN TELL THAT IT'S A SEARCH ENGINE
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT'S LAID OUT BECAUSE OF THE PICTURES ON IT AND BECAUSE OF ALL OF THAT
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S COMPLETELY LOST IN THIS BAG OF WORDS REPRESENTATION AND I WAS HOPING THAT IN SOME WAY YOU COULD USE THAT TO EVALUATE THIS
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW BUT UH YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
OKAY I THINK I KNOW IT
BUT IT YEAH THI THIS IS EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE HAVE HERE THOUGH AND TH THAT DIRECTORY IS ONE CLUSTERING OF THE MARBLES
AND YOU'RE HOPING THAT IT IT SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT I HAVE TWO CLUSTERINGS OF MARBLES FOR MY TWO MODELS
AND I HAVE A TEST CLUSTERING OF MARBLES
IT'S SAYING THAT ONE OF THESE IS MORE CLOSE TO THE TEST T T TO THE THE ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN
IS THAT IT'S SAYING THAT WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY SAY
THAT DOESN'T UH IT SAYS IT'S G BETTER FOR THIS TASK BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY SAY ANYTHING ELSE
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
UH AND SO AND SO IF I GET THAT RIGHT
WHAT WHAT THE ALGORITHMS ARE STILL COMING UP WITH IS IN THIS WAY YOU'RE LOOKING AT A CLUSTERING OF MARBLES YEAH
IF EACH OF THE ALGORITHMS COMES UP WITH A DEFIN
AH OKAY RIGHT THAT MAKES SENSE
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
I'M CONVINCED I'M CONVINCED ALRIGHT
SO IT'S GOOD
RIGHT
UH ALRIGHT WELL THANKS
UM I'M TRYING TO THINK OF ANYTHING I HAVEN'T SAID ABOUT THE STUFF BUT THAT UH FROM LOOKING AT THE RESULTS I GOT IT LOOKED QUITE GOOD
UM JUST LIKE HAND READING THEM IN THAT ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WAS I STARTED A I A WEB CRAWL AT THE IDIAP HOMEPAGE
IT DID NOT VERY MANY PAGES ONLY LIKE TWO THOUSAND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT ENOUGH TO GET THE PAGES THAT WERE CLOSE TO IDIAP TO HAVE A LOT OF LINKS BETWEEN THEM
SO THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO RUN THIS LINK CLUSTERING ALGORITHM
SO WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE PAGES AROUND IDIAP THERE'S A LOT OF ENGLISH PA SPEAKING PAGES AND A LOT OF FRENCH SPEAKING PAGES
SO OF COURSE THIS UH P. L. S. A. COMPLETELY SEPARATED THOSE OUT INTO INTO CATEGORIES
UH SO WHEN I LOOKED AT THE THE WORD LIKELIHOODS THERE WERE TWO TOPICS
ONE WAS VERY CLEARLY ENGLISH WORDS THAT MOST LIKELY WORD WAS THE AND ONE WAS VERY CLEARLY FRENCH WORDS MOST LIKELY WORDS WAS DE I THINK AND UH
NO I HAD MANY TOPICS
THE OTHERS LOOKED LIKE GARBAGE COULDN'T TELL WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
BUT ANYWAY UH THA THAT'S OFTEN THE CASE
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT YOU CAN TELL VERY CLEARLY THAT ONE OR TWO TOPICS ARE A B NOT THE REST YEAH
IT IS
OK
HMM
THAT W UH ANYWAY THAT WHEN I RUN IT ON THAT UH WHAT I FOUND WAS
LOOKING THROUGH SOME OF THE SITES UH I LOOKED FOR THE SITES THAT THE MODELS DIFFERED ON
THAT WHERE ONE SAID IT WAS PROBABLY AN ENGLISH PHRASE AND THE OTHER SAID IT WAS PROBABLY A FRENCH PHRASE
AND I FOUND A GOOD FEW EXAMPLES WHERE YOU HAD A SITE THAT LOOKED UH WELL ONE THAT I REMEMBER OFF HAND WAS IT WAS A PAGE AND IT WAS A BIG PICTURE
AND LINKS DOWN THE SITE BUT THE LINKS WERE ALL PICTURES
SO YOU COULDN'T THE THE WORDS WERE IN FRENCH AND THE LINKS BUT THERE WERE NO WORDS PICKED UP BY THE WHEN I DID THE CRAWL FOR THE MODEL
AND THERE WAS A SMALL BIT DOWN HERE AND IN THIS THERE WAS UH MEANT TO BE PICTURE IN THERE
BUT IT DIDN'T LOAD UH OR UH B IT WAS MEANT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE
AND IT SAID UH IN ENGLISH IT SAID FOUR O. FOUR THIS PAGE CANNOT BE FOUND
SO ALL THE WORDS ON THIS PAGE WERE ENGLISH BUT IT WAS VERY VERY CLEARLY A FRENCH PAGE
SO THE FIRST MODEL SAID IT WAS AN ENGLISH PAGE 'CAUSE ALL THE WORDS WERE IN ENGLISH
SECOND MODEL SAID VERY DEFINITELY A FRENCH PAGE BECAUSE ALL OF THESE POINTED TO FRENCH SITES AND IT WAS ONLY POINTED TO IT WAS SOMETHING DOT F. R. AS WELL
IT'S
YEAH
SO I I FOUND A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THAT WERE KINDA LIKE THAT
MM BUT THE THE PROBLEM THAT I FOUND WHEN I RAN IT
UH THE TH THE THING THAT WAS A BAD POINT WAS THAT IF YOU HAVE UH SAY TRYIN I WAS TRYING TO SAY IF YOU COULD EVALUATE THIS WITH SEARCH GIVEN SOME KEYWORDS LIKE WHICH MODEL WOULD MORE LIKELY FIND YOU A P GOOD DOCUMENT
THAT THAT SORT OF APPROACH
UH WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT SAY YOU HAD UH
UH TH THA THAT'S NOT TOO RELEVANT NECESSARILY BUT IF YOU HAVE SAY A TOPIC DISTRIBUTION FOR UH ONE PAGE
AND IT VERY VERY HIGHLY SCORES ON THE P. L. S. A. FOR ONE OF THE THE TOPICS
AND THAT'S RIGHT OKAY THIS MODEL BECAUSE IT'S AVERAGING OUT OVER ALL THE PAGES NEARBY ALL OF THE TOPIC DISTRIBUTIONS BECOME MORE FLAT
IT IT BECOMES MORE UNCERTAIN ABOUT EVERYTHING
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S NECESSARILY A GOOD THING OR NOT YEAH
IN IN SOME CASES IT'S GONNA BE A BAD THING B BECAUSE EV EVERY PAGE IS LINKED BY THE WAY THE ALGORITHM WORKS
EVERY PAGE IS LINKED EVENTUALLY TO EVERYTHING ELSE SO IT EVERY PAGE HAS INFORMATION INCORPORATED IN IT
OR I THE DISTRIBUTION LEARNED FOR EVERY PAGE HAS INFORMATION INCORPORATED IN IT FROM EVERY OTHER PAGE'S DISTRIBUTION AS WELL
SO IT AVERAGES OUT IT FLATTENS ALL THE DISTRIBUTIONS DEPENDING ON WHAT THIS ALPHA IS
MM-HMM
WELL I I THINK THAT THE THING IS
YEAH THAT THAT THERE'S A BALANCE IN THE UH FOR EXAMPLE TAKE A PAGE LIKE UH SLASHDOT
AND IT'S LIKE A NEWS SITE UH FOR GEEKS AND YOU HAVE UH NERDS YEAH
NEWS FOR NERDS STUFF THAT MATTERS
UH ALL OF THE LIKE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES POINT TO THAT BUT THEY'RE ABOUT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS
SO YOU IN EFFECT ARE LOSING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THAT PAGE IS ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS POINTING TO IT AND THEY ALL AVERAGE OUT AS
YEAH SO THAT
TH THAT'S MY FIRST IDEA W WAS HOW I SET THIS I REMEMBER FOR THE LOTUS THING WASN'T THERE
UM SO I THOUGHT YOU WANNA PROBABLY SET THIS ALPHA PER PAGE THERE'S PROBABLY SOME HEURISTICS
FOR EXAMPLE THIS PAGE THERE'S NO TEXT IN IT WILL SET IT VERY LOW IN USER INFORMATION FOR THE LINKS
PROBLEM IS THIS IS WHAT PEDRO IMMEDIATELY SAID WHAT IF YOU HAVE A PAGE THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS
IT'S GOT A BIG PICTURE OF A CAR UH
ANYWAY AND IT SAYS LOTUS ELISE SO YOU KNOW THAT IT'S DEFINITELY ABOUT CAR BUT IT'S ONLY GOT TWO WORDS
SO YOU CAN'T JUST DO IT BY WORDS BECAUSE THOSE TWO WORDS COMPLETELY SPECIFY INTO SOMETHING OR OTHER
UH SU YOU SUGGESTED DOING LIKELIHOOD BUT AT THAT TIME AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT MY PROBLEM WAS WITH THAT
IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING BUT YOU'VE GOT TWO LIKELIHOODS FOR IT AS WELL
NO MAYBE NOT
MM
YEAH MAYBE DO IT BY CROSS VALIDATION SOMETHING
OKAY THERE'S
MM
HMM
YEAH THAT THAT IS FAIR
YEAH OKAY
IT YEAH D
NO
YEAH I SO UH I I THINK THAT THAT'S TOO EASY
YOU CAN DO IT WITH SOME HEURISTICS AND YOU CAN LEARN IT FROM THE TASK RESULTS IN OR COMBINE THE TWO SO THA THAT'S KINDA STRAIGHTFORWARD I THINK
YEAH
THE THE THE THING ABOUT DOING IT THROUGH CROSS VALIDATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH THE TASK IS UH THE PROBLEM WITH DOING A PAGE RANK STYLE ALGORITHM IS THAT IS THAT IT GETS BETTER IT IT CONVERGES BETTER AND IT GIVES YOU BETTER RESULTS
THE CLOSER A NETWORK IS TO BEING A SMALL WORLD NETWORK
SO SMALL WORLD NETWORK MEAN BASICALLY SOME FAR LINKS BUT GENERALLY VERY CLUSTERED LOCALLY
UH NOW THE THING ABOUT DOING A WEB CRAWL IS THE BIGGER YOUR WEB CRAWL
THE CLOSER IT'LL BE TO THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE NET N THE INTERNET WHICH IS A SMALL WORLD NETWORK
THE SMALLER YOUR WEB CRAWL THE LESS SMALL WORLD NETWORK LIKE IT'S GONNA BE
SO THE MORE PAGES YOU GET THE BETTER YOUR RESULTS
AND PEOPLE RUNNING THIS STYLE OF ALGORITHM THE PAGE RANK STYLE STUFF GENERALLY RUN IT ON ABOUT TWO MILLION OR TWENTY MILLION PAGES OR WHATEVER
THE THE STANFORD WEB BASE DATA SET THAT I WAS USING FOR THIS FOR FOR A BIT OF THIS UM
THEY HAVE A A D I CAN'T REMEMBER OFF HAND
BUT THEY HAVE M MAYBE A BIT OVER A THETA BYTE WORTH OF WEB PAGES IN THIS A BUNCH OF SERVERS
UH
YEAH MAYBE WIKIPEDIA IS A GOOD THING TO DO
WAS I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WIKIPEDIA THOUGH WAS THAT IT'S WHILE IT HAS A HIGH LEVEL OF INSIDE LINKS THAT HAS A LOT OF DIRECTORY STYLE LINKS AS WELL THAT MIGHT MESS UP IT ACTUALLY BEING A SEE WH WHILE YOU HAVE
AH OKAY THAT'S GOOD
THAT PLUS I GUESS IT'S ACTUALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO SAY TO START WITH IS THIS A SMALL WORLD NETWORK AND THEN RUN IT ON THAT
YOU WERE RUNNING THAT ON WHAT WE WHAT WAS IT LIKE HALF A MILLION PAGES SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IS IT AND THAT WAS FOR HALF OF IT
UH IF I REMEMBER
OKAY
OKAY THE WHOLE THING WAS
MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
I MEAN I THINK OFF HAND THINKING ABOUT THIS MODEL IT WOULD HAVE TO WORK BETTER BECAUSE TWO THINGS IN THE SAME CATEGORY ARE GOING TO BE LINKED
SO IT IT YEAH
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S I THINK THA IT'S GONNA BE MORE TRUE IN SOME NETWORKS AND IN SOME TASKS THAN OTHERS
AND I THINK IN THE WIKIPEDIA IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE IT'S A GOOD ONE TO TEST ON
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH IT I'LL MAYBE I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THE WIKIPEDIA STUFF ANYWAY
I'M STUCK DOING SOMETHING ELSE FOR THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO ANYWAY SO
UH THIS IS ALWAYS THE CASE
UH THE THERE'S ANOTHER THING UM UH THIS WAS NEW BUT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TOO MUCH
BUT IT'S ON THE SAME LINES IN THAT UH HAVE HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THIS UH CORRELATED TOPIC MODELS WORK
CORRELATED TOPIC MODELS
IT'S DAVID BLEI THE GUY THAT CAME UP WITH UH WITH L. D. A.
HE'S GOT UH A NEW MODEL THAT'S IT'S PUBLISHED IN NIPS THIS YEAR BUT HIS CO AUTHOR PUT IT ON THEIR WEB SITE A MONTH OR TWO AGO
SO UH YOU KNOW L. D. A.
D YOU ALL KNOW L. D. A. OR YEAH
UH OKAY
SO A L. D. A. YOU BASICALLY DRAW A A DIRICHLET WHICH SAYS LIKE WHAT TYPE OF DOCUMENT THIS IS EFFECTIVELY
AND THEN YOU DRAW A TOPIC GIVEN THAT DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION AND THEN YOU DRAW WORDS GIVEN THAT
ALRIGHT WELL THAT'S FOR FOR EVERY WORD AND THAT'S ONCE FOR THE DOCUMENT AND THAT'S YOU'VE GOT A PARAMETER COMING AT THIS GLOBALLY
SO THAT THAT'S ROUGHLY WHAT THE MODEL IS PLUS OTHER LITTLE BITS
BUT ANYWAY SO WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY THEY REWORKED THIS BECAUSE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH L. D. A.
AND I THINK P. L. S. A. HAS THIS PROBLEM AS WELL IN IS THAT UH THE MORE TOPICS YOU HAVE
THE LESS UH EXPRESSIVE IT CAN BE
BECAUSE THE TOPICS IT CLUSTER IT IT PUSHES A DOCUMENT IF IT IS PULLING A DOCUMENT INTO ONE TOPIC IT PUSHES ANOTHER TOPIC AWAY FROM THAT
DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE
SO THE TOPICS ARE NECESSARILY TRYING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER
SO THE MORE TOPICS YOU HAVE THE MORE TH THEY'RE SORT OF SQUEEZING INTO THE SPACE OF WHAT THINGS CAN BE ABOUT UH AND THINGS ARE KINDA PUSHED OUT
SO ONCE YOU M GO OVER YOU TRY IT ONE CORPUS
AND ONCE YOU GO OVER ABOUT A HUNDRED MAYBE TWO HUNDRED TOPICS
UH THE THE NEW YOU ADD MORE TOPICS AND IT DOESN'T GET BETTER IN ANY WAY THE MODEL DOESN'T
THE N NEW TOPICS ARE EFFECTIVELY GOING TO JUST BE GARBAGE
UH ALRIGHT SO WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY THEY THEY STOPPED USING THE DIRICHLET AND UH THEY'RE STARTING TO USE UH A GAUSSIAN THERE
SO IT IT IN TO SPARE THE DETAILS BASICALLY THEY'VE THEY'VE GOT A VARIABLE HERE
I THINK THEY CALL IT ETA UH AND THEY FROM THIS GENERATE A DISTRIBUTION OF TOPICS IN SOME WAY
BUT IT'S GENERATED FROM A GAUSSIAN SPACE FROM A FROM A A SPACE SO IT'S GIVEN A A MEAN AND COVARIANCE UH AND
YEAH UH SO WHAT IT DOES THE THIS IS THE THE BIT THAT TOOK ME FOREVER TO UNDERSTAND ACTUALLY UH SAME MODEL
BUT THIS IS GIVEN A GAUSSIAN SPACE IT MAPS THAT DOWN INTO THE SIMPLEX OF WHAT A TOPIC CAN BE ABOUT
THE SO THE SIMPLEX BASICALLY IF YOU'VE GOT A SAY YOU'VE GOT TWO TOPICS
NOW SAY I I SAY YOU GET THREE TOPICS THAT MAKES MORE EASIER TO DRAW
UH FOR THIS IS THETA ONE THETA TWO THETA THREE
THESE ARE THE PROBABILITIES THAT THAT A DOCUMENT IS ABOUT UH THIS THETA ONE IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS ABOUT TOPIC ONE
THETA TWO IS SO THESE GUYS ALL HAVE TO ADD UP TO ONE YEAH
UH SO THAT BASICALLY MEANS THAT WHAT A DOCUMENT IS ABOUT LIES ON THIS SPACE BETWEEN THEM YEAH
SO THIS IS THE SIMPLEX
UH SO BASICALLY A DISTRIBUTION GENERATED BY THIS GUY IS BASICALLY A POINT ON THIS SIMPLEX
SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY'VE GOT A DISTRIBUTION THAT MAPS UH A GAUSSIAN AND SOME SPACE INTO A DISTRIBUTION ON THIS THING
SO IT MAPS IT INTO GAUSSIAN IN THAT
THE COOL THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT TWO GAUSSIANS YOU CAN TELL HOW CLOSE THEY ARE
SO YOU CAN NOW TELL HOW CLOSE TWO TOPIC DISTRIBUTIONS ARE RIGHT
SO YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY AS YOU LIKE UH AND YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'RE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
SO THERE'S LOAD OF IDEAS THAT I HAD ABOUT THIS UH IN THAT IF YOU CAN TELL THAT TWO TOPIC DISTRIBUTIONS ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SPLIT A DOCUMENT INTO TWO PARTS AND SAID THAT THE TWO PARTS HAVE TO BE CLOSE IN THE DISTRIBUTION
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE DOC T THE DOCUMENT CHANGES FOR EXA STU STUFF BASED ON THAT
WITH THIS IDEA WHAT IF RATHER THAN WORKING WITH THIS P. OF Z. GIVEN D. THING THAT YOU HAD FROM P. L. S. A.
BUT WHAT IF YOU WORKED FROM THESE GAUSSIANS THAT YOU GET FOR EVERY DOCUMENT AND YOU SAID THAT IN SOME SOME FUNCTION THAT SAID UH THAT THE GAUSSIAN REPRESENTING THIS SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE ONES LINKING TO IT
NOW I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT ANY OF THE MATHS FOR THIS
BUT BUT IT SHOULD BE UH STRAIGHTFORWARD I GUESS TO TO FORMULATE A BASIC IN TERMS OF THE MEAN SHOULD BE SIMILAR AND THE COVARIANCE MAYBE SHOULD BE SIMILAR AS WELL
SO IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A BETTER MODEL AGAIN
I DUNNO
I'LL SEND YOU GUYS THE LINK FOR THAT CORRELATED TOPIC MODEL STUFF IF YOU WANT BUT UH I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TOO INTERESTING TO YOU
OKAY
ALRIGHT WELL THAN THANKS FOR HEARING ME OUT AND THE IDEA ESPECIALLY
MAYBE I CAN DO MORE WITH THIS
ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH B
BASTIEN YOU CAN'T RELEASE THIS DATA FOR FOUR MONTHS
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
IT IS THE INITIALISATION OF
YEAH
BUT THEN IT IS ITERATIVE
OKAY
SO YOU YOU SHOULD FIRST TRAIN THE P. L. S. A. STUFF THEN YOU INITIALISE THIS LINK UH SPREADING THING AND THEN YOU ITERATE OVER OKAY
AND IT CONVERGE AND SO YOU HAVE THE BOOST UH INITIAL P. L. S. A. AND P. L. S. A. PLUS THE LINK THING THEN
YEAH
MM
YEAH
SO TH YEAH YOU YOU YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO EVALUATE THAT NOW
YEAH RIGHT
HMM
BUT BUT MAYBE YOU YOU COULD HAVE SOME SOME OTHER LABELLI LI OR THE TASK LIKE IF IF YOU IMAGINE YOU HAVE SOME LABELLING ON OF OF THE WEB PAGES LIKE LIKE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU YOU LOOK AT AT AT AT AT A SET OF PAGES
AND YOU HAVE THE M THE DIRECTORY ENTRIES OF THESE PAGES SO SO F LIKE YAHOO OR ENTRIES
SO YOU HAVE CATEGORIES AND AND ENTRIES SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE I DUNNO CARS S. U. V. ETCETERA
SO WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE WOULD BE THAT TWO PAGES ON IN THE SAME UM CATEGORY SHOULD BE CLOSER THAN THAN TWO PAGES BEING SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT CATEGORIES
BUT YOU YOU WOULD NOT USE THIS YOU WILL NOT USE THE YAHOO DIRECTORY OR N THE DIRECTORY IN THE TRAINING STEP OF I OF THE MODEL OKAY
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE JUST FOR EVALUATION
AND THEN FOR EXAMPLE YOU YOU YOUR TASK WOULD BE TO SAY I HAVE SOME PAGE AND AND I KNOW WHERE IT IS IN THE IN THE IN THE DIRECTORY
AND I HAVE ANOTHER PAGE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS
AND I WOULD LIKE TO TO KNOW UH WHETHER IT IS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE FIRST ONE
JUST BY COMPARING THEIR UH ASPECTS
IF THEY HAVE THE SAME UH YEAH
SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHECK IF IS IS IS THERE SOME SIMILARITY IN THE IN THE IN THE ASPECT DISTRIBUTION
TELLS ME UH SOMETHING ABOUT UH THE SIM THE THE FACT THAT THEY COULD BE ON THE SAME CATEGORY IN THE THE THIS END END LABEL CATEGORIES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
NO NO NO NO NO
HOW WOULD
SO SO SO W WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAVE BASICALLY WOULD BE TO HAVE A DIRECTORY WHICH GIVE YOU LABELS FOR SOME PART OF THE DOCUMENTS
OKAY SO THIS IS A DIRECTORY AND THIS IS SOME SOME SOME SOME WEB PAGE OKAY
SO THE LABELLED ONE OKAY
AND YOU HAVE SOME PAGE WHICH ARE UNLABELLED BUT YOU HAVE LINKS BETWEEN THOSE TWO
SO WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS THAT YOU WOULD TRY AND P. L. S. A. AND AND UH AND USE A MODEL OVER THAT
THEN THEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT F WHAT COULD BE VERY SIMPLE WOULD BE JUST TO THEN TO MATCH EACH PAGES LIKE THAT
SO LET'S SAY YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A A PAGE WHICH IS LABELLED AND YOU SAY OKAY
THE THE LABEL PAGE TWO SHOULD GET SHOULD BE THE ONE W WHICH IT IS THE MOST SIMILAR TO OR ANY KIND OF CLASSIFICATION RULES YOU CAN IMAGINE
AND SO AND SO YOU SAY OKAY
WHAT WHAT'S IF I FROM FROM THIS PAGE WHICH HAVE THE SIMILAR SO SO THE THE CRITERION WOULD BE TO COMPARE THOSE TWO DISTRIBUTION
OKAY AND THEN AND THEN YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASSIGN TO THIS DOCUMENT TOO WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW THE LABELS THE SAME ONE AS THIS ONE
AND AND HERE THAT YOU USE ONLY FOR TEST SO THIS IS YOUR
THEN YOU CAN EVALUATE HOW WRONG YOU ARE OR CU HOW CLOSE YOU ARE FROM THE REAL ASSIGNMENT THE RIGHT DIRECTORY CATEGORY
IN THIS WAY I THINK IT'S FAIR IF YOU KN IF YOU KNOW ONLY IF YOU KNOW ONLY THAT AND THAT AND WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCOVER IS THIS
THIS IS A R LIKE A REAL TASK
LIKE LIKE IF IF IF THIS DIRECTORY UH UH COMPANY WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THIS DIRECTORY TO NEW PAGES WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF HAVING HUMAN LABELLING
YEAH YOU HAVE T YOU USE THIS ONE
YOU YOU ONLY HAVE THE LABELS FOR SOME UH SMALL PART OF THE
SO
SO YOU YOU WOULD TRAIN IT YOU THIS IS THIS IS T T ALL ALL THOSE LINKS ARE KNOWN
THE LINKS BETWEEN SOME LABELLED DOCUMENT AND UNLABELLED DOCUMENT
I D I THINK YOU CAN DO IT AS A TWO STEP PROCESS
FIRST YOU YOU TRAIN UH WELL MAYBE S IT WOU COULD BE BETTER IF IF IF YOU TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT
BUT BUT MAYBE YOU CAN YOU CAN DO JUST A TWO STEP PROCESS FIRST ONE YOU HAVE THIS UH UNSUPERVISED TASK OVER BOTH P. L. AND P. U.
AND THEN YOU FROM THESE UNSUPERVISED STARTS YOU CAN KNOW WHICH DOCUMENT OF P. L. IS CLOSE FROM THE DOCUMENT OF P. U. OR THE REVERSE
AND YOU CAN INFER SOME LABEL TO A DOCUMENT OF P. L.
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT
YEAH
YEAH
BUT BUT HERE YOU CAN YOU YOU SAY GIVEN A RANDOM PAGE OF P. U. WHICH OF THOSE TWO MODEL IS MORE LIKELY TO TO TO TO TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THI THE PAGE OF P. L. WHICH IS THE MOST SIMILAR
SO YOU SO SO FROM THIS SO YOU TAKE ANY DISTRIBUTION COMPARISON THINGS
SO SO HOFFMANN IN HIS PAPER WAS DOING JUST COSINE SIMILARITY BUT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
SO SO YOU JUST COMPARE UH THOSE TWO DISTRIBUTIONS SO OF D. ONE AND D. TWO OKAY
AND SO WITH THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN DETERMINE FOR EXAMPLE FOR A DOCUMENT O OF THE SET TWO TO THE MOST SIMILAR
SO YOU YOU YOU YOU SELECT D. ONE SO IN THIS SET WHICH IS THE MOST SIMILAR TO D. TWO ACCORDING TO THE DISTRIBUTION FROM ONE OR THE OTHER MODEL
AND THEN AND THEN FOR THIS DOCUMENT YOU AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN TO IT THE LABEL OF THE DOCUMENT UH ONE
AND YOU CHECK WITH THIS WHICH IS YOUR UH YOUR YOUR IF YOU ARE RIGHT OR NOT
THIS IS WHAT WHAT THIS IS VERY RELATED TO WHAT FRANK DID WITH THE WITH THE KEYWORD UH IMAGE ANNOTATION
SO YOU WOULD HAVE A SET OF KEYWORDS THE SET OF IMAGE LABEL WITH KEYWORDS AND HE HAS A SET OF UNLABELLED IMAGE WITH SOME
AND IT WOULD CHECK WHETHER THE THE LABEL HE ASSIGNS SO IN THIS CASE ANNOTATION WORD H ARE CORRECT
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR UH IT'S FAIR UH SETUP
SO MAYBE THIS CLASSIFICATION RULE IS NOT THE BEST
THERE THERE'S SOME MIGHT BE SOME WORK TO DO BUT THE GENERAL IDEA I THINK IT'S IT'S FAIR EVALUATIONS IT'S A TASK
THAT CAN BE DEP
YEAH
YEAH
NO BUT ACCORDING TO THIS DIRECTORY YEAH
YEAH
I I I THINK IT'S W
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT'S GOOD WITH THE DIRECTORY IS THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD COVERAGE OF VARIOUS TOPIC HUMANS HUMANS CAN LABEL
BUT THEN IF YOU WANT TO DETECT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THIS IS ANOTHER TASK
I THINK THE TASK OF THIS LATENT MODEL IS TO DISCOVER SOME SOME SEMANTIC LIKE SOME TOPIC PROXIMITY BETWEEN DOCUMENTS
AND HERE THIS LA THIS DIRECTORY IS DOING THE SAME THING LIKE ASSOCIATING SOME TOPICS WITH SOME DOCUMENTS MANUALLY
SO COMPARING THEM IS IS IS IS GOOD SETUP WITH RESPECT TO THE GOAL
I COMPARE THOSE TWO LIKE THE P. L. S. A. AND THE ONE OVER THIS SAME TASK OF ASSIGNING GOOD DIRECTORY
I DON'T KNOW IF IF IT IF IT WILL PROVIDE GOOD RESULT RESULT OR NOT BUT IT IS CLEARLY A BENCHMARK FOR THOSE TWO GOALS
ON ON THE INFRA YEAH YEAH
YEAH
LIKE BAG O YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN HAVE TREE SETUPS UH YEAH
YEAH BASIC COSINE OVER THE P. OF T. GIVEN D. SO OVER ALL THIS UH EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION
AND THE TWO UH ASPECT UH MODELS
WE HAVE TO REPEAT OVER AND OVER
THIS IS LIKE ADVERTISEMENT
NO NO IT'S JOKE
NO IT'S JUS
YEAH YEAH
THIS IS REALLY YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE Z. THE THE THE ASPECT LIKE THE Z. ARE ARE ARE COME UNSUPERVISELY
IT'S IT'S MORE LIKE IF YOU WERE GIVING THE PEOPLE YOU YOU SAID TO THEM OKAY
UH DIVIDE ME THIS BUNCH OF DOCUMENTS INTO FIVE TOPICS AND YOU DON'T GIVE THEM THE TOPICS A PRIORI YOU KNOW
SO THE TWO PERSON COULD COME UP WITH VERY DIFFERENT ONE IS VERY INTERESTING I IN
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
SO I I THINK I THINK IT'S YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT EVE EV EVEN SOMEONE WOULD WOULD PROVIDE VERY DIFFERENT LABELS LIKE LIKE SOMEONE WOULD SAY IT'S A PAGE IN ENGLISH
SOMEONE WOULD SAY IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A WEB PAGE UH WH WHICH HAS VERY FEW UH INFORMATION IN IT OR ANYTHING
SO I THINK THERE'S NO HARD CLUSTERING
AND WHAT'S GOOD WITH THOSE MODEL IS THAT THEY THEY CAN THEY THEY ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE YOU SOME SOME KIND OF WAY TO COMPARE TWO DOCUMENTS RATHER THAN TO GIVE YOU PRE DEFINED SETS OF DOCUMENTS
THIS IS NOT HARD CLUSTERING
THE O I I DON'T THINK ONE ONE ONE ASPECT OR ONE LATENT TOPIC HAS ANY SENSE BY HIS OWN
IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE THE WORD SET AND THE WORD DISTRIBUTION THAT YOU C YOU CAN TELL SOMETHING
IF YOU JUST TAKE ONE OF THEM ALONE
SO YOU TAKE ALL THE P. OF Z. GIVEN D. AND ALL OF THE P. OF W. GIVEN GIV GIVEN Z. YOU YOU YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH THAT
IT'S IT'S THE WHOLE SET
I WOULD SAY AN AN AND THIS IS OH IT IT SHOULD BE EVALUATED
MEANING THAT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE UH THE THE EXAMPLE ABOUT MARBLES IS THAT THE POINT WHAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM ALL THESE SETS MADE BY PEOPLE IS THAT IS THAT THOSE TWO THOSE TWO MARBLE WOULD BE CONSIDER AS MORE LIKELY TO BE IN THE SAME SETS
BECAUSE THEY THEY SHARE SOME COMMON PROPERTIES WHICH ARE NOT SEEN AS THE SAME FOR EVERY ONE
BUT THEY SHARE SOME COMMON PROPERTIES THAT PEOPLE WILL NOTICE
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TWO THE D ALL POSSIBLE PAIRS OF MARBLE
YOU WOULD HAVE SOME MU MUCH MORE AGREEMENT BETWEEN PEOPLE THAN THAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREDEFINED SETS PEOPLE WOULD WOULD JUST CUT AT SOME PRECISE UH POINT
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
YEAH
YEAH
WELL YOU DON'T YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TWO CLUSTERING NO NO NO NO YOU DON'T YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TWO CLUSTERING
NO NO NO NO YOU DON'T HAVE TWO CLUSTERING OF OF OF MARBLES
WHAT YOU HAVE IS Y IS YOU HAVE IS YOU HAVE ONE CLUSTERING OF MARBLE WHICH IS THIS ONE
AND THEN YOU HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE TELLING YOU I CONSIDER THOSE MARBLES AS VERY UH HAVE TO HAVE VERY SALIENT FEATURE THAT THEY SHARE IN COMMON
I I C I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE IN THE SAME CLUSTER
AND YOU C AND AND AND THOSE TWO SO AND ONE OF THEM IS LABELLED AND THE OTHER IS NOT LABELLED
SO YOU LOOK AT THAT YOU SAY OH SOMEONE TOLD THIS ONE WAS VERY SIMILAR
AND THIS ONE IS SAID TO BE BLUE FOR EXAMPLE I DUNNO IF IT'S THE LABEL
SO I PUT IT IN THE BLUE BAG
BUT BUT YOU DON'T YOU NEVER USE THE BLUE BAG YOU DON'T ASK THE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE BLUE BAG
YOU JUST LOOK AT THE PEOPLE YOU YOU JUST HAVE THE PEOPLE TO COMPARE THOSE TWO MARBLES
AND THEN IT HAPPENS THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN CLUSTERED
AND AND
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THIS IS I REVERSE BOTH ROLE
THE THIS IS THE PLAYERS
I I NO NO NO NO NO
IT COMES UP WITH NOT WITH THE CLUSTERING BUT WITH SOME WAY TO COMPARE TWO MARBLES OKAY
SOME WOULD SAY WOULD SAY I CONSIDER THOSE TWO ONES ARE COMPLETELY DISSIMILAR AND THE OTHER ONES SAY THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR
AND IF YOU FIND THAT IN YOUR UNL UNLABELLED CLUSTERING THOSE TWO UH BALLS UH MARBLES HAPPEN TO BE IN THE SAME UH CLUSTER
YOU SAID THE USER ALGORITHM MIGHT BE WRONG
BUT YOU AVERAGE THAT OVER LOTS OF DOCUMENTS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THEY MAKE SENSE ONLY SO GLOBAL OPTIMISATION THE LIKELIHOOD IS OPTIMISABLE GLOBALLY OVER THE WHOLE ASPECTS ETCETERA
SO IT'S IT'S YOU NEVER ASK THE MODEL TO DO HARD CLUSTERING OF DOCUMENTS
YOU JUST UH ASK UH IT TO FIND A DISTRIBUTION OVER ASPECTS SUCH THAT A DOCUMENT UH IS MORE LIKELY ACCORDING TO THE RESTRICTION THAT THE NUMBER ASPE ASPECT IS LIMITED
AND AND SO IT THE IT JUST MAKES SENSE ON THE UH LOOKING AT THE WHOLE SET
SO Y I THINK ALL EVALUATION SHOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND LOOK AT THE WHOLE ASPECT SET
LIKE HERE YOU LOOK AT THE ASPECT SET BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THE SIMILARITY OF TWO DISTRIBUTION
AN ANY ST ANY KIND OF THING YOU WHERE YOU UN UNFOLD THE MODEL AND LOOK AT IT MANUALLY
LOOKS WEIRD LIKE LIKE IN THOSE HOFFMANN PAPERS WHERE SHOW YOU COLUMNS WITH WORDS OR THINGS
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT ALSO IT DEPENDS ON THAT COULD BE A GOOD EFFECT
BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU CAN BE IF YOU CAN IF YOU ARE UH HIGHLY RELIABLE ABOUT ONE PAGE
BUT ALL THE PAGE LINKING TO IT ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT VERY DIFFERENT TOPICS
SO YOU COULD SAY MAYBE I WAS WRONG FROM DECIDING ONLY DUE TO THE TEXT THAT THIS PAGE WAS ABOUT THIS ASPECT DISTRIBUTION
BECAUSE BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PAGES ARE VOTING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTION
WHILE THERE'S A BALANCE
HMM
YEAH
PEDRO'S ALWAYS SPEAKS ABOUT CARS
BUT I THINK FOR ANY KIND OF WAY YOU HAVE TO SELECT THOSE ALPHA YOU YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE EFFECT ON ON THE RE ON THE T EVALUATION TASK
AND THEN MAYBE YOU CAN FIND SOME PATTERNS THAT ARE THEN THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THE ONCE YOU HAVE THE TASK
YOU COULD LOOK AT AT WHICH PAGES ARE COMPLETELY MISSED BY ONE MODEL
WHICH OTHERS ARE ARE SUCCESSFUL WITH ONE MODEL AND AND YOU CAN MAYBE INFER SOME SOME RULES AFTERWARDS
BUT IF YOU HAVE NO TASK YOU CAN UH BLINDLY SELECT S GOOD ALPHAS
LIKE LIKE IF IF YOU LOOK AT UH IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR TASK AND YOU SEE THAT I DUNNO UH
THE THE LONG PAGES FOR EXAMPLE HAVE GOOD P. L. S. A. MODEL WITHOUT FUSING LINKS
SO THEN YOU CAN INFER SOME HEURISTICS LIKE OKAY THE ALPHA SHOULD BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE LENGTHS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
OR TO THE NUMBER OF IMAGE IN THE PAGES OR ANYTHING
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME SOME TASK WHERE YOU CAN INDIVIDUALLY LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE ON EVERY ON EVERY PAGE
AND AND AND AND AT AS A SECOND STEP YOU COULD INFER SOME KIND OF RULE ABOUT HOW TO SELECT ALPHAS WITH RESPECT TO THE TASK
MAYBE IT'S V IT'S VERY SIMPLE RULES BUT SELECT THEM BLINDLY S MIGHT BE ODD
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT BUT BUT STILL LI LIKE THE THE THE WORK I DID ON ON HYPERLINKS LIKE I USED UH WIKIPEDIA
I I THINK IT'S G BECAUSE IT HAS FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL OF INSIDE LINKS BETWEEN
YEAH
WELL YOU CAN CATEGORISE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE TH IT'S THERE'S A STRUCTURE ON THE ON THE WEB PAGE
SO YOU YOU CAN SELECT ONLY THE LINKS WHICH ARE WITHIN THE ARTICLE OR WITHIN THE CATEGORIES OR IT'S IT'S IT'S WELL STRUCTURED IT'S IT'S UH EASY TO MANIPULATE AND
YEAH
YOU CAN EVEN ISOLATE THE DIRECTORY FROM THE CATEGORIES OF WIKIPEDIA
WELL YEAH ACTUALLY I I I DIVIDED IN THREE EQUAL SIZE PARTS WHICH HAVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOCUMENTS
THERE ARE A THOUSAND DOCUMENTS
AND WELL BUT
WELL WHAT I DID WITH THE LINK WELL BUT THIS IS NOT TH EXACTLY THE SAME SETUP YOU WOULD HAVE
SO IN THIS SETUP THE WHOLE LINK STRUCTURE COULD BE KNOWN
AND THE ONLY THING YOU WOU DON'T YOU W DON'T KNOW WOULD BE THE ASSIGNATION TO UH TO A CATEGORY
IN MY SETUP IT WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE I I SH I COULDN'T USE THE LINKS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SETS
BUT THIS IS NOT I DON'T WANT TO MESS YOU UP WITH THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME KIND OF EXPERIMENT
BUT YOU COULD JUST USE THE WHOLE CORPUS LIKE THIS AND AND FOR SOME OF THEM YOU ASSUME YOU DON'T KNOW THE THE CATEGORY ASSIGNMENT
AND THEN YOU CAN RUN THIS SET OF EXPERIMENTS OVER WIKIPEDIA
YEAH
BUT THIS IS THE YEAH THIS IS THE HYPOTHESIS BETWEEN THIS UH IN THIS P. L. S. A. WITH LINK STUFF
OH YEAH I THI
YEAH
BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN THINK ALSO AT AT OTHER UH TASK LIKE THAT
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN TAKE PROCEEDINGS AND ASSUME THE CATEGORIES ARE THE KEYWORDS OF THE OF THE D OF THE DOCUMENTS
AND THEN IF YOU HAVE THE ARCHIVE OF A JOURNAL YOU CAN YOU CAN USE THE L THE LINKS BETWEEN UH THE CITATION LINKS
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A BIGGER STUFF SO WIKIPEDIA WOULD BE KIND OF VERY SMALL WITH LOTS OF ENGLI IN LINKS
AND THEN IF YOU TAKE A JOURNAL YOU WILL HAVE LESS LINKS AND AND MORE DOCUMENTS
AND THEN YOU WOULD BE LIKELY TO SAY THAT P. L. S. A. MIGHT BE BETTER OVER THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LINKS
SO YOU YOU YOU CAN FIND EXAMPLES WHICH ARE NOT THE WEB I THINK IT'S GOOD TO WORK IN CLOSED SET
WIKIPEDIA IS KIND OF CLOSED SET MA EVEN IF THERE'S LOTS OF OUTSIDE LINKS BUT THERE'S LOTS OF INSIDE LINKS
YOU HAVE TO THINK AT AT AT AT AT AT AT DATABASE WHERE THERE'S LOT OF IN LINKS
WIKIPEDIA MIGHT BE ONE CITATION FOR EXAMPLE IF IF YOU TAKE THE NIPS ARCH ARCHIVE WHICH IS AVAILABLE
NIPS AUTHOR ALWAYS OTHER NIPS AUTHOR WHICH ARE OFTEN THEMSELVES ETCETERA
WELL IT'S REPORTED I I WON'T SAY
SO BUT BUT BUT BUT YEAH I THINK TH TH THIS KIND OF SETUP MAYBE WEB PAGES IT'S HARD TO FIND
SETS OF WEB PAGES WHICH HAVE GOOD LINKS STUFF IF YOU START FROM ONE PAGE OR SOMETHING
OKAY
BUT IT'S DISCRETE UH NO THE
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
'KAY YEAH THANKS
OKAY YEAH
WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD IDEAS THAT ARE RECORDED AND SOMEONE WILL
YEAH
BECAUSE THE DATA LIKE WILL BE RELEASED VERY SOON
SO IS IT CORRECT OR NO
HMM
YEAH
WELL SO WE HOPE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OH THIS IS IS FROZEN FROZEN OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
PERPLEXITY UH
YEAH
OH NO RE NO I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE THE YOU SAID I WOULD TELL YOU THAT EVALUATION SHOULD BE DONE BASED ON LIKELIHOOD OR PERPLEXITY
WELL IT'S BU YEAH IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME BUT
I DUNNO
YEAH ANOTHER TASK OR
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO NO NO I NO NO NO NO IT'S DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT IF IF YOU USE THE LATENT REPRESENTATIONS OR DISTRIBUTION OVER ASPECTS
YOU COULD USE THIS TO SAVE TWO DOCUMENTS UH IN THE SAME DIRECTORY OR NOT
AND THIS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THEN
UM
YEAH
CLEARLY WHA WE WE HAD DONE THESE
YOU CAN TRAIN AFTER THAT UH AN S. V. M. SAYING THIS IS CATEGORY ONE OR TWO ON THE LABEL DOCUMENT
AND THEN WE WILL HAVE AN UNLABELLED DOCUMENT AND YOU JUST SAY THIS IS DIRECTORY ONE OR TWO
AND IF IT SHOULD IMPROVE IT IF YOU SAY THIS FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS IS BETTER THAN YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER CLEANER SEPARATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO
YEAH WELL BUT
YEAH WELL BUT I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TO JUDGE IT'S WITH RESPECT TO A GIVEN TASK
I MEAN YOU CAN'T SAY OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S MAXIMISING THE LIKELIHOOD OF WHATEVER
YEAH
MM
YEAH IT'S THE SAME
MM-HMM
FUS
MM-HMM
YEAH
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY WAY TO SAY GENERALLY THIS THIS IS BETTER OR WORSE
YEAH
IT HAS TO BE RE IT HAS TO BE REALLY TO WITH RESPECT TO THIS THIS CLUSTERING MAKES SENSE OR I DUNNO
YEAH
YOU CAN E EVEN KEEP THE BAG OF WORDS AND DO THE COSINE COMPARISON OR
JUST SHOWING JUST SHOWING HOW JUST FIRST HOW BETTER THIS IS WITH RESPECT TO BAG OF WORDS AND HOPEFULLY THEN HOW YOU NEW UH REGULARISED P. L. Z. GIVEN D. IS
I DUNNO JUST UH YEAH IT'S BASIC
MM-HMM
BUT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH JUST KNOW WHERE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
NO IT DOES
YEAH
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MATCH
YEAH
BUT YEAH IT JUST RE
MM-HMM
YEAH
BECAUSE THE THE LATENT ASPECTS REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO MATCH THE FINAL UH DIRECTORY CATEGORY
IT CAN BE ANYTHING BUT IT'S JUST A WAY OF SAYING YEAH THOSE DOCUMEN DOCUMENTS ARE SIMILAR IN SOME SENSE
SO
IS IT JUST IT JUST SOMETIME DANGEROUS TO SAY TH THESE LATENT ASPECTS MEANS THIS
YEAH I THINK YEAH
GOOD GOOD GOOD
MM-HMM
YEAH AND THE OTHERS USUALLY DON'T MEAN ANYTHING YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
FOR YOUR MODEL MM GOOD
NERD
NERD
MM
YEAH CARS AND WEB
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WHICH ONES UH
NO NO
HMM
OKAY
WELL IN IN THREE MONTHS
OH YEAH IT'S TOO LATE THREE MONTHS
WE SHOULD WAIT
SO YEAH WE PUT THIS STUFF ON SO THAT SO THAT WE HAVE SOME RECORD OF THE WHOLE THING WHAT UH ARE GOING TO SAY
AND UH THE WHOLE IDEA HERE IS SAYS ALSO PUT THE LAPEL ON
UH THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS MEETING IS THAT IT'S NOT ME WHO WILL BE TALKING ALL THE TIME
SO SO THAT WOULD BE A BORING THAT WOULD BE DEFINITELY BORING MEETING
YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO I SO THE P THE ACTUALLY THE REASON WHY WE GOT TOGETHER IS THAT IT'S AB IT'S ABOUT THE TIME TO A. MAKE SURE THAT WHEN PETR LEAVES US UH I'M AFRAID IT MAY HAPPEN
RIGHT
I MEAN IT OR DID YOU DIDN'T CHANGE YOUR MIND YET
OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND DIDN'T CHANGE YOUR MIND
SO SO THAT WHATEVER HE'S WHATEVER HE'S BEEN DOING UH IS NOT UH FORGOTTEN AND THEN PEOPLE CAN STAY ON HIS SHOULDERS AND UH I HOPE THAT HE WON'T GET OUT ENTIRELY OUT OF UH OUT OF UH THIS PROBLEM
BUT STILL WE WE NEED TO CONTINUE ON THIS
SO I THINK THE JOEL WILL BE IS IS MY MAIN HOPE THAT HE'S UH HE'S GOING TO PICK UP UH THE KEY WORD SPOTTING AND SOME OF THESE IDEAS AND ALSO THE REASON WHY P UH I P UH UH PETR MOTLICEK IS HERE IS THAT JOEL IS ALSO GETTING INTERESTED IN UH OPAL MODELS OF UH TEM TEMPORAL ENVELOPE
YEAH AND OF OF COURSE PET UH PETR FOR SIGNALS
SO ABOUT IT BUT PETR MOTLICEK TOO
EH BOTH OF YOU YOU KNOW
SO BUT BUT BUT YOU WILL BE HERE AND FROM DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW EH
PETR MOTLICEK IS WORKING MAINLY ON SPEECH CODING
YEAH AND UH SO SO THIS IS UM YEAH I GUESS THIS IS IT
SO M I I GUESS THAT REALLY YOU SHOULD BE TALKING MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW
SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
AND UH
YEAH
OH THIS WERE HO HOW IT STARTED BASICALLY BECAUSE THAT WAS UH MARIOS ATHINEOS YEAH AND DAN ELLIS
THEY HAD A PAPER I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT IN ICASSP A. S. R. U. OR SOMETHING RIGHT
IT WAS A A. S. R. U. BUT THAT WAS A TIME WHEN THEY WEREN'T USING VERY LONG UH UH UH D UH SEGMENTS
IT WAS LIKE FIFTY MILLISECOND OR SOMETHING WHAT THEY WERE PLAYING WITH AT THE TIME
YEAH I KNOW
SO THEN I THE STORY WAS THAT THEN UH MARIOS PRESENTED THAT AT SO SOME MEETING AND WE REALISED OH
THAT MIGHT BE CUTE THING UH FOR UH ESTIMATING UH SPECTRAL ENERGIES
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT
AND WE'LL THE THE WAY WE'VE UH WE ARE DOING IT IS KIND OF I THINK IT WORKS BUT IT'S LITTLE BIT INELEGANT
SOMEHOW STUPID SO SO FIRST DO THE FRAME BY BASED UH ESTIMATE
AND THEN YOU YOU GET STICK TO HUNDRED HERTZ SAMPLING TEN MILLISECOND SAMPLING OR UH SOMETHING AND THEN YOU JUST PICK UP THE TRAJECTORY
SO SO MARIOS WAS HERE FOR HALF A YEAR MAYBE OR EVEN MORE UH AND UH STARTED WORK WITH PETR WHO ALSO J JUST CAME
SO THEY WERE WORKING LITTLE BIT TOGETHER
MAINLY M MARIOS WAS UH PROGRAMMING IN MATLAB AND PETR WAS PUTTING IT INTO FANCY IS YEAH AND UH BUT UH AND BUT THEN WE WERE HOPING UH UH UH TH TO PICK UP ON THAT LITTLE BIT MORE
AND WE WE DID RIGHT
YOU DID A LITTLE BIT OF WORK
YEAH
HMM
AND WE NEVER PUBLISHED THAT ANYWHERE RIGHT
HUH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WE WERE ALSO DOING A SERIOUS THING THAT WE WERE STEPPING IT BY TEN MILLISECOND RIGHT
AT THE TIME
RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
THAT WAS A REASONABLE START YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU MAY BE THE ONLY ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD NOW
BECAUSE UH BECAUSE CHI FONG IS GONE AND UH AND UH BARRY IS GONE
SO MORGAN WAS JOKING NO WHAT HE INFORMED ME THEY ARE GONE FROM ICSI
UH CHI FONG WENT TO T. I. AND UH AND UH UH UH B BARRY IS AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LAB
HE BASICALLY GOT A JOB
HE HE GRADUATED
AND HE'S HE'LL BE WORKING ON THINGS WHICH HE CANNOT TALK ABOUT
HE CAN'T EVEN SAY IT ON A MICROPHONE HERE I HEARD
IT'S UH I YEAH IT'S CLASSIFIED WORK TYPICALLY
IT'S AND SO SO JO MORGAN WAS H ONLY HALF JOKING
HE WAS S SOMEBODY WAS ASKING HIM YOU WERE OR SO S OR SOMEBODY WAS ASKING HIM SOMETHING
UH OR THERE WAS UH THERE WAS UH MATTHEW AND HE SAID WELL PROBABLY WE'LL BE COMING TO ASK YOU BECAUSE NOBODY REALLY KNOWS ANYMORE AT ICSI
SO PLEASE STAY
UH TH NOBODY
THAT WAS BARRY
AND NOW IT'S UH CL CLOSE HISTO ACTUALLY BRNO IS DOING A A LOT OF THAT NOW
THEY PICKED UP THE SOFTWARE AND THEY PLAY WITH THE AND NETS
SO THAT MIGHT BE THAT BRNO WILL BE AT THE SOONEST AS UH A ULTIMATE EXPERT ON ON THE WHOLE THING
N N WHERE WHICH SOFTWARE
NO THEY NE QUICKNET WAS DONE UH UH WELL QUICKNET ITSELF WAS DONE ACTUALLY LONG TIME AGO AT ICSI
IS THAT SO
GROUP
OKAY
SO WE H HAVE TO TREAT HIM WELL
WELL THE WHOLE IDEA THEN IS THAT THEN YOU START PLAYING WITH IT RIGHT
AND YOU YEAH AND
MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE THE
ON FRAME
OH
HE USED TO HAVE BEFORE HE LOST ALL THE DATA
BUT HE WILL HAVE IT AGAIN
YEAH
KNOWS MORE THAN THAN THAN I DO
S SO THAT'S GOOD
BUT CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE UH THE THE OPAL MODELLING OF TEMPORAL TRAJECTORIES
EVEN PE PETR FOUSEK IS NOT HERE YOU PROBABLY KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT BY NOW
NO
THAT UH UH AP APPROXIMATING HILBERT ENVELOPE BY OPAL MODEL
I A V A V. L. P.
UH AS AS I SAY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE NOT HERE THAT THAT PETR MOTLICEK KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT IT TOO
BECAUSE SAME AP YEAH DIFFERENT UH APPLICATION DIFFERENT UH DIFFERENT SOFTWARE OR SOMETHING
IF IF YOU MAKE A B BROADER BANDS
BECAUSE WHEN THE BAND IS NARROW THE C EXCITATION IS CLOSE THE CARRIER IS CLOSE TO S SINUSOID BASICALLY CO SINUSOID
YOU MAY ALMOST WANT TO DIS UH UM I B UH UH UH YEAH UH B USE THE WHITE BOARD
I MEAN UH AND UH THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IT HERE RIGHT SO THAT
I DON'T THINK SO
I THINK NO WE ARE WIRED
EXCEPT
PULSES
THIS IS L. P.
THIS IS A STANDARD TIME DOMAIN L. P. RIGHT
BUT SINCE YOU ARE IN A DIFFERENT DOMAIN THIS IS HE HERE WE ARE IN TIME DOMAIN RIGHT
BUT BUT YOU ARE YOU ARE REALLY IN A FREQUENCY DOMAIN
SO IT UH THE LINE'S TURNING TO INTO SINES RIGHT
AND YOU P AND SINCE THIS THIS I MEAN BECAUSE THIS THI THIS THIS SPECTRUM IS AL HAS ALSO LINE SPECTRUM RIGHT
I MEAN ALL COMPONENTS
SO IF YOU ARE THEN IF WE ARE IN A FREQUENCY TH YOUR SOURCE LOOKS LIKE THIS
AND
IT'S UH YEAH RIGHT
SO YOU KNOW THAT
AND THIS IS WHERE
AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM CURRENTLY IS THAT THE CARRIER IS ACTUALLY NOT COSINE BUT UH SOMETHING LITTLE BIT MORE UH UH INTERESTING
AND IF THE FREQUENCY DOESN'T CHANGE OVER THE WA OVER OVER THE LENGTHS OF THE UH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT BUT F F FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF HE UH BECAUSE OF PROPERTIES OF HEARING MORE OR LESS
FOR THE HIGHER BANDS YOU IF YOU PUT IN JUST S SOME GARBAGE SOME NOISE IT DOESN'T REALLY M W MATTER ALL THAT MUCH
IT W SOUNDS LITTLE BIT WORSE
BUT UH IT'S NOT A BIG TRAGEDY
UH WHERE YOU REALLY W IF YOU WANT TO G DO A GOOD VOICE SPEECH UH YOU'LL WANT TO GET THE LOWER BANDS CORRECT
AND IF YOU PUT IN UH NOISE ALTOGETHER IT SOUNDS LIKE A WHISPERED SPEECH UH BUT YOU UNDERSTAND PERFECT
BY NOISE
SO NOW WE HAVE TO KILL THEM BOTH
BECAUSE I MEAN GAVE ALL THE SECRETS AWAY
I MEAN QUAL COMPUTERS IS GOING TO
YES
IF MOTOROLA OR NOKIA GETS HOLD OF THIS UH TAPE THEN WE ARE IN TROUBLE
UH HOPEFULLY IT BY THEN IT WILL BE PROTECTED AND AND EVERYTHING RIGHT
IT'S IT'S UH IT'S BUT LISTEN THIS IS A SCIENCE
I MEAN IT'S UH CONFIDENTIAL TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE NOT UH I UH PUBLISHING IT YET
BUT WE W WE OF OF COURSE WE WILL
AND UH AND UH BUT UH WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT UH IF QUALCOMM HAS A INTEREST OF WHO'S FUNDING THE WORK THE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO UH TO TO PATENT IT OR SOMETHING
BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL
THIS IS NOT A PUBLIC UH PUBLIC UH PRESENTATION
SO THIS I IS NOT EVEN A PROBLEM
THE ONLY PROBLEM WOULD BE IF BUT YOU KNOW
NOBODY CAN BEAT P PETR UH PETR MOTLICEK ANYMORE IN I MEAN IF EVEN IF IF NOKIA KNOWS EVERYTHING IF YOU IF YOU SELL IT TOMORROW WHO DID YOU WORK FOR TH THE UH UH TEXT NO
T H. P. H. P.
THEY WILL TAKE HALF A YEAR BEFORE THEY WOULD EVEN REALISE WHAT IT IS
AND BY THEN SO IT'S NOT NO PROBLEM
OKAY
SO THAT'S WHERE THAT'S UH THAT'S UH
TO GET THE UH
WHEN YOU COMP UH W WHAT YOU COM WHEN YOU COMPRESS THE EFFECTIVELY THEY'LL WANT THE SIGNAL WHICH WE ARE MODELLING
AND UH SO THEN YOU GET THE FITTING TO COMPRESS SIGNAL
ESSENTIALLY IF YOU WERE IN SPECTRAL DOMAIN YOU WOULD COMPRESS THE POWER SPECTRUM
HERE YOU COMPRESS THE THE TH THIS TH THIS I THE WHAT FUL YEAH OF D. C. T. OF OF THE SIGNAL RIGHT
AND SO THE W THEN YOU HAVE UH PREDICTOR IS FITTING ACTUALLY THIS COMPRESS SIGNAL
BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH C IT WAS COMPRESSED
SO YOU CAN ALWAYS EXPAND IT BACK SO THAT YOU GET THE C THAT YOU GET A FIT TO THE TO THE ORIGINAL THING
EXCEPT THAT IF IT IS DIFFERENT
BECAUSE UH IT HA TH BASICALLY THIS OPAL MODELING HAS A DIFFERENT PROPERTIES
AND UH IT'S
SO WE CAN TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT
THIS IS AN UH SORT OF OLD TECHNIQUE WHICH UH IT
AND IT WAS MY THESIS EVEN
P. H. D. THESIS ACTUALLY
A SMALL SORRY
YEAH IT WAS S. T. L. P. WAS CALLED SPECTRAL TRANSFORM LINEAR PREDICTION
IT WAS MY FIRST ICASSP PAPER EVER
IT WAS UH IT NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE BOSTON
YOU GUYS WERE STILL IN KINDERGARTEN RIGHT
OH THIS IS TERRIBLE
SO BUT NO NOBODY NOBODY WAS USING IT FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT IT WAS CUTE
BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT
AND UH AND BUT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IS SINCE SINCE WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE WE ARE NORMAL L. P. C. IS FITTING UH PEAKS RIGHT
BUT WHEN YOU ARE MODELING HILBERT ENVELOPE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO FIT ONLY PEAKS
YOU SOMETIMES WANT TO GET A BASICALLY GOOD ESTIMATE OF THE OF THE ENVELOPE
SO THAT HELPS YOU
BECAUSE IN THIS UH THI THI THIS SPECTRAL TRANSFORM ALLOWS YOU TO TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN HOW WELL IT FITS PEAKS
HOW HOW WELL IT FITS DIPS AND UH AND YEAH
AND SORT OF THE SO THIS IS G SO I THINK THAT BASICALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I MEAN YOU SHOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS RIGHT
SO
YEAH
SAPA
AND THEN YEAH THIS IS A THIS THEY ARE TWO PAPERS IN UH ONE IS IN SAPA ONE IS IN UH U. INTERSPEECH
UH IN A C CHEJU
AND ONE WAS IN THE A. S. R. U.
IT WAS FROM VIRGIN ISLANDS
SAPA WAS A S I I TELL YOU WHAT IT STANDS FOR STATISTIC AND AD AND SOMETHING AD AND UH PERCEPTUAL APPROACHES
I WAS ON F I WAS ON A F W S ORGANISING COMMITTEE
I SHOULD KNOW
BUT STATISTIC AND UH AND SOMETHING APPROACHES
UH PE PERCEPTUA AND STATISTICS AND PERCEPTUAL A APPROACHES
THAT WAS UH
BUT THEY ARE THE SAME RIGHT AS UH AS UH AND THEN ALSO IS THERE IS SOME MORE WORK ACTUALLY CAN BE TRACED DOWN
I THINK THERE WA UH THE READING LES ATLAS'S PAPERS ARE VERY GOOD
BECAUSE LES ATLAS IS DOING A LOT OF WORK ON CODING IN THIS DOMAIN
HE DOESN'T USE OPAL MODEL
BUT HE USES D. C. T. AND THEN HE P UH SO THE SO SO AND IT AND LES IS EXCELLENT GUY
HE'S VERY GOOD MATHEMAT MM H VERY GOOD THEORETICIAN
BASICALLY HE'S A HE'S AT STANFORD THE GUY
AND UH REALLY HE LIKES TO WRITE THINGS WELL
SO HE'S VERY RIGOROUS UH AS OPPOSED TO S TO ME FOR INSTANCE
SO IF YOU READ THAT THEN IT THEN YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO ERRORS AND
YEAH UH BUT UM SO WHATEVER YOU G WHATEVER YOU GET HANDS ON FROM LES ATLAS UH FOR OVER PAST FIVE YEARS UH REGARDI THIS TWO YEARS AGO
LAST YEAR ON ONE OF THE ICASSPS HE HAD LIKE FIVE PAPERS RIGHT
OR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS BECAUSE UH HE'S EAGER TO
IS THAT SO
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT
YEAH
OR
UH-HUH
I DON'T
TO FILL IN YEAH WITH ALL KINDS OF PARAMETERS
HE HAS ALL KINDS OF SPEECH RECOGNITION RESULTS RIGHT
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU START USING THE CLUSTER I REMEMBER OR SOME UH SOME PARALLEL PROCESSING
THAT WAS A BIG THING HERE
EVERYBODY HATED HIM FOR T UH TEMPORARILY
I REMEMBER
UH-HUH
I YEAH I REMEMBER FRANK CAME TO ME AND SAYS IS EVERYBODY WAS COMPUTING LIKE MARIUS WE WOULD BE ALL DEAD
BUT I SAY FRANK BUT I WANT EVERYBODY TO COMPUTE LIKE MARIUS
AND
WELL IT IS IMPORTANT YOU KNOW
WHEREAS I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH WE NEVER TALK ABOUT RIGHT
I HEAR IT HOW MUCH WORK UH DOES PUT IN UH HERE
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE THIS THAT UH THAT THINGS SPED UP TREMENDOUSLY SINCE I CAME
I MEAN UH OF COURSE PARTIALLY BECAUSE THEY STARTED TO BUY SOME MORE UH MORE HARDWARE
BUT ALSO BE P SOME AT LEAST SOME PEOPLE BASICALLY KNOW HOW TO UH UH WRITE FASTER PROGRAMS
UH THIS IS FANTASTIC
AND USED TO BE TWO DAYS YEAH
UH
SO DO YOU ALREADY KNOW WHERE UH WHAT IS THE SITUATION WITH YOU
YOU GO BACK TO PRAGUE FOR A WHILE
AND THEN DID YOU GET ANYTHING IN F IN FRANCE
I GOT SOME IDEAS BY THE WAY
I YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH-HUH
OH IT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE WOULD BE A PITY RIGHT
YOU YOU CA YOU T SO YOU DON'T DIE OF HUNGER
AND SO YEAH
YEAH THAT'S NOT THE IDEA
NO
WE'LL WE'LL UH WE WILL WE'LL TRY SOMETHING LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
UM
SO JOEL YOUR MAIN BASICALLY THING IS AS I TOLD YOU TO T UH WHEN WE WERE WALKING THAT UH THAT WHAT WHATEVER PETR DID
THAT IT DOESN'T DIE BUT IT I IT CARRIES
AND OBVIOUSLY UH V WE VERY MUCH HOPE THAT YOU GET INTO THAT AND YOU GET EXCITED AND YOU DO S MORE AND UH OR UH MAYBE EVEN DIFFERENT THINGS
BUT UH
THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKS
IT'S NOT THAT IT DOESN'T WORK
UH
YEAH
THEN
AND I AND THIS AND THIS IS ALL ON THE RECORD
SO IF WE UH IF UH IF WE YOU CAN HOLD HIM TO HIS WORD
J JU YOU REWIND
BROWSE THROUGH THE MEETING
OKAY
HOW WE DOING TIME WISE
YEAH I THINK HALF HOUR IT'S FINE RIGHT
BUT YOU WILL BE HERE UNTIL ALMOST UNTIL END OF UH
YEAH
SO BREAKS MY HEART
IT'S JUST LIKE I WAS JUST START TEACHING AND THEN I N I'LL NEED AN ASSISTANT
HMM
YEAH MAYBE
UH YEAH
UH D HOPEFULLY IT'S MAKE M MAKES UH PAY PAY SOME EXTRA
SO WE'LL SEE
EITHER SPEECH
UH BUT IT'S CO ACTUALLY COMPILATION OF UH REALLY COMPILATION OF TWO CLASSES I WAS GIVING AT O. G. I. WHICH IS LIKE SPEECH PROCESSING AND AND UH PERCEPTION
AND SO I TRIED TO PUT IT TOGETHER SO THAT IT MAKES SOME SENSE
NO
NO
I'VE IT'S UH I IT I SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST FOUR
BECAUSE THIS IS A P LIKE UH GRADUATES
BUT I HAVE ONE ALRIGHT
GUARANTEED
I HAVE ONE GUARANTEED THAT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE IS UH
UH UH
SORRY
I S I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS TO BE FOUR CREDIT OR NOT
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I LIKE PEOPLE WITHOUT UH N NOT TAKING IT FOR CREDIT BECAUSE THEN THEY JUST SIT THERE AND HAVING GOOD TIME
BUT IT'S OKAY
NO NO IT'S OKAY
YEAH
GUILLERMO IS TAKING VERY GOOD
AND SO I'LL I. S. WHO ALREADY HAVE AT LEAST TWO
IF UH
YEAH WE PRO I PROBABLY GET FOUR
AND UH IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT'S FOR SURE
I MEAN THAT'S
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH THE NOTES NOTEBOOKS
UH-HUH
BUT THAT'S GOOD YOU KNOW
IT'S UH
I DIDN'T GET INTO TOO MANY THINGS ACTUALLY
WE KNOW THE REASON WAS THAT AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT I WAS TEACHING WITH HERVE
AND WE THOUGHT I WE HAVE MUCH MORE TIME
AND SUDDENLY WE RAN OUT OF TIME BASICALLY BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT UH IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THREE HOUR LECTURE
BUT IT WAS ONLY TWO HOUR LECTURE
AND UH HERVE ASSUMED THAT IT'S GOING TO RUN LONGER
OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE ASSUMED
BUT SUDDENLY WE SA S HE SAID WELL SO SO WHERE ARE YOU
I SAID WELL I'M JUST SLOWLY GETTING INTO L. P. C.
HE SAID WHY BUT I WE HAVE ONLY THREE MORE LECTURES
I HAVE TO TEACH H. M. M. AND EVERYTHING
SO I THE L. P. C. PART WAS LIKE I HAD TO DO IT IN ONE HOUR
AND THEN EVERYBODY WAS C TOTALLY CONFUSED I GUESS
AND
YEAH THEY WERE ALSO CONFUSED
YEAH
IT WAS AT D. B. F. L. YEAH
BUT
OH WE'LL SEE
OKAY GUYS
I THINK THAT UM THIS UNLESS SOMEBODY HAS UH STILL ANYTHING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
RIGHT IT'S UH JU IT'S A LITTLE BIT UP TO YOU
YOU HAVE TO P YOU HAVE TO BACK THIS UH UH HA H SPECIALLY PETR
BECAUSE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT AND YEAH
YEAH
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WILL BE DONE BY MAY
IS IT PLAN
I THINK SO
YEAH WE MADE A MISTAKE I TELL YOU
I THINK IF I HAD TO DO IT AGAIN AND WE MADE A MISTAKE WE SHOULD HAVE REGISTER YOU HERE AT E. P. F. L.
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A DEGREE BY NOW FROM E. P. F. L.
YEAH THAT WAS A MISTAKE
SORRY YOURS YOU WERE OR YOU WERE HERE T YOU WERE YOU WERE HERE HOW LONG YOU WERE HERE
TWO YEARS
YEAH
WHERE ARE THE
YEAH
RIGHT
SO IS SHE GETTING UH UH ANOTHER POSITION THERE
OR WHAT IS THE RE REASON OF WHAT A BOYFRIEND HUH
OH I SEE
SO THAT'S GOOD
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH I KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
I KNOW
YEAH
UM OKAY
OTHERWISE I AM ALSO MUCH MORE AVAILABLE THAN I WAS
I MEAN WHEN YOU CAME IT WAS JUST LIKE CRA ONE OF THE CRAZIEST UH UH TIMES OF THIS YEAR
UH UH IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT I WAS VERY PRODUCTIVE THAT I WAS DOING ANYTHING USEFUL
BUT IT JUST LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WRITING THESIS ALL THE TIME RE WRITING AND CHANGE THE DO MAKE A LITTLE CHANGES AND UH UH AND
YEAH HE'S VER NO HE HAS MANY MORE SP MANY MORE PEOPLE SO TO TAKE CARE OF
YEAH
WELL I'M TYPICALLY I TRY TO BE BECAUSE UH BECAUSE YOU KNOW I MEAN FOR S THIS IS ALSO MY LIVELIHOOD RIGHT STUDENTS
SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT UH THEY NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING THAT UH SO FEEL FREE BASICALLY TO STOP BY ANY TIME AND UM YEAH AND UH IT'S NOT THAT I KNOW EVERYTHING
BUT
IF I KNOW I UH I THINK I SORT OF KNOW A LITTLE BIT LIKE WHAT YOU GUYS WERE DOI UH DOING RIGHT
BUT NOT UH NOT OBVI EVERY DETAIL OBVIOUSLY
YEAH
WHAT YEAH YOU DON'T KNOW WHY WHY YOU ARE DOING IT ANYMORE
YEAH
OH BOY
YEAH
OOPS
OKAY I THINK MY MIC IS FALLING FALLING
SO I THINK WE GO HUH
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANKS A LOT
YEP
S SO JOEL IS GOING TO TALK
THAT'S MINE
WELL MAY FROM DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW
BUT
YEAH
RIGHT
LET ME JUST TELL US SO WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY ABOUT UH I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR YOU ARE WITH THE S FEATURES
OR
SO YOU KNOW S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
BUT T WHAT CHRISTOS WAS DOING
RIGHT
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
WHAT YEAH YEAH
WE SHOULDN'T SMILE
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH BUT I'M USING THAT FOR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT REASON RIGHT
SO IT'S UH SPEECH CODING
SO UH WHAT IS THE TASK IS USUAL JUST TAKE THE SPEECH OF COURSE SOMEHOW TO ENCODE IT INTO AS AS SMALL NUMBER OF BEAT AS POSSIBLE AND WITH A REASONABLE QUALITY OF COURSE
AND AGAIN TO E UH DECODE IT
AND I'M USING F. D. L. P. FOR THAT STILL PLAYING WITH UH MORE LESS ONE SECOND LONG SEGMENTS
SO JUST DIVIDING THE SPEECH INTO ONE S ONE SECOND FRAMES DOING D. C. T.
IT'S JUST THE STANDARD WOR OF WORK
AND THEN DOING SOME COMPRESSION AND COMPUTATION OF YEAH YEAH YEAH SH OH YEAH
BUT YOU ARE DOING THE SAME NO
YEAH B YEAH YEAH YOU TAKE THE THE D. C. T. AND YOU JUST DIVIDE IT INTO SEVERAL SUB BANDS FREQUENCY BANDS WITH A DIFFERENT UH
I D I DO
YOU MEAN
NO NO NO
NO
I DON'T DO
YEAH JUST ONE SECOND WITH WITHOUT OVERLAPPING
BUT IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN THERE IS A OVERLAP
BECAUSE YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH FILTERS YOU WANT MORE LESS OR JUST TRAJECTORIES OF THOSE BANDS
SO THERE IS OVERLAPPING
I'M USING THOSE GAUSSIAN FILTERS OR CLASSICAL THOSE THOSE TRAPET TRAPEZOIDAL LIKE IN UH M. F. C. C. S RIGHT
AND THEN PROCESSING EACH F YEAH P. L. P. S
OKAY TR TRIANGULARS
THAT ONE
THEN I'M DOING S DOING UH INDEPENDENT PROCESSING OF EACH FREQUENCY BAND
SO I'M COMPUTING THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE WHICH IS JUST THE ENVELOPE OF SOME TEMPORAL TRAJECTORY
AND MORE OR LESS YOU CAN DIVIDE THIS INTO A HILBERT ENVELOPE HILB HILBERT CARRIER
WE USE SOMETHING LIKE L. P. A LINEAR PREDICTION ENVELOPE
AUTO REGRESSIVE MODEL AND EXCITATION SIGNAL
YEAH SO THOSE ARE TWO PARTS OR ITEMS YOU NEED SOMEHOW TO ENCODE IF YOU WANT AGAIN TO GET ORIGINAL SPEECH OR REASONABLE QUALITY
AND YEAH THERE IS SOME COMPRESSION FACTOR WHICH IS AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE COMPUTING THAT AUTO REGRESSIVE MODEL FROM F. D. L. P.
YOU CAN COMPRESS THE SPECTRUM SOMEHOW IN IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU RATHER UM PRESERVE THOSE EVEN ALSO THOSE DIPS NOT ONLY PEAKS IN THE SPECTRUM
AND IT SOUNDS BETTER FOR SOME KIND OF SPEECH SIGNALS
SO IT'S KIND OF LOGARITHM WHEN YOU USE LOGARITHM FOR M. F. C. C. S RIGHT
SO IT'S AGAIN COMPRESSION FACTOR SOMETHING LIKE TH AND BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO UNCOMPRESS IT AGAIN OF COURSE TO GET BACK THE SPEECH
AND THERE OTHER OTHER THINGS WHICH I'M DOING
BUT IT'S NOT RELATED TO SPEECH RECOGNITION SO MUCH OR BUT
WELL
RIGHT RIGHT
WELL IT'S YEAH
SURE SURE I KNOW
I MEAN IT'S MORE OR LESS THE SAME APPROACH RIGHT
THERE IS M UH JUST MORE RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
WITH WHAT
YEAH YEAH
SURE
NUMBER OF BANDS AND
YOU KNOW THAT'S THE PROBLEM FOR SPEECH CODING
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE RESULTS LIKE IN SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO OF COURSE I HAVE TO LISTEN IT AND AND S WELL SO NOW WHAT I'M USING ARE FIFTEEN BANDS
WHICH SEEMS TO ME FIT FIFTEEN FREQUENCY BAND WHICH SEEMS TO ME QUITE REASONABLE
WE CAN GO DOWN TILL LIKE TWELVE AND STILL OKAY I WOULD SAY
BUT THEN YOU START HEARING DIFFERENCE
OR ALSO THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM
ONCE YOU CAN GO DOWN WITH FREQUENCY BANDS THEN YOU WILL HAVE MUCH UH MORE C UH COMPLICATED DATA
UH LET'S SAY EXCITATION SIGNAL OR THAT CARRIER WHICH YEAH BECAUSE BROAD BANDS RIGHT
YEAH MAYBE LIKE THAT
NO
SO THERE IS MORE AND MORE S UH FREQUENCY COMPONENTS LET'S SAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN ONE BROAD BAND
SO
NO
L. P. C. WILL MAYBE
BUT THEN YOU HAVE STILL ANOTHER PART SOMETIME SOMETHING LIKE A SOURCE AND A FILTER
SO WHEN YOU ARE DOING SPEECH CODING OR
YEAH
WHY
I DON'T KNOW NOW
IT'S QUITE LONG
WELL I MEAN IT'S IT'S THE SAME LIKE WHEN YOU ARE DOING L. P. L. P. SYNTHESIS RIGHT
SO YOU'VE GOT SOURCE SIGNAL
I DON'T KNOW
SOURCE
UH
YEAH
AND THEN THERE IS SOME FILTER WHICH IS THAT ONE DIVIDED BY A. Z.
AND THAT'S AND THAT'S IT
AND THE SOURCE CAN BE A NOISE SIGNAL OR IT CAN BE SOME UH SEQUENCE OF UH WHAT IS THAT
PULSES RIGHT
THIS IS YEAH
SO AND IT'S MORE LESS OR LESS THE SAME WHAT I'M DOING
SO THIS IS SOME ENVELOPE WHICH IS IN OUR CASE RELATED TO HILBERT ENVELOPE
AND THIS IS A SOURCE SIGNAL WHICH IS HILBERT CARRIER
RIGHT
RIGHT
EXACTLY
YEAH
SO THIS IS NOW GOING TO BE FREQUENCY
YEAH
SO MORE OR LESS IF WE UH CAN WE CAN PLOT IT
SO WHAT WE CAN SEE IS SOME HILBERT ENVELOPE LIKE THIS
AND THEN THERE IS THAT HILBERT CARRIER
OR THIS NOT HILBERT CARRIER
BUT THIS IS THE SIGNAL WHICH WE GET FROM ONE DI ONE FREQUENCY BAND
SO YOU COMPUTE D. C. T. RIGHT FROM SIGNAL
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY
AND WHAT WE GET FROM THAT IS THIS HILBERT ENVELOPE RIGHT
AND THE SECOND WHICH SHOULD BE THAT CARRIER SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
IT'S JUST REALLY CLOSE TO COSINE WE M WE MIGHT SEE IF WE DO IT DO IT PROPERLY RIGHT
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU ALSO HAVE TO SOMEHOW TRANSMIT OR AT LEAST TRY TO TRANSMIT IN ORDER TO GET
RIGHT RIGHT
RIGHT
NO I DON'T NEED L. P. C.
NO NO
THIS IS A RESIDUAL FOR ME
YEAH I'M JUST WAN I JUST WANT TO TRANSMIT THIS SIGNAL RIGHT
IT'S AND WHAT YOU NEED IS THIS ENVELOPE AND THIS ONE CARRIER
AND YOU AGAIN GET THE SAME SIGNAL THIS THIS THIS SHAPE DOING I. D. C. T.
PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
RIGHT
BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK FOR EXAMPLE FOR A S IF YOU HAVE A VERY G GOOD MUSIC SIGNAL
WHICH IS VERY UH PERIODIC YOU CAN REALLY SEE SOMETHING LIKE THERE IS ONE PEAK AND
AND FREQUENCY MORE OR LESS DOESN'T CHANGE
IT'S UH RELATED TO UH THAT FREQUENCY OF THE BROAD BAND OR HOW IT'S CALLED
IF YOU ADD THOSE FILTERS WHICH ARE UH WIDER AND WIDER THIS IS THAT CENTRE FREQUENCY WHICH IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO THIS ONE
SO THEN YOU CAN TRANSMIT UH JUST FE
IT'S WORSE AND WORSE
DON'T THEN YOU DON'T SEE ANY ANYTHING LIKE COSINE
BUT
RIGHT RIGHT
EVERYWHERE
IT SOUNDS LIKE L. P. C. WHEN YOU EXCITED BY NOISE
IT'S BETTER I WOULD SAY
UH BETTER QUALITY
DEFINITELY BETTER QUALITY
IT LOWER BIT RATE
BUT THAT'S A PROBLEM
SO SO
YEAH SURE
OBJECTIVE MEASURE WELL IT WAS SOME THOSE UH DISTANCES SPECTRAL DISTANCES WELL EDINBURGH SAW PROBABLY
SO WELL I MEAN
I H
ALRIGHT
YEAH
SURE
I SEE
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
ALSO THERE ARE PAPERS ABOUT IT THAT F IF YOU HAVE LIKE TWELVE FREQUENCY BANDS IT'S SOMEHOW OPTIMAL
COMPRESSION IS ONLY TO REALLY TO SOMEHOW FEED THAT UH HILBERT ENVELOPE TO YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YOU CAN MODEL IT BETTER
THERE IS NO ECHO OR SOMETHING LIKE REVE REVERBERANCE IN THE SIGNAL IF YOU REALLY GO DOWN WITH THAT COMPRESSION FACTOR TO LIKE ZERO POINT ONE SOMETHING THAT
ZERO POINT ONE
SO
RIGHT
IT'S IT'S S RIGHT
AND IT'S STILL YEAH
YEAH YOU JUST PRESERVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT LITTLE BIT
LET'S SAY IN R. S. S.
YEAH
I THINK HYNEK HAS GOT MA MANY PAPERS OR SOME PAPERS OVER THAT
SO OH
IN I THINK I READ IT
RIGHT MORE OR LESS
RIGHT
EXACTLY
YEAH
WELL I THINK YOU CAN REALLY TAKE THOSE PAPERS FROM UH MARIUS ABOUT F. D. L. P.
THEY ARE THAT'S REALLY ENOUGH ON
WHAT IS SAPA
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
JUST SOMETHING
RIGHT
APPROACHES
MM-HMM
BUT THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS FROM IDIAP I THINK
AT LEAST TWO REPORTS FROM MARIUS SEEM TO ME
YEAH THEY ARE MORE LESS THEY ARE SAME LIKE
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH DEFINITELY
SOMETIMES UNREADABLE I WOULD SAY
IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT BUT YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK THIS YEAR A LOT UH INTERSPEECH THERE WAS ONE PAPER
BUT IT WAS REGARDED TO SPEECH RECOGNITION SOMEHOW
Y YEAH YEAH
IT WAS NOT SOMETHING LIKE SPEECH CODING OR THAT D. C. T. TRANSFORMS
N NOTHING LIKE THAT
SO
RIGHT
RIGHT
MM
MAYBE YES
MAYBE NO
I DON'T IT'S HARD TO SAY
NOW IT'S NOT SO BAD WITH THAT IF YOU REALLY WRITE IT F WELL
AND HE DID
I THINK SO
SURE
R RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WHATEVER
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT
UH
OH YEAH
SURE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS CASE
BUT STILL
RIGHT
YEAH AND DEFINITE
NOVEMBER
NOVEMBER
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO T TALK OR TO TEACH
IT'S JUST THAT PERCEPTUAL STUFF AND
MM-HMM
DO YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU HAVE
NO
OH IT'S GRADUATE FOR GRADUATES
WELL I THINK GUILLERMO WAS THINKING ABOUT
AND
HMM
WELL I WOULD LIKE TO GO THERE BUT NOT JUST FOR CREDITS
JUST MAYBE TO HEAR SOMETHING NEW
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
OH SURE
A ANY
I THINK SO
WHY YOU ARE YOU DOING THIS
GOOD QUESTION SOMETIME ASKING
RIGHT
THANK YOU
NO I'M GOING TO LISTEN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
SPEECH CODING
NO
YEAH
YEAH WELL THAT'S UH YEAH
SO
UH WELL UH SO BASICALLY I STARTED READING ABOUT THE FEATURES THAT'S TAKING THE LONG TEMPORAL AND UH TIME FRAME THAT'S UH TRAPS
AND UH TANDEM APPROACH
YEAH S YEAH YEAH
SO THEN I ALSO STARTED WITH THE THERE WAS A PAPER ON UH FITTING A EAR MODEL TO THE D. C. T. OF A SIGNAL
STARTED WITH THAT AND SLOWLY GETTING USED TO THE STUFF
S
YEAH
UH I THINK YEAH YEAH
IT'S UH THE PAPER BY DAN ELLIS AND CO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
A. S. R. U.
TWO THOUSAND FOUR I GUESS YEAH
TWO THOUSAND THREE YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
SO FOR
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO THEN I CONTINUED WITH UH ANOTHER UH PAPER THAT YOU ARE MENTIONING L. P. TRAP
SO I JUST MOVING AROUND WITH THAT IDEAS
AND ALSO UH THE MAIN IDEA TODAY WHY I TOLD MAYBE IS LIKE IF YOU CAN LIST DOWN WHAT ALL THINGS ARE THERE TO BE TAKEN CARE OF
THEN ONE BY ONE
BECAUSE FINALLY FACE FIND I DO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
SO UH MAYBE TO LIST DOWN THE THINGS OTHER THAN THE WHAT I'VE ALREADY TAKEN FROM YOU
AND ALSO TO DISCUSS GENERALLY
YEAH
YEAH
FEATURE EXTRACTION
PART TANDEM TRAINING
'KAY
SO YEAH RIGHT NOW I HAVE THE FEATURE EXTRACTION PART WHERE I CAN GET THE PHONEME POSTERIORS AND THROUGH THE NEURAL NET
SO THEN I THINK I NEED YEAH
YEAH I YEAH BUT UH YEAH IT'S T. K. THROUGH FOR SOME OTHER TASK I'VE RUN IT'S T. K.
SO I HAVE THE GENERAL FEEL
BUT UH MAYBE I CAN TAKE THE INTERCEPTOR FROM YOU AND RUN IT ONCE ON MY TO HAVE IT
YEAH
SO
YEAH
BASICALLY
SO THEN I CAN CAN SHARE WHAT I CA HAVE READ AND UH
YEAH
YES
SO I'LL USE THIS
YEAH THE
LET'S DO THE FEATURE EXTRACTION THAT WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THEN THE BACK END FOR THAT
THEN
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UH SO YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
TRAPS I KNOW
BUT THOUGH WITH VARIOUS
OKAY
LENGTH
AH
OKAY
FRAME
OKAY
FILTERING YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
IT'S ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RI
YEAH
SO COMPRESSION BASICALLY YOU ARE LOOKING AT I GUESS YEAH
MM-HMM
CODING
YEAH
OKAY
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OKAY
UH-HUH
OKAY
MM-HMM
NO THAT'S FOR COMPRESSION
I DON'T NEED FOR FOR COMPRESSION YOU BASICALLY DON'T NEED THE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND P. L. P.
TRIANGLE
UH YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
THE SPEECH SIGNAL YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE
YEAH USE MAYBE YOU CAN USE THE BOARD FOR THAT YEAH
CAN WE REMOVE THIS WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO THIS PLACE
OH
PERIODIC PULSE YEAH
BUT THIS IS UH
YEAH
THIS IS LIKE A RESIDUAL FOR HIM
YEAH IN THE FOR UH FREQUENCY IT IS
FOR ANY OBJECT YOU MEASURE YOU USE FOR UH A RECONSTRUCTED SIGNAL AND UH
UH-HUH
YEAH
H. P.
SO WHAT IS THE COMPRESSION FACTOR WE ARE GETTING HERE
UH-HUH
OKAY
YES
MM-HMM
TO FIT THE THE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
COMING BACK THOUGH
YES
YES
ENVELOPE YEAH
YEAH
UH ONE THING I WANTED TO KNOW IS ANY UM A GOOD LITERATURE ON THESE LINES
UH WHERE YOU STARTED WITH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S ONE YEAH O UH TH OH
I HAVE TWO WITH THE
INTERSPEECH PAPER I

AH
YEAH
BECAUSE S S IN I. S. IT'S FOUR UH CREDITS AND UH GUILLERMO IS TAKING I THINK HE'S G YEAH
NOTEBOOKS
MM-HMM
WHERE WAS THIS
IN OKAY
YEAH
BUT I CAN COME TO YEAH
LATER
OKAY
UH-HUH
YEAH
SO IN CASE I NEED SOMETHING ON THIS F. D. L. P. I'LL COME TO YOU
UH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
TAKES YOUR UH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YES
YEAH THANKS
OH WHAT WHAT IS THE TOPIC HERE
WELL I GUESS SO
I COULDN'T
I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE
BUT I CANNOT
WELL I THINK THAT I'M MORE NOW
MUCH MORE THAN ME
BECAUSE
OH
OKAY
YEAH
TO THE D. C. D.
OH I CANNOT SAY IT
TO THE HILBERT ENVELOPE YOU MEAN NO
YEAH YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
WHY THAT
I DON'T THINK SO
YEAH I JUST RE WROTE IN IN C. PLUS PLUS
I DIDN'T DO US SO MUCH ON THAT
WELL WE WE TRIED UH MANY KNOBS TO TUNE ON TH ON THAT
BECAUSE YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT COMPRESSION FACTOR AND EVERYTHING
SO I TRIED A LITTLE BIT LIKE UM PICK MAYBE THREE KNOBS AND TRY TO GO THROUGH THE THREE D. THREE D. CAGE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN WHICH WHICH KIND OF SETTINGS
SO THIS WE DID
BUT WE WE DIDN'T BECAUSE THERE WAS STILL A QUESTION THAT I DON'T REMEMBER RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME ESSENTIAL QUESTION
I I DON'T REMEMBER
I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT IT F AND BECAUSE BE BEFORE I WOU BEFORE I WE COULD U WE COULD WRITE ANYTHING I I WOULD BE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT SOMETHING IS RIGHT THERE
I COULDN'T BE SURE ABOUT IT AT THE TIME
SO AND ANYWAY IT IT TAKES TIME THIS THIS COMPUTATION
IT'S IT'S VERY INEFFICIENT
IT TAKES LIKE HUNDRED TIMES MORE THAN COMPUTING SOME M. F. C. C. S COMPUTING THESE FEATURES BECAUSE IT'S UH HUGE D. C. T. HUGE F. F. T. EVERYWHERE
AND
YEAH
THERE IS NO OPTIMISATION
WE JUST STICK TO THE TRAP
WE WANTED TO MAKE AS CLOSE TO TRAP AS IS POSSIBLE WHICH IS SILLY BUT THAT W YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE
YEAH
Y OKAY
SO SO WHAT WELL LAST TIME WE WE WERE S TALKING ABOUT WHAT ABOUT GAUSSIANS
YOU YOU HAVE THE GAUSSIANS RUNNING SOMEHOW
LIKE FEATURE EXTRACTION
AND THEN THE TANDEM TRAINING C ALSO SO THE YOU ARE ABLE TO TRAIN THE NET NOW
NO
NO SO THEY ARE GOING FROM ICSI
HUH
YEAH
EH
BUT WHO WHO IS THE ONE WHO WHO IS NOW DEVELOPING THE QUICKNET AND THESE THINGS
THE THE M. L. P. FOUR AND THESE THINGS
BECAUSE IT'S
IT WAS BARRY
AH I SEE
I SEE
WELL STILL WE HAVE THE EXPERTS WHO WHO MADE THE SOFTWARE ON HERE YOU KNOW
OLIVIER BORNET AND
UH QUICKNET TRAINING
YEAH
YES BUT OLIVIER MAKE IT RUN ON ON THESE MACHINES AND MAKE THE UH CROSS THE TWO G. BARRIER HERE AT IDIAP
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T WE COULDN'T DO SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT
BUT HE IS HE IS NO GOOD IN QUICKNET RIGHT I S I GUESS
YEAH
UM OKAY
SO SO
RIGHT
SO YOU JUST MISS THE BACK END WHICH IS EASY BECAUSE IT'S H. T. K. IT'S EVERYONE KNOWS HERE
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
A AND YOU YOU JUST NEED FROM US TO HEAR W WHAT ARE THE OTHER P FRONT ENDS AND OTHER FEATURES TO TO CHOOSE OR SOMETHING
OKAY SO HOW DO WE DO IT
SHOU SHOU SHOULD I LIST IT
OR
YEAH
WELL UH LIKE I I D I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FEATURE EXTRACTION AND THEN THE M. L. P.
BECAUSE SEE YOU FEED SOMETHING TO THE M. L. P. WHICH ARE NOT THE WAVES
SO SO WELL AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT
AND THEN THE BACK END
BUT OKAY
WELL SO WHAT WHAT I HAVE HERE WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SINCE I WAS HERE WAS M. F. C. C. P. L. P. WHICH IS ALWAYS NEEDED FOR COMPRESSING PURPOSES
THEN TRAPS WITH W VARIOUS LENGTHS
AND ALSO UH YOU KNOW TRAPS NOW
WITH VAR VARIOUS LENGTHS WE WERE TRYING TO TO START THEM FROM FROM ON THE ULTIMATE LENGTH OF ONE ONE UH FRAME UP TO ONE SECOND OR EVEN MORE
BUT IT WAS MM SO THIS
ALSO W THEN WE APPLY THE D. C. T. ON THE TRAP ITSELF WHICH IS SOME SOMETHING LIKE THE GAUSSIANS
APPLYING SOME FILT FILTERING
BASICALLY THE TRAP
SO THIS
BUT THIS IS MAINLY FRANTA WHO WAS DOING THIS
SO THIS IS RELATED TO TRAPS
I WAS ALSO TRYING THE WARPING
MEANS IF YOU HAVE A SECOND UM WHICH IS UH A HUNDRED AND ONE SAMPLES I WAS JUST KEEPING THE CENTRAL TEN TEN SAMPLES
AND THEN I WAS THROWING AWAY SOME SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW
LIKE WITH SAMPLING THIS THIS UH ONE SECOND OF THE TRAP TO SOMETHING WHICH I WHICH I UH PRESERVED ALL THE POINTS IN THE CENTRE AND JUST UH PICKED EVERY TENTH POINT AT THE BOUNDARIES
WHICH MEANS THE TRAP UH HUNDRED AND ONE TRAP TRAJECTORY SHRANK TO SAY FIFTEEN POINTS WITH UH WITH STILL PRESERVING THE MAXIMUM RESOLUTION AT THE CENTRE AND THROWING AWAY MOST OF THE POINTS NEAR THE BOUNDARY
SO THIS I WAS TRYING
SO THESE I HAVE SOME RESULTS ON
SO THESE ARE TRAPS
THEN THE GAUSS TRAPS
THEN TANDEM SYSTEM
UH THE TANDEM YOU PLUS MINUS HALF
BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S JUST A P. L. P. S
AND THEN THERE IS A TRAINING UH WITH M. L. P. THAT'S TAKING SOME CONTEXT OF THESE P. L. P. COEFFICIENTS
SO IT'S LIKE FEEDING THE P. L. UH P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. S W WHATEVER TO M. L. P. AND TAKING SOME CONTEXT
THIS IS THE TANDEM
SO THIS SET UP WE ALSO HAVE HERE
I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT WITH THIS
BUT MAYBE YOU SOME MORE RESULTS OH IT'S HEMANT WHO HAS THE RESULTS ON TANDEM I GUESS NO
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
BUT UH I THINK THE UH I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS ARE ALREADY IN THE THESIS HE'S WRITING
SO SO IS THERE SOME SOMEWHERE
SO THIS IS TANDEM
UH THEN UH THEN WHAT
AND THEN THERE IS THE F. D. L. P.
THEN WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT
WHICH IS WHICH I HAVE MORE EXPERIMENTS ON
ALSO THIS WARPING AND COMPRESSIONS AND ALL THESE THINGS
SO
WELL IT'S BIL STILL SUB BANDS NO
WELL YEAH
BUT THAT YOU JUST DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANY SUB BAND SO FAR
AND BY THE WAY YOU DON'T DO THE OVERLAP ON THE SUB BANDS NO
OR YOU DO
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T DO THE OVERLAP ON THE TIME DOMAIN
YOU SAID SOMETHI YEAH
OKAY SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
HMM
P. L. P. S
M. F. C. C. OR TRIANGLES
OKAY
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS COMPRESSION HOW HOW DOES IT WHY IT'S OKAY
I JUST DON'T KNOW
AH HE'S NEW
HE'S HE'S DOING YOU MOST OF THE THINGS
SO
OKAY
WELL WHAT
I WHAT
I I D YEAH
WELL THE BEGINNING OF THE
OH YEAH
SURE SURE SURE SURE
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
SO UM JUST THEY IN TH UM IN THE SPEECH UH RE SYNTHESIS OR CODING WHAT YOU'RE DOING UM DID YOU TRY TO TO PLAY WITH THE KNOBS SOMEWHERE
LIKE UH MANY UH UH V WIDTHS
I M NO NO
THE COMPRESSION NUMBER OF BANDS AND LENGTHS OF THE SO WHAT YOU WHAT YOU WERE PLAYING WITH AND WHAT OTHER RESULT
LIKE WHAT TO USE SO THAT IT SOUNDS THE BEST
YEAH O OF COURSE YOU YOU LISTEN TO IT YOURSELF
I D I'M FINE WITH THAT
BECAUSE
YEAH
OKAY
BUT
IF YOU GO DOWN
I SEE
SO SO YOU WON'T SAY THAT THE L. P. C. IS NOT ABLE TO FIT IT SO THAT THE RESIDUAL WAS EASY
WILL BE HERO
I DON'T THINK SO
NO NO NO NO
ARE NOT SUPPOSED
I THINK YOU HAVE TO PUSH IT PUSH IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT REACTS TO THE
YEAH
YEAH
OH WHICH LINES
YEAH
OKAY OKAY OKAY OKAY OKAY
MM-HMM
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
THIS IS THE SUB BAND TIME SIGNAL
IT'S
YEAH
I SEE
OKAY
SO
MM-HMM
I SEE
I WAS THINKING THE RESIDUAL IN L. P. C. FIT OF THE HILBERT ENVELOPE NOT THIS
I WAS NOT THINKING OF THIS AT ALL BEFORE YOU KNOW
'CAUSE THERE ARE THREE THINGS
FIRST YOU HAVE TO ENCODE THIS THEN THE L. P. C. COEFFICIENTS AND THE RESIDUAL AFTER L. P. C. FIT IF YOU LIKE
OH YOU DON'T
THIS IS THE RESIDUAL
YEAH
WELL I
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT THAT'S NICE
OKAY
AND SO SO SO THE SO THE BROADER BANDS DO WHAT ON THIS PICTURE
L LEFT LEFT
HMM
YEAH THAT THAT'S
YEAH
ALTHOUGH HERVE JUST SAID THAT WE SHOULDN'T S TALK ABOUT CONFIDENTIAL THINGS HERE
THAT'S THAT'S THE PROBLEM
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OH OKAY
SO SO THERE IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE THE LOWER BANDS THE THE WORSE STUFF YOU JUST SAID AND AND THE MORE BANDS THE MORE COEFFICIENTS TO TRANSMIT
SO FIFTEEN IS ABOUT OKAY
OKAY
SO THIS
AND THEN THERE IS A COMPRESSION
WHAT ABOUT THAT
SO THAT YOU GET SO THAT YOU CAN'T MODEL IT ACTUALLY
YEAH
OF WHAT
OH OH OH COMPRESSION
'KAY
THE SUB BAND SIGNAL
SUB BANDS POWER SPECTRUM
L. P. C.
L. UH L. P.
YEAH
S
WELL YEAH
YEAH YEAH
GO ON
UH
YEAH THEY ARE
ABOUT THREE PAPERS
THERE WAS UH THE S S S SAPA OR HOW IT'S CALLED THE CONFERE THEN THEN
AND ONE IS IN IN THE AMERICA UH YES
YEAH
I I DON'T KNOW
I JUST N
YOU WERE
YOU DON'T KNOW
EVALUATION THAT'S THAT'S BAD
'KAY
YEAH
ALSO I CAN UM BEFORE MARIUS LEFT HE HE HAS HE HAD ACTUALLY LEFT HIMSELF
BUT ALL THE FILES ARE HERE
YOU KNOW
SO ALL THE M MATLAB IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THESE ARE HERE
AND THERE IS ALSO ONE BIG TABLE THAT HE USED HE USED TO YEAH
HE WAS ALSO PLAYING WITH ALL THESE COMPRESSION FACTORS AND LENGTHS OF THE OF OF THAT
AND THERE IS A BIG TABLE IN IN EXCEL WHICH YOU CAN LOOK AT
YEAH YEAH YEAH
THIS WA
UH YEAH
BECAUSE IT IT IT TOOK A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME
AND HE BASICALLY HE HE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO REALISE THAT THESE THESE GUYS ARE PRETTY SLOW TO TO DO THESE THINGS
SO HE HE HE JUST UH HE JUST UH PUT HERE THE P. MAKE ENVIRONMENT AND HE DIDN'T STICK TO ANY CLUSTER OR ANYTHING
HE JUST PUT P. MAKE AND RUN IT ON UH ON ALL THE MACHINES HERE
SO AT SOME POINT HE WAS USING ALL THE AVAILABLE MEMORY BY ANY MISTAKE YOU KNOW
SO AT TH IN THE MORNING ALL THE MACHINES WERE WERE JUST STUCK
D NO ONE COULD EVER M MOVE THE MOUSE
SO THESE THESE RESUL YEAH
BECAUSE HE WAS DOING EVERYTHING IN MATLAB
SO IT WAS AGAIN TEN TIMES MORE DEMANDING THAN C. PLUS PLUS AND THEN
MM
BUT HE DID
HE WROTE IT WELL
BUT ANYWAY ANYWAY
BECAUSE I W I IN THE CODE THAT I WROTE I WAS LIKE PLAYING ALSO WITH IF IF THE MAT MATRIX IS PARSE I REALLY DON'T USE IT ALL
I JUST MULTIPLY FROM HERE TO HERE FROM HERE TO HERE
NOT TO MATRIX P MY MATRIX
AND THEN I I JUST OPTIMISED IT A BIT
AND ALSO BLAST LIBRARIES AND ALL THESE STA THINGS
BUT OKAY
OH WELL WHATEVER
BUT THE T
UH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THERE IS A THE BACK END RECOGNIZER WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU WHICH IS TURN AROUND OF EIGHTEEN MINUTES OR WELL FROM ELEVEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES
NORMALLY IT WOULD TAKE HOUR AND A HALF
YEAH NO
NO TODAY IT WAS OVER ONE HOUR
IT'S JUST LIKE TEN TIMES LESS MAYBE OR FIVE TO TEN TIMES LESS
BUT STILL STILL YOU CAN YOU CAN FIVE TIMES MORE COMPUTE
GREAT
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THESE
I I DON'T KNOW
I I DIDN'T TRY TO
I DIDN'T EVEN MAIL TO TO CHERNOTSKY I MUST SAY
UH I JUST TALKED TO ONE GIRL THERE WHICH TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD BE POSSIBLY ABLE TO FIND ME A JOB THERE
ANY ANY JOB LIKE RELATED MAYBE TO FIELD
BUT JOB
NOT NOT ANYTHING ANY RESEARCH
SO IF IF NOTHING THEN THEN I COULD BE ABLE TO GET THE JOB SOMEWHERE
YEAH PROBABLY
YEAH BUT T S BUT YEAH
'KAY
WE HOPE THAT YOU FIND OUT THAT EVERYTHING WAS WRONG AND THAT THE POTENTIAL IS MUCH BIGGER
YEAH IT ACTUALLY WORK THAT TOO
NO
BUT AFTER YOU FIND OUT THE BACK THEN IT WILL BE THAT WILL BE THE YEAH
SO WE WILL SEND YOU THE PAPERS RELATED
AND I WILL POINT YOU TO ALL THE CODE WHICH I HAVE
AND YES
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH I CAN PLAY IT BACK
SO I CAN JUST NOW TELL THE THE LOCATIONS OF ALL THE FILES AND YOU CAN REWIND
YEAH YEAH FERRET
UM SO
ANY ANY MORE THINGS
YEAH UNTIL TWENTY FOUR
IT'S THE FRIDAY
SO NOVEMBER YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
IT WAS YEAH THE LAST TIME IT WAS FOR ME IT WAS GOOD THE COURSE FROM MY FROM ONE SPECIAL REASON
BECAUSE IN THE F WHEN THERE TH WERE THE FLATS IN I LOST ALL MY PAPERS FROM MY SCHOOL
ALL THE ALL THE EXERCISE BOOKS
UM HOW TO SAY THIS
NOTE NOTE YEAH ALL THE NOTEPADS AND EVERYTHING ALL THE NOTES FROM ANY COURSES
SO I WAS REMEMBERING WHAT I WAS LEARNED OR WHAT I WAS TAUGHT AT THE TIME
SO SO I HAVE IT NOW BACK AT LEAST PARTIALLY
'CAUSE ALL THE ALL THE ALGORITHMS YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT
YEAH
UH UH I WOULD ADD
YEAH
NOW
MM-HMM
MM
OH
SOME
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND ALSO IN THE IN THE L LAB LABS THE D PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THEY JUST FOLLOW THE PAPERS
IT WAS
YEAH
UH
NOT TO THIS TOPIC
YEAH BUT ANYWAY AFTER I'M BACK I'LL BE STILL ON SKYPE AND ALL THESE THINGS
SO NO PROBLEM TO CONTACT ME UNTIL I DON'T KNOW MAY NEXT YEAR
SO IT'S FINE
WELL I WOULD LIKE TO YEAH
I SHOULD
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO STUDY HERE FOR THAT THAT LONG TIME NO
I TH
TWO TWO YEARS YEAH
AND I WOULD HAVE TO STAY ONE MORE
UH WELL IT WOULD BE GOOD REASON FOR PETRA THAT I HAVE TO STAY HERE
YEAH YEAH
BECAUSE SHE HAS A GOOD POSITION BECAUSE SHE HAS A FRIEND WHICH IS STARTING WHO IS STARTING A LAB THERE
AND EVERYTHING IS IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR HER AT LEAST
BUT THE PROBLEM IS AND THEN SHE WILL GO BACK AND THERE'S UH F FAMILY ISSUES AND ALL THESE THINGS YOU KNOW
FOR A GIRL IT'S ALWAYS THE PAIN
BECAUSE SHE HAS TO BREAK FOR SOME TIME AT LEAST A LITTLE
BUT HAS TO BREAK
AND IN IN THE SCIENCE IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO TO BREAK
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
BUT
YEAH BUT I THINK DEFINITELY YOU ARE THE BEST PERSON HERE TO WITH UH RELATED TO AVAILABILITY OF YOU
BECAUSE IF IF IF I WANT TO GO TO HERVE I PROBABLY CALL SECRETARY
HE'S THERE OR AND WHEN I CAN AND I THERE WAS NO OP UH NO EV EVERY TIME I CAME TO YOU YOU WERE AVAILABLE
AT LEAST IT
THAT'S GREAT
YOU KNOW THE CORE WHICH WE DON'T REMEMBER ANYMORE PROGRAMMING
WE KNOW THE DETAILS AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS TH WHAT IS THE GLOBAL STUFF
UH ASK HYNEK
ASK MY BOSS
YEAH
YEAH
OH
OKAY
OKAY UH FOR FOR UH THE NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE PROJECT UM WE DECIDED TO UM TO TAKE THE NOISE UH AS INPUT
AND UH GIVE A FEEDBACK UH WITH LEDS ON THE TABLE
SO THIS IS UH ONE OF THE THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WERE OFFERED TO US
BUT UH WE DECIDED TO DO TO DO UH IT THIS WAY
YES THE THE FIRST UH THE FIRST IDEA OF THE PROJECT UH WAS TO HAVE UM THE WHOLE TABLE COVERED BY LEDS
BUT UH FOR THE PROTOTYPE OF THIS ISN'T THIS IS NOT THE THE WAY WE IMPLEMENT IT NOW
BUT UH IN FACT WE HAVE A THERE WAS TH YES
TH THERE WAS THE THE RESTRICTION THAT IF WE COVER THE LE THE TABLE WITH LEDS UH SOME WON'T BE VISIBLE BECAUSE UH YOU HAVE UH YES
SO UM IF THERE IS INFORMATION DISPLAYED UNDER THE THE SHEETS UH THE IT WON'T BE UM VERY USEFUL
SO WE DECIDED TO HAVE IT UH YES THIRTY CENTIMETRE UH AT EACH SIDE
WEEKS
THIS IS FOR PRAC PRACTICAL REASON AND UH ALSO A MATTER OF TIME
BECAUSE UH
YES
BUT UH TH THERE ARE O OTHER PROBLEMS LIKE UM YES THE THE INFORMATION DISPLAY ON THE SHEETS
SO WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
YES
TRUE
AND THERE IS UH A LOT OF PROGRAMMES NOW ABOUT THIS IMPLEMENTATION
IS IT'S NOT UH IT'S NOT OBVIOUS
HMM
STILL IN PROGRESS
ALMOST DONE
MM-HMM
YES
MM YES
YES
UH
I HAVE ONE OR OR TWO QUESTION
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TO BEGIN WITH THE THE EXPLANATION ABOUT THE THE RELEASE
O OKAY
SO UM I HAVE ACTUALLY TWO QUESTIONS THAT ARE UH JUST PRACTICAL QUESTION ABO ABOUT MY UM MY IMPLEMENTATION NOW
UH I
NO
SO AND THE FIRST INFORMATION IS UM ABOUT THE THE NOISE LEVEL
N NOT THE NOISE LEVEL THE SOUND LEVEL
UH BECAUSE UH WHAT YOU GET FROM FROM THE MICROPHONES IS UH A CURVE
AND UM A WAY THE WAY UH IT IS IMPLEMENTED NOW UH TO DETECT YES
YOU HAVE A UH I HAVE PACKETS UH FOR UH LET'S SAY UH THIS IS UH THIS IS UH NOT UH FIXED
BUT UH I HAVE PACKETS FOR ABOUT UM UH ALPHA SECOND
SO IT'S UH SECOND
AND UH ON THESE PACKETS I WANT TO KNOW THE THE SOUND LEVEL THE AVERAGE SOUND LEVEL
SO UH THE WAY I DO IT NOW IS UH TO TO TAKE UH EACH TOP OF THE CURVES' BOTTOMS AND UH JUST MAKING LEVERAGE THIS
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY UM THE BEST WAY TO DO IT
BUT I DON'T KNOW UH IF
YES
OKAY
SO THIS IS THIS THE THE FIRST QUESTION
YES
BUT I THINK UH THIS IS TWO DIFFERENT PROBLEMS
UH THE FILTERING MUST BE MUST BE DONE BEFORE
AND AFTER THAT UH IF YOU HAVE UH A CLEANED CURVE AND YOU CAN UH JUST APPLY UH FUNCTIONALLY
AND UH THE SECOND QUESTION WAS ABOUT UM UH FILTERING AND UH F. F. T. YEAH WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM IT
UH
GENERAL QUESTIONS
OKAY
MM-HMM
UH O YES I WILL JUST ADD SOMETHING
UM
IS THERE A WAY TO UH TO FROM ONE UH FROM ONE STREAM TO UH TO BUILD TWO STREAMS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE THE VOICE OF ONE PEOPLE AND THE VOICE OF THE SECOND
THE
YES
NO
AND IT IT THIS IS NOT UH
A SOUND QUESTION
SOUND RELATED QUESTION
LINE IN
UH YES
THE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE THE EXTENSION AND IS UH OF THE
NO NO NO
UH OKAY
AND THE FIRE WIRE PORT
AND THERE IS AN EXTENSION FOR THIS THIS UH THIS DEVICE CONNECTED TO IT UH WITH UH OPTIC FIBRE
YES
UH YES
BE BECAUSE FOR NOW UH I'M JUST SAMPLING THE SOUND THAT UH EIGHT THOUSAND
SO UH JUST UH SOMETHING VERY VERY REL I COULD UH EVEN UH GO TO LOWER
BUT UH THIS IS JUST TO GET THE THE S THE NOISE THE SOUND LEVEL
BUT UH IF I WANT TO RECORD THE CONVERSATION WITH UH UH A PROCESSING AFTER TH
YES TO TO HAVE A BETTER SOUND QUALITY
UH PERHAPS IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A X. ARRAY YEAH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YES
OKAY
MM-HMM
SURE SURE
BUT UH WHAT IS THE THE GAIN
IN TERMS OF UH POSITION
UH UH UH CENTIMETRES OR UH MORE
OKAY
M UH WHAT YOU GET IS UH THE REAL POSITION OR UH JUST UH THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE THE SOUND COMES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YES SURE
YES
UH BECAUSE UH THERE THERE IS JUST UM FOUR MICROPHONES THAT ARE EIGHT
OKAY YES
OKAY BUT THERE ARE IN UH IN A PLAN
OKAY
BECAUSE UH AT AT T. P. F. N. THERE IS A LAB THAT IS UH HAS DONE ALMOST THE SAME THING
BUT THEY HAVE UH EIGHT MICROPHONE THAT ARE UH AT UH YES THE EIGHT UM THE EIGHT UH UH COR CORNER OF UH A CUBE YES
THE ELEVATION NO
BUT UH WHAT IS COULD BE RELEVANT IT'S NOT UH ALMOST IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE WITH THE THE UM
YES THE THE POSITION THE THE RADIUS OF THE
YES IT COULD BE
YES OKAY
YES
BECAUSE UM BECAUSE I THE UM THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE THE MICROPHONE IS TOO UH IS TOO LOW TO
MM-HMM
YES SURE
YES BUT I THINK THE THE MOST RELEVANT PART IS THE UM THE OTHER UH THE HARDWARE THAT SYNCHRONIZE THE MICROPHONES AND THAT
YES
YES
MM NOT MAXIMUM
THE THE AVERAGE ON THE ON THE PACKETS
UH YES THE THE I TAKE THE THE B I G WHEN I GO UP TO THE THE CURVE UH I'M UH ON THE AT THE LOCAL MAXIMUM
I TAKE IT
THEN THE NEXT UH LOCAL MINIMUM AND UH TAKING THIS UH THIS RANGE DOING AVERAGE ON IT
YES
DIFFERENCE
DIFFERENCE IS UH IS THAT IF I JUST UH
MM YES
YES
OKAY
A YOU HAVE UH YOU HAVE FIFTEEN IMPLEMENTATIONS
UH
YES
OKAY
SIXTEEN
SURE
OKAY OKAY
YES AND THEN I JUST UH BECAUSE UH WE ARE USING UM UH AN OPEN S AN OPEN SOURCE FRAMEWORK TO DO THIS
THERE IS UH SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW I KNOW IT UH CALLS SPHINX THAT IS DOING UH S SORRY
YES
DOING UM VOICE RECOGNITION
AND UH I JUST USE IT FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE MICROPHONE AND THE ACQUISITION
SO UH THERE IS UH ALREADY UH AN F. F. T. UH MODULE IMPLEMENTED IN IT
I DIDN'T TEST IT
BUT UM
YES SURE
Y YES FOR THE FOR THE THE POSITION
ALSO FOR DETECTION
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
'KAY YES
SURE
OKAY
YES
NO
YES
OKAY
Y YOU HAVE TO DETECT UH AN EVENT ON ONE MICROPHONE AND UH KNOW WHEN IT'S HAPPENED ON UH ON THE OTHER ONE
NO
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT'S RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF MICROPHONES AROUND
NO
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY THIS IS A MEASURE OF THE ACTIVITY O OKAY
TH THERE THERE IS A DISTANCE
BUT IT'S NOT VERY UH VERY EFFECTIVE
AS AS YOU MENTIONED
IT'S
AND UH FROM FROM THIS KIND OF IF INFORMATION YOU CAN UH LET'S SAY HAVE UH A FINGER PRINT OF THE USER TO KNOW UH IF THIS IS THE SAME USER SPEAKING
SO
NOT SURE
BECAUSE THE THE UM
OKAY
WHICH
RANGE
YES OKAY
SO
THIS IS THIS IS A BIT ARBITRARY
BECAUSE UH PERHAPS UH PERSON TWO WILL HAVE UH SOME FREQUENCIES IN THE RANGE OF
OKAY
AND IF YOU RECONSTRUCT THE STREAM FROM THIS UH THIS RANGE YOU WILL UH GET SOMETHING UH THAT IS UH
OKAY
MM-HMM
AND YOU CAN YOU CAN UM THIS WAY YOU CAN FILTER UH PERHAPS SOME RANGE THAT ARE UH JUST VERY LOW FREQUENCIES FOR UH PERHAPS UH A NOISE OR
THE YES THE FAN
OKAY
YES BUT BUT THEN THIS THIS IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE UH THIS WAY YOU CAN DETECT UH IF SOMEONE IS TALKING
IF SOMEONE UH HAS AN UH SOME NOISE WITH UH PERHAPS PUTTING HIS UH HIS CAP ON THE ON THE TABLE
PERHAPS IF THERE IS A LAPTOP AND UH IN ONE POSITION
AND YOU CAN CLASSIF UH CLASSIFY
AND THIS IS
YES
SHE' VERY GOOD
OKAY
YES
YES
AND THE THE LENGTH OF THE TIME FRAME HAS UM AN INFERENCE OF UH ON UH WHICH PARAMETERS
OKAY
TH THERE I UH LET'S SAY IF YOU USE A ONE SECOND WINDOW
UH THE IN FACT THE THE FRAME LENGTHS WILL BE UH VERY UH VERY UH I
YES
OKAY
THEY THEY WON'T BE VISIBLE ON THE ON THE WAVEFO OKAY
YES
BUT THE THE THE THE LONG UH THE LONGEST FRAME YOU WOULD USE WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED
AT MOST OKAY
OKAY YES
'KAY SO YOU CAN YEAH
OKAY
ENTER UH WHEN USER IS
UH YES
AND BEFORE I FORG FORGET IT UH I HAVE ONE QUESTION
UH YOU SAY YOU DO THE PROCESSING AFTER UH AFTERWARDS
AND UH WHAT IS THE THE COST YES THE THE LENGTH
ONE ONE OR UH BIT LONGER
OKAY
YES BUT MATLAB IS VERY UH VERY EFFECTIVE FOR UH MATRICES AND UH
OKAY
YES
OKAY
YES
RELATIVE YES
MM
YES
AND EVEN IF YOU USE UH FOUR MICROPHONES TO GET UH NOT GOOD
OKAY
OKAY
AND EIGHT IS UH IS GOOD
THERE I YES
BUT UH
YEAH
YES ONE TWO DEGREE IS VERY VERY SMALL FOR UH FOR OUR APPLICATION
BECAUSE WE WANT WE REALLY WANT TO DETECT UH IF TH THIS IS THE SAME PERSON THAT IS SPEAKING OR NOT
IF THERE IS UH AN ERROR OF UH LET'S SAY UH TEN FIFTEEN DEGREES AND BUT UH IT IS UM CAPABLE OF UH SEEING IT AS TWO DIFFERENT PERSON
THERE IS NOT PROBLEMS WITH THE
OKAY AND THE NUMBER OF SECTORS IS UH IS NOT DEPENDENT OF UH THE NUMBER OF MICROPHONES
OKAY
IF THERE IS UH TWO TWO PERSON THE SAME SECTOR I SEE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO
GEOMETRY IS NOT
WE HAVE NOT UH THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT
YES
F. F. T.
BUT TH UH UH I THINK WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE IS THE SYNCHRONIZATION OF THE MICROPHONES
RIGHT
OKAY UM UH I'M SPEAKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE UH WE WANTED UH TO DO THIS TABLE IN UH A MID TECH WAY LET'S SAY A CHEAP WAY
TO HAVE NOT UH VERY EXPENSIVE TABLES
SO I DON'T KNOW IF UM UH WHAT I'VE SEEN W ON OUR WEBSITE WAS UH THAT THE THIS INSTALLATION WAS UH A BIT EXPENSIVE
UH BUT I'M TRYING TO UH TO TO TO SEE WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND UH WHAT IS NOT UH FOR
YES
SURE
YES SH I THINK YOU HAVE TO UH TO UH
IT SH
THESE ARE THESE ARE UM SOME KINDS OF UH AND THIS ONE
YES
OKAY
EXPENSIVE
BECAUSE BECAUSE UH OF THE QUALITY OF THE THE
AND THEY ARE PLUG IN THE ON THE X. L. R.
OR UH
YES
OKAY FOR THE OUR WE'LL WE WE'LL UH
MM-HMM
LET'S HAVE A BREAK
NO
I DON'T UH
WELL I GUESS IT'S JUST A RESTRICTION WE TOOK
SO SO WE DON'T UH THE M AMOUNT OF MONEY WE HAVE TO SPEND
OTHERWISE WE COULD HAVE UH WE COULD IMAGINE TO HAVE A WHOLE TABLE OF OF UH S WELL OF L. E. D. S
AND THEN Y YOU CAN REALLY START TO TO SOME REGIONS OF THE TABLE
SO YEAH
OH LET'S
DOES
YEAH I CAN JUST EXPLAIN MY PROJECT
IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE
WELL IT'S ALSO ABOUT TABLES BUT THE IDEA IS IF UH UH THE SEVERAL STUDENTS COME TO A TABLE WITH THEIR LAPTOPS
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO SHARE INFORMATION EASILY
AND UH IN FACT W WHAT WE WE ARE DOING NOW WE PROJECT UM ANOTHER SCREEN ON ON THE TABLE
AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE ABLE TO USE THEIR THEIR MOUSE OF THEIR LAPTOP TO GO TO THE TO THE PROJECT SCREEN THERE AND UH THE PROJECT SCREEN IS JUST ANOTHER WINDOWS MACHINE THAT IS RUNNING
SO YOU JUST HAVE ANOTHER F COMPUTER MORE OR LESS YOU CAN USE BUT YOU CAN USE IT WITH YOUR YOUR OWN MOUSE AND KEYBOARD
EXACTLY
BUT UH IN CONTRARY TO TO HAVING AL ANOTHER KEYBOARD AND MOUSE THAT ONLY ONE PERSON CAN USE
NOW THE DIFFERENT PERSONS CAN USE THE THE SCREEN UM AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE WITH THE MOUSE
I'LL S STILL THE SAME SUBJECTS
IT'S IT'S COLLABORATIVE WORK
BUT UH
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH UH AUDIO PROCESSING AND UH L. E. D.
SO
ANYWAY UH I THINK THE THE DETAILS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT THAT IMPORTANT
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT FIRST WE WANT TO TO HAVE SOME EVENTS LIKE TWO PEOPLE ARE TALKING OR ONE ONE STARTED AND ANOTHER STARTED AND UH WELL
MORE OR LESS BROKE INTO THE SPEECH OF THE FIRST PERSON AND SO ON
AND THEN YOU CAN START TO VISUALISE THESE UH DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
WELL THAT'S UH I GUESS IT'S FIRST PROTOTYPE I YOU SEE WE START WITH UH PEOPLE TWO PEOPLE TALK OR AND DON'T AND DON'T THEY
UH AFTERWARDS UH ONE COULD IMAGINE THAT YOU FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN DETECT THAT SOMEONE IS A BIT ANGRY OR IS UH YELLING
AND WI WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS WITH UH WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS ON ON TABLE YOU COULD UH DISPLAY THIS THIS UH GIVE SOME FEEDBACK
BUT UH
YEP
THAT'S UH
ONCE WE GET THE HARDWARE
MM
YES
EVERYTHING FROM UM MULTI SWITCH ADMINISTRATION OF UH AUDIO AND HOW YOU CAN UH ANALYSE IT UH WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN GET OUT OF SPEECH AND SO ON
SO
PROBABLY IT'S UH IT'S F BE A GOOD IDEA IF YOU HAVE S TWO UH WITH UM WITH SOURCE LIKE UH BOOKS OR WEB PAGE CENTRE
GIVE A LOT OF INFORMATION HOW IT IS AUDIO PROGRAMMING AND SO ON WORKS CETERA
MAYBE YOU YOU KNOW SOME AT LEAST A GOOD BOOK THAT'S UH DEALING WITH THIS STUFF
MM-HMM
AND IS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS IN REAL TIME
THAT'S UH
NO
YEAH BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF O SOMEONE IS STANDING THEN
YEAH
NO NO NO
IN FACT UH THAT'S UH IT'S ANOTHER THING THIS OPTIC
WELL UH M WE HAVE
YE
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT REALLY AN EXTENSION TO THE FIRST BOX JUST AN INDU INDUSTRY STANDARD UH UH PROTOCOL BETWEEN THESE TWO UH
WELL WELL THERE'S A SPECIAL PROTOCOL TO TO DELIVER UH AUDIO SIGNALS AND UH ITS PATH THROUGH UH O UM
WELL ACTUALLY JUST TO HAVE THE THE ICSLA E UH POSSIBLY TO TO BRANCH ICSLA
HMM
NO
UH-HUH
WELL UH SO YOU SAY THIS ONE ALREADY WORKS TO UH TO TELL THE THE DIRECTION
UM WOULD IT ALSO WORK IF YOU PLACED UH THE MICROPHONES AT AT THE BORDER OF THE TABLE
YOU SEE NOW YOU YOU HAVE IT QUITE CENTRAL
AND UH WHAT HAPPENS IF IF YOU PUT THEM HERE ON AROUND THE TABLE
WOULD IT WORK AS WELL
OR
YOU JUST DIDN'T TRY
OR
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH IT IS CLEAR THIS
NO
MM-HMM
NO
YOU LOSE INFORMATION
UM
YEAH
WELL THAT'S SOMETHING WITH F. F. T. S
AND THE PHASE
SO THE MAGNITUDE YOU DON'T REALLY USE
OR AND FOR THIS UH
WELL UH UH UH I DID A SPEECH PROCESSING UH COURSE AND I'M NOT SURE IF THEY A UH THEY ALSO UM MM LEARNS THAT THAT
WE MORE USED THE FACE THAN THE MAGNITUDE
SO UH I GUESS THE
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
AND WHAT HAPPEN UH IF TWO PERSON ARE TALKING AT THE SAME TIME
THIS IT JUST GET TWO SECTORS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN OTHERS NO
SOUNDS
WELL UH UH
MM-HMM
YEAH
NO IT'S MORE THAN
NO IT'S UH
MM-HMM
I'LL SHOW YOU THIS AFTERWARDS
NOW IF YOU DON'T REALLY DETECT THE PITCH CH CAN SAY THAT UH NO PERSONS
IT'S NOT REALLY MEANINGFUL
WELL IF YOU DO THIS
SOMEHOW
MM-HMM
MM THANKS
WELL
OTHERWISE IT COULD ALSO JUST RELY ON THE FREQUENCY BAND SEPARATION AND DETECT THAT WAY THE DIFFERENT PERSONS AND TH THEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE AROUND THE TABLE THESE
BUT UH
WELL D DEPENDS WITH HOW YOU DO IT
BUT IF IF YOU PLACE THE THE MICROPHONES UH N YEAH
UH
THAT WAY YOU CAN SEPARATE WHERE WHERE IS THE THE VOICE LOUD WITH UH OR THE LOUDEST
WELL IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT THING AND UH YOU DON'T REALLY GET UH A NAME FOR IT
BUT UH
AT THE END IT IT DEPENDS A BIT WHAT YOU WANT
IF YOU ARE
I GUESS IT'S COMPLETELY OTHER APPROACH
SO UH
EXPENSIVE
CA CAN YOU UH SAY A NUMBER
OKAY
OKAY
SHOULD I START
MAYBE BY PRESENTING THE PROJECT LITTLE BIT
OKAY SO HISTORICALLY IT WAS UM UH LAST YEAR PROF DELAMBEAUX IN UH HIS C. S. C. W. CLASSES UH ASKED THE STUDENT TO DESIGN A TABLE
AND ALL THE STUDENTS AND GUILLAUME WA WAS A STUDENT OF THIS CLASS WAS VERY EXCITED UH TO DESIGN SUCH A TABLE
SO HE DECIDED TO UM TO MAKE MORE RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC
SO THE GENERAL TOPIC UH IS ABOUT UH INTERACTIVE TABLE UM DISAPPEARING COMPUTER UM WHAT IS THE OTHER ONE
UM UM NA UH IN THE GENERAL FI FIELD OF UH COLLABORATIVE COMPUTER SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING
SO THE IDEA IS WE HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE COLLABORATING UH IN A PEDAGOGICAL PURPOSE
AND UH WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE PUT A COMPUTER IN FRONT OF THEM UH IT DOESN'T HELP FOCUSING ON COLLABORATION
SO IF WE MAKE THE COMPUTING UM FUNCTIONALITIES DISAPPEARING ON ON THE IN THE FURNITURE
IN THE WALL OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT WE MAY MORE EFFICIENTLY SUPPORT UH COLLABORATION THAN THE THE LEARNING
SO I ARRIVED UH IN JUNE SOMETHING LIKE THAT A COUPLE OF MONTH AGO
UH GUILLAUME AND UH MICHAEL UH ARE TWO STUDENTS THAT ARE WORKING UH FOUR FOUR MONTHS TO THEIR MASTER PROJECT
AND THEY START WORKING ON TWO UH DIFFERENT UH SUB PROJECTS
SO GUILLAUME IS WORKING ON THE NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE
IT'S UH WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING ABOUT UH TODAY
SO THE IDEA IS UH OKAY W WE HAVE IN THE LAB A NOTION ABOUT UM ROOT MIRRORING
THE IDEA IS IF WE CAN PROVIDE A FEEDBACK TO PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER UH IT MAY HELP THEM SELF REGULATING THEIR ACTIVITY THEIR COLLABORATION
SO COULD BE NORMATIVE OR NOT
IN OUR OWN CASE WE WANT TO HAVE UH A TABLE THAT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE BY BY STUDENTS
UH AT O. P. F. L. WE ARE UH
AT O. P. F. L. UH THE LEARNING CENTRE WILL BE BUILT IN A COUPLE OF UH YEARS
SO THE IDEA WE WE WILL HAVE PLENTY OF ROOMS UH LIKE IN LIBRARIES OR MEETING ROOMS WHERE STUDENT WILL ARRIVE AND WORK
SO IF WE HAVE THIS TABLE UH THAT IS ACCESI ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS IF THEY ARRIVE IF WE PROVIDE A FEEDBACK OF UM WHO IS TALKING
UM INSTANTLY THE UH AT ONE MOMENT OR UH THROUGH TIME OR THE TURN TAKING
UH MAYBE THEY WILL JUST BY SEEING AN EXPLICIT UH FEEDBACK OF THAT THEY WILL UM TAKE PROFIT UH OF IT AND UM
YES
THE IDEA IS TO HAVE UH PERIPHER PERIPHERICAL UH INFORMATION
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON UH WHAT'S GOING ON UH WHAT ON THE FEEDBACK
SO WE DON'T WANT HISTOGRAM OR VERY PRECISE INFORMATION
BUT WE WILL UH HAVE LEDS THAT WILL BE DISTANT
THERE WILL BE SIX CENTIMETRES BETWEEN EACH LED WITH A BLURRING GLASS
THE IDEA IS TO HAVE MORE UM A KIND OF UH ART ARTISTIC UH FEEDBACK TO HAVE A KIND OF GENERAL FEELING OF WHAT'S GOING ON
SOMETHING ABOUT
UH DANCE
FOR PRACTICAL REASONS
WE KEPT UH ONE PAPER SHEET
SO UH THE FIRST SHAPE OF THE TABLE THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE OBVIOUSLY IS ONE OF THE FACTOR ON THAT WILL CHANGE THE COLLABORATION
SO UH BUT WE DON'T WANT TO START WITH TOO MANY PARAMETERS
SO WE START WITH A TABLE THAT IS APPROXIMATIVELY THE TAB UH OF THE TABLE WHERE WE ARE NOW
AND WE WILL HAVE UH A SQUARE SHAPE LIKE THIS THAT WILL BE HERE AND A SECOND ONE THAT WOULD BE THERE
SO WE WILL HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
LIKE THIS
THAT WILL BE THE OUR FIRST UH REAL PROTOTYPE
OKAY
AND THE SO THIS L. E. D. MODULES ARE BEING UH DESIGNED UH NOW
WE SHOULD HAVE THEM IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS
AND UH WE WILL BE ABLE TO UH START UH EVALUATING UH THE PROTOTYPES
UH UH ABOUT THE C. S. C. W. CLASS THAT WILL START AT THE END AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER
UH SO THE STUDENT WILL BE ASKED TO DESIGN UH A TABLE
SO TO FIND THE SHAPE UH OF THE TABLE TO GET UH WHO THE AND PUT THAT UH ON THE UM ON TABLE UH LEGS
AND WE WILL UH SO AT THE BEGINNING WE WANTED TO PUT THIS L. E. D. MODULES UH IN THE TABLES
BUT WE WON'T MAKE IT BECAUSE UH FOR SOLIDITY REASON OF THE TABLE
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT VERY UH STRONG UH WOOD
UM SO WE WILL RATHER BEAM UH THE L. E. D. ON THE TABLE
SO WE COME BACK TO A MORE RICHER DISPLAY
B BUT WE WILL UM RESTRICT IT TO A SMALL UH TO HAVE THE SAME DISPLAY
LED LIGHTS UH THAT WILL BE DISTANT UH SIX CENTIMETRES BETWEEN LEDS
SO WE WILL SIMULATE OUR
AND WE HAVE YEAH
AND WE HAVE THE FEELING THAT TO HAVE THE INFORMATION EMBEDDED IN THE TABLE MAKE IT PART OF THE TABLE
IT I DON'T KNOW WE'LL WE WE WILL TRY UH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT UH WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS PROTOTYPE
WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT
OKAY UH MAYBE BEFORE UH GOING ON ON THIS SUBJECT WE CAN TALK TALK A LITTLE BIT ON UH
HUH
SO BASED ON THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE P. F. L. STUDENT HAVE THEIR OWN LAPTOP UH THE IDEA IS THE SIMILAR IDEA UH IS TO OKAY
PEOPLE ARE COMING ON A SHOULD BE ABLE TO VERY EASILY UH USE SOME UM RESOURCES OFFERED TO THEM
SO SO THE IDEA IS TO HELP THEM SOCIALISING ORGANISING THEIR OWN WORK
AND UH NOT IN A CLASSROOM SETTING BUT IN A SOCIAL PLACE WHERE THEY COULD GATHER
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
OKAY
SO UH MAYBE WE CAN FOCUS A LITTLE UH UH BIT MORE ON THE WHAT WE HAVE DONE ABOUT UH THE NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE
TELL YOU ABOUT UH WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN ON THE SO WE START SO GUILLAUME STARTED BY UH DEVELOPING THE APPLICATION THAT GET THE AUDIO INPUT
SO WE WANT IT TO HAVE A MODULAR ARCHITECTURE TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE EACH UH LAYER SEPARATELY
SO THE AUDIO INPUT UH IS QUITE BASIC NO
WE U WE USE UH SOUND CARDS TO TO GET UH THE SIGNALS AND TO DETECT TO UH ON TO HA AND WE HAVE A THRESHOLD TO DETECT UH WHEN SOMEONE IS TALKING
AT LEAST WHEN THE NOISE IS UH AT UH IS BIGGER THAT UH SPECIFIC LEVELS
AND THEN WE GET THIS INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE TALKING NOT TALKING AND TO SAY OKAY UH
THIS ONE IS TALKING FOR X. TIME OR UH HAS BEEN TALKING UH X. PERCENT OF THE FIVE LAST MINUTES
OR TWO PEOPLE ARE TALKING TOGETHER
SO THIS IS MORE SEMANTIC UH LAYER
UH WE CALL THAT INTERACTION UH MODELS
AND UH UH SO WHEN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS ARE TRIGGER ARE DETECTED WE TRIGGER ON THE INTERACTION EVENT
SO VERY SIMPLE ONE COULD BE ONE PERSON IS TALKING
SO IT'S UH THE EASY ONE
IT'S STILL IN PROGRESS
STILL IN PROGRESS
SO THE LAST LAYER IS ABOUT THIS VISUALISATION
W WE WILL UH WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE VISUAL GRAMMAR MEANING THAT WHEN WE HAVE AN INTERACTION EVENT THAT IS UH FIRED
WE UH WILL ASSOCIATE UH A WAY OF VISUALI VISUALISING IT
SO FOR INSTANCE IF SOMEONE IS TALKING UH WE CAN JUST HAVE A LIGHT THAT WILL CENTRE ON THE POINT THAT IS UH CLOSE TO HIM
THAT COULD BE AN UH INSTANT UH FEEDBACK
AND IF HE HAS BEEN TALKING MAYBE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE LAST FIVE MINUTES AS ME
UH UH IT IT MAY BE REFLECTED AS THE UM INTENSITY OR SIZE OF A S A CYCLE
CENTRE ON THE SAME POINT
AND THEN IF THERE'S TURN TAKING WE CAN SHOW WAVES OF LIGHT GOING FROM UH ME TO YOU UH OR FROM OTHER PEOPLE
OR USING THE CENTRE PART OF THE TABLE TO SHOW SOME SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THE UM UH MORE GENERAL UH DYNAMIC
OR LAUGHING
YES
IN UH WE CAN CHANGE INTE SO WE HAVE UH EIGHT BY EIGHT UH TWO TIMES LEDS
EACH UH LED IS ACTUALLY THREE LEDS UM
TH UH M. G. B. LED
AND WE CAN CHANGE THE INTENSITY
SO IT'S ALREADY QUITE A RICH UH FEEDBACK
YES
AND JUST A LAST THING
SO THIS TABLE IS UH TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
IT'S UH ONE OBJECT THAT WILL UH G PROVIDE A FEEDBACK TO THE TERMINAL USERS PEOPLE COLLABORATING AROUND UH THE TABLE
BUT IT ALSO A TOOL FOR US AS A RESEARCHER TO TEST UH BOTH THE INTERACTION EVENT WE WANT TO DETECT AND TO TEST THE VISUALISATION
SO UM WE WILL BE ABLE TO EDIT SOME UH INTERACTION RULES AND THE VISUALISATION UH GRAMMAR
AND UH WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROCESS TO POST PROCESS SOME CONVERSATION JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND TO UH HAVE THESE UM MODELS ON FEEDBACK WORKING WHEN PEOPLE ARE USING THE TABLE
SO I THINK IT WAS
YES
UM
MAYBE WE COULD SUMMARISE THE QUESTION WE WERE THINKING ABOUT
SO BASICALLY WHAT WE WANT WE WANT TO KNOW WHEN A. IS TALKING B. IS TALKING AND UH
BASIC INFORMATION WE NEED
MAYBE WE CAN UH GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND THEN YOU CAN ORGANISE YOUR OWN
UM I WOULD JUST ADD SOMETHING
UH WE ARE NOT INTERESTED SO MUCH IN SOUND LEVEL BUT UH IN THE LEVEL OF UH THE SOUND THAT CORRESPONDS TO VOICE
MM MM
OKAY IT WAS JUST A
OKAY
GO ON
AND I WOULD ADD UH ONE MORE
IT'S ABOUT UM BECAUSE WHAT WE CAN UH RECORD IS UH SOUND UH ORIGINS
SO IN PO UH SO NO SONIC POINTS
BUT WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IS PEOPLE
SO THE QUESTION IS IF SOMEONE IS MOVING I'M TALKING HERE I STOP TALKING I'M GOING HERE I'M TALKING
HOW TO DETECT THAT IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE
IF WE WANT TO UH INTEGRATE INFORMATION TO SAY THESE PEOPLE HAS UH SPOKEN SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE TIME IN THE FIVE LAST MINUTES
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO UH TO KNOW THAT IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE
SO RIGHT NOW OUR PRACTICAL SOLUTION IS TO HAVE ONE UH MICROPHONE CLOSE TO UM EVERY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO SIT
SO WE CAN INFER THAT IF A SOUND IS COMING IN THIS AREA IT'S THE SAME
SO KIND OF TRICK
BUT FOR THE BEGINNING IT'S ENOUGH
AND A LAST QUESTION THAT IS RELATED T UH OUR LAST IF I NOT FIND ANOTHER ONE UM
ABOUT PEOPLE IF SOMEONE IS LEAVING OR IF SOMEONE UH MAYBE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING EV UH QUITE COMPLEX EVEN FOR YOU
IF SOMEONE IS STAYING HERE BUT IS QUIET OR LEAVING HOW CAN WE DETECT THAT SOMEONE IS HERE BUT QUIET
OKAY
I KNOW
BUT HOW TO INTEGRATE THE INFORMATION
UH
NOT NOT YET
MAYBE LATER ON
BUT
OH THE WAIT AND THE SIT
OR PUTTING HIS BAG ON THE OKAY
BUT IT WAS JUST TO IT'S A QUESTION
I'M NOT SURE WE WILL TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT TODAY
UH NOT DIRECTLY
BUT IT'S UH RELATED
SO IN A COUPLE OF DAYS WE WILL GET THIS UM UH THE FIRE WIRE UH BOX
SO WE WILL WE HAVE CHOSEN ONE THAT HAS EIGHT UH LINE UP
SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE LINE IN SORRY
SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO PLUG UH UP TO EIGHT UH MICROPHONES WITH UH JACK PLUGS TO EXHALE AIR WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING WITH EIGHT MORE X. L. R. UH MICROPHONE WITH ANOTHER BOX
SO WE HA WE HAVE THE COMPUTER WE HAVE THE THE MAIN BOX WITH THE EIGHT LINE INS
AND IT'S FIRE WIRE
IT IS OPTIC
TO HAVE EIGHT MORE X. L. R. IF WE NEED IT
BUT WE ARE NOT SURE TO TO BUY IT NOW
BUT WE CAN EXTEND IT
THAT'S UH
YES
WELL
WE ARE NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF MICROPHONE WE SHOULD USE
SO WE WANTED TO UH THAT'S A FIRST THING
SO WE WANTED TO HAVE OPEN POSSIBILITIES
AND SECONDLY MAYBE WE WILL USE THIS BOX YOU KNOW TO GET UH DATA
I DON'T KNOW IF IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT MAYBE IN ANOTHER PROJECT IF WE WANT TO HAVE COMMENTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE OR O ELSEWHERE
UH GETTING UH HAVING THE POSSIBILITY OF USING X. L. R. MICROPHONE COULD BE UH UH COULD BE NEAT
SO EVERYTHING IS OPEN
NO WE ARE NOT VERY INTERESTED IN
MORE THAN ONE
MM MM MM MM
OKAY
THEY WON'T HAVE NICE LIGHT UH LIGHTING ON IN FRONT OF THEM
THEY WOULD MAYBE CAREFUL
BUT
OKAY
SO MAYBE W UH YOU COULD PRESENT A DIFFERENT WORK UH YOU HAVE DONE
AND UH I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ARE
SO YOU TOLD US IT WAS DIFFERENT PIECES MORE THAN ONE INTEGRATED DEVICE
OH UH
WHAT WOULD BE THE D DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DETECTING THE AVERAGE OR DETECTING THE MAXIMUM
WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
IT'S A KIND OF FILTERING ALREADY
SIXTY
OKAY
AGAIN
UH-HUH
OKAY
SO IT'S THIRTY TWO MILLISECOND FRAMES TAKEN EACH
AN IDEA
SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO WHY ARE YOU OVERLAPPING
I HAVE A ROUGH IDEA
BUT UH WHAT IS THE MAIN INTEREST
MM-HMM
YEAH AND IT'S KIND OF CRAPPY
PRECISE
OKAY
OKAY
MM MM MM
SO YOU USE THE FIRST AND LAST POINT TO DETECT WHAT IS BETWEEN
MM-HMM
MM MM
OKAY
SO YOU ARE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
CORRESPONDING TO BREATH OR A LITTLE NOISE
'KAY
BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MICROPHONE ARRAY HERE
STRONG BACKGROUND NOISE
SO PHASE
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OKAY
SO THE PHASE THE TIME BETWEEN UH AUDIO SIGNALS FOR UM FOR THIS MICROPHONE ON THIS MICROPH
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND DO YOU GET SOMETHING ABOUT THE UM DISTANCE OF THE GUY THAT IS TALKING OR JUST A DIRECTION
OKAY
MM MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YOU MEAN THAT EACH PERSON WILL HAVE A SPECIFIC FREQUENCY BECAUSE I THE WAY HE'S TALKING OR HIS LOCALIZATION
IT'S A KIND OF UH SPEAKING STYLES
BOTH
I DON'T REALLY GET YOUR LAST UH DIAGRAM YES
SO IT'S AT ONE GIVEN MOMENT STILL
OKAY SO YOU CAN SAY THAT F THIS FREQUENCY BELONGS MORE TO THIS PERSON AND THIS ONE MORE TO THIS ONE
BUT SOME FREQUENCY MAY MAYBE ARE NOT USED NEITHER BY UH GUY THE GUY ONE OR THE GUY TWO
OKAY
MAYBE THEY ARE USING THE SAME FREQUENCY
SO YOU NEED TO S
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
AND CAN YOU DETECT IF SOMEONE IS LAUGHING OR ANGRY D UH THERE IS KIND OF SIGNATURE UH EVEN IF WE CAN'T REALLY TRUST IT UH UH S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME
UH
AND DO PROCESSING ON IT
OKAY
PITCH
IT IS PITCH
LI OKAY
WHAT IS A
EXCUSE ME
UH-HUH
OKAY
OKAY
SO WHERE ARE YOU REPRESENT THE PHASE
OKAY
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM MM MM
BECAUSE IF WE ARE DISTRIBUTING THE MICROPHONE ALL AROUND THE TABLE THEN WE COME BACK TO THE ENERGY SOLUTION
IS IT WHAT YOU SAY
WITH THE ENERGY DISSOLUTION OR WITH UH F. F. T. TOO
OKAY
BUT THERE ARE MANY MANY THINGS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
MM-HMM
MM MM YEAH
WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE
YOU WILL NOT COMPARE EACH MIC WITH UH ALL THE OTHER ONE
BUT JUST COMPARING THIS ONE WITH THE
MM OKAY
OKAY
BUT WHAT ARE UH UH
SO WHAT ARE THIS MIC FOR INSTANCE THE ELECTRET MIC
OMNI DIRECTIONAL
ELECTRET
OKAY
YES
AND WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT COMPARING ENERGY IN THE CASE WHERE A MICROPHONE WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED ALL AROUND THE TABLE UH YOU'RE COMPARING ENERGY AND THE TIME DELAY
BECAUSE TIME DELAY IS IS TOO SHORT TO BE COMPARED OR CAN BE NEGLECTED
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
YEAH
IT'S TIME
COOL
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OK OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
SO DO YOU KNOW UH WHICH WAY YOU GIVE THE FEEDBACK
LIGHT OR I SAW SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
MAYBE MORE COMPLEX YEAH
YEAH
SO TH
HMM
BUT YEAH
TO THE BORDER BASICALLY SOME DISTANCE
OR
OKAY
O OKAY
OBVIOUSLY YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT
HMM
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
BUT DON'T YEAH
DON'T YOU THINK WITH A BEAM ALSO YOU HAVE LESS PROBLEMS WITH THE SHEETS
OR YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
YEAH
OKAY
CONFUSING YEAH
HMM
OKAY
NO IT'S A CHOICE
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEP
OKAY
YEAH
BUT PHYSICALLY IT'S JUST UH SOMETHING FLAT ON THE TABLE AGAIN YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
HMM
OKAY
YEAH SO IT'S DIFFERENT BUT STILL UH YEAH IT'S SAME
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
HMM
RIGHT
HMM
OKAY
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OR TOO LONG
OH JUST KIDDING
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
AH SO YOU HA YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE MULTIPLE COLOURS
OR YEAH
SORRY DIDN'T GET THAT
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
HMM
NO IT'S QUITE CLEAR
SO UH I GUESS YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH AN ARRAY MAYBE
MM-HMM
YEAH
OR YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT'S GOOD IDEA
JUST GIVE SOME QUESTIONS UH
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU MEAN THE TOP OF THE WAVE FORM
OKAY
YEAH
OH
OKAY
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
SEPARATION UH
YEAH
HMM
MM-HMM
WELL YOU NEED A CAMERA
OBVIOUSLY
I MEAN WILL YOU HAVE A CAMERA
MAYBE YOU CAN DETECT BREATHING
YEAH
YEAH THAT YOU COULD DO
OR ON THE TABLE UH THERE SHOULD BE WELL
OKAY UH
OKAY
MM
WELL
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO YOU I THINK GUILLAUME SAID THAT'S OPTIC SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OR
OKAY
SO YOU YOU NEED A DIFFERENT YOU NEED A MICROPHONE WITH UM A DEVICE INSIDE RIGHT
HO HOW DOES IT WORK
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
MM
HMM
IT'S ANOTHER FIRE WIRE OR NOT FIRE WIRE BUT UM
OKAY
BUT CONCRETELY YOU WOULD USE THAT TO GET HIGHER QUALITY SIGNALS
Y THAT'S ALL
YEAH
AH OKAY OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
OKAY
AND HOW
HMM
HMM
YOU MEAN YOU MEANT EIGHT KILO UH SAMPLING FREQUENCY
YEAH
UH WE USE SIXTEEN
SO THAT'S EIGHT KILO BAND WIDTH
SIXTEEN KILO UH SAMPLING FREQUENCY
IT IT'S NOT BAD
UH IT'S QUITE DECENT
UM
MM F BEFORE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS UH TH THERE'S ALSO A POINT OF UH PRECISION OF LOCALIZATION IF YOU USE AN ARRAY
SO IF YOU USE HIGHER FREQUENCIES YOU CAN GET MORE PRECISE LOCALIZATION
BUT MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED IT
UH THAT I CAN'T ANSWER DIRECTLY
UH IT DEPENDS ON YOUR SET UP YOU KNOW
UM YOU HAVE TO TEST BASICALLY
UM
Y YOU GET UH THE ANGLE
THE MOST PRECISE ONE IS THE ASYMMET IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE
THEN YOU ALSO GET ELEVATION
BUT IT'S NOT VERY PRECISE
IT'S MORE OF AN INDICATION
AND RADIUS IS VERY BAD
IF YOU USE A PLANAR GEOMETRY LIKE THIS ONE
YEAH
UM YOU CAN USE MULTIPLE ONES AND DO SOME UM UM TRIANGULATION
EIGHT EIGHT
THESE ARE ONLY SCREWS
MICROPHONES ARE ON BOTTOM
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
A CUBE
OKAY
YEAH THEN YOU MIGHT GET UH BETTER DIRECTION IN ELEVATION
BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S REALLY RELEVANT
UM NO
SO
UH IF PEOPLE MOVE FORWARD YEAH
AH THE RADIUS
TH THEN THE R THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE GEOMETRY IT'S THE UM I YOU NEED MORE THAN ONE BASICALLY
WITH ONE YOU WILL ONLY GET DIRECTION
MICROPHONE ARRAY
SO
MM
DIRECTION YEAH
UM
YEAH
IT'S A DIFFERENT OPTION YEAH
UM WE HAVEN'T TRIED THAT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE SPECIAL KIND OF TABLE
MORE UH THIS IS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT WE HAVE LIKE A BOX JUST BRING THE BOX AND PUT IT
SO IT UH WE COULD NOT CONSIDER THAT
BUT IN YOUR CASE IT COULD BE INTERESTING YEAH
UNLESS PEOPLE PUT SOMETHING ON THE MICROPHONE
BUT UM
YEAH
RIGHT
BUT THAT I'M I THINK AFTER THE MEETING WE CAN GO AND TALK TO OLIVIER ABOUT THAT
I'M NOT THE PERSON FOR HARDWARE
YEAH
YEAH I'LL T I'LL TRY TO PRESENT UH I GUESS IT CORRESPONDS TO YOUR QUESTIONS
YEAH
SO THE THE LOWEST LAYER WOULD BE THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS
UM YOU ASKED ABOUT HOW TO DETECT UM ACTIVITY
CURRENTLY YOU'RE THRESHOLDING THE T MAXIMUM OF YOUR WAVE FORM RIGHT
AH AH
OKAY
AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PEAK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
OKAY
UH
YEAH
YEAH
AND YOUR SECOND QUESTION UH WAS ABOUT F. F. T. WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH F. F. T.
SO UM THE APPROACH WE'RE TAKING HERE IS TO ANSWER BOTH QUESTIONS THE SAME TIME
WE USE F. F. T. TO DO DETECTION
WE DON'T USE THE WAVE FORM THE RAW WAVE FORM
SO UM
WE SPLIT UM WE SPLIT THE SIGNAL IN SMALL FRAMES LIKE SIXTEEN MILLISECOND
SIXTEEN
UM EACH FRAME IS TAKING THIRTY TWO MILLISECOND OF SIGNAL JUST TO GIVE AN IDEA
AND THERE IS A ONE FRAME EVERY SIXTEEN MILLISECOND AND THEY OVERLAP OF FIFTY PERCENT
UM
YEAH
EACH SIXTEEN MILLISECOND
WELL TH THESE ARE DETAILS
IT'S JUST TO GIVE AN IDEA
UM
WELL IT'S UH THE THE C
BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN YOU DO F. F. T. Y IF I'M GETTING INTO DETAILS BUT YOU YOU APPLY UM A WINDOW TO AVOID EFFECT
SO THE BEGINNING AND THE END IT IT I IT'S NOT CRAPPY
IT'S JUST NOT VERY MUCH REP REPRESENTED BECAUSE YOU APPLY UM A WINDOW WHICH HAS THIS SHAPE HAVING WINDOW
SO THEY'RE VERY YEAH
NO I'M SAYING UH WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR SIGNAL YOU TAKE ONE FRAME YOU APPLY THE WINDOW UH AND THE WINDOW IS SIMPLY UH COEFFICIENTS YOU GIVE
AND YOU GIVE HIGHER COEFFICIENT TO THE MIDDLE THAN TO THE EXTREME
SO IF YOU DON'T DO OVERLAP Y YOU WILL LOSE INFORMATION AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END
OKAY
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO OVERLAP
I MEAN UH IT'S UM
HMM
UM C. M. U. NO
IS IT FROM C. M. U.
UM UH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
F. F. T. IS ONLY A TOOL
UH UM UH WHAT WE DO RELEASE A PHASE DOMAIN ANALYSIS
WE ONLY USE THE PHASE BETWEEN THE MICROPHONES
UM
YEAH BUT ALSO FOR DETECTION
YEAH
UM WE HAVE A WAY SO UM I DON'T THINK I SHOULD GET INTO DETAILS
BUT BASICALLY THE BEGINNING IS YOUR SIGNAL WHICH YOU SLICE INTO FRAME
YOU DO F. F. T. ON EACH MIC
AND THE END IS UM A NUMBER OF UH FREQUENCY BEAMS WHICH ARE USED BY EACH PERSON TO UH EXPLAIN ROUGHLY
S SO WHEN YOU SPEAK SPEECH IS WIDE BAND
SO UM THE MORE ACTIVE YOU ARE THE MORE BAND WIDTH YOU USE
SO YOU WILL GET A LARGE VALUE OF BAND WIDTH FOR PEOPLE WHO SPEAK
AND UH FOR THE OTHERS IT WILL RANDOM
IT WILL BE A SMALL VALUE
OR JUST BACKGROUND NOISE
AND SO UH
YEAH
'CAUSE ONE PROBLEM IF YOU USE ENERGY BASED METHODS WHICH IS PROBABLY MORE UH THE THING YOU'VE BEEN USING SO FAR
IS THAT IT'S NOT UM QUITE RELATED TO LOCATION
SO YOU CAN HAVE UM UH FOR ONE PERSON YOU CAN HAVE UH A HIGH ENERGY SIGNAL WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE AND VISA VERSA
UM I THINK IN YOUR CASE YOU'RE QUITE INTERESTED IN THE LOCATION
SO I WOULD ADVISE TO UM USE MORE UH PHASE DOMAIN METHODS
UM
ONCE YOU HAVE THE FIFTY FOR EACH FREQUENCY YOU HAVE UH THE MAGNITUDE AND THE PHASE
SO YOU CAN COMPARE THE PHASE OF THE MICROPHONES
AND THIS IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE DIRECTION OF THE PERSON
UM
SOMETIMES WE USE IT BUT NOT IT'S NOT THE FIRST THING WE USE
I KNOW IT'S A BIT COUNTERINTUITIVE
BUT UM MAYBE I'LL GO T TO THE BOARD
YEAH
OKAY
R RIGHT FOR A SINGLE CHANNEL IT'S NOT VERY MEANINGFUL
BUT HERE IT'S RELATIVE PHASE BETWEEN THE MICROPHONES
SO UH I'LL JUST TRY TO UM S SUMMARISE
NO THAT'S WHAT I DON'T DO
UM THIS WOULD BE VALID FOR UH LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH A SINGLE CHANNEL
THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA
BUT IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE MULTIPLE CHANNELS
UM
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE FOUR OF THEM
WITH F. F. T. YOU CAN JUST UH AS I SAID L LOOK AT THE PHASE BETWEEN THE MICROPHONES AT A GIVEN FREQUENCY
UM IT IS LINKED TO THIS VALUE YEAH
UH BASICALLY THE TIME YOU'RE MENTIONING IS THIS VALUE
AND THIS IS THE FREQUENCY
AND THIS IS AN ANGLE IN RADIANS
SO UH F. F. T. GIVES YOU A MEASURE OF THESE VALUES
UH THIS I CAN POINT TO A PAPER UH I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING
BUT WILL GIVE YOU IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR TABLE UH WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED HERE
IS AN APPROACH WHERE UM TH UH YOU DIVIDE THE SPACE IN SECTORS
FOR EXAMPLE TEN SECTORS AROUND THE TABLE
AND UH
IN EACH SECTOR YOU WILL GET THE VALUE
NO
IT'S UH APPLICATION DEPENDENT
FOR EXAMPLE UM
WELL THIS IS NOT
AND ON THIS ONE YOU COULD HAVE A LARGE VALUE
ON ON ON THOSE ONES SMALL VALUES
UH THESE ARE NUMBER FREQUENCIES
WHICH WE ESTIMATE WITH SEVERAL STEPS FROM THESE MEASURES
SO TO CONCLUDE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS UH WE ESTIMATE HOW MUCH OF THE FREQUENCY SPECTRUM YOU ARE OCCUPYING WHEN YOU SPEAK
OR I AM OCCUPYING IN THIS DIRECTION WHEN I SPEAK
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT UM THIS IS QUITE GOOD TO DO UH DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION AT THE SAME TIME
BEC BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN A SECTOR SPACE THERE IS UH UH THIS MUCH ACTIVITY
YEAH YEAH
UM
MORE RECENTLY UM I'VE WORKED ON UH
UM PROLONGATING THIS WITH A MORE PRECISE DIRECTION EVALUATION TO KNOW WHERE IN THE SECTOR THE PERSON IS
SO THAT UH THAT'S NOT MUCH WORK
ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS THIS IS CAN BE THIS CAN BE DONE QUITE QUICKLY
THEN YOU
YEAH Y WELL I I USE A VALUE
BUT THEN YOU'LL GET TWO LARGE VALUES
YEAH
SO
NO
JUST DIRECTION
YEAH
WELL F YEAH I IT'S NOT UH I IT'S AN INHERENT PROBLEM TO THE GEOMETRY YOU USE
YOU CAN FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU USE ANOTHER ARRAY UH YOU CAN INTERSECT LINES OF DIRECTION
UH
MM MAYBE
UH UH I W MM I WOULDN'T TRUST IT TOO MUCH
CLASSICALLY WHAT YOU DO IS YOU EXTRACT THE SIGNAL OF THE PERSON
UM ONE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT UH ARBITRARY THINGS
THEY REPRESENT THE NUMBER FREQUENCIES WHERE A GIVEN PERSON IS DOMINANT
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TWO OF THEM WHICH MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR SEPARATION
YOU KNOW ALREADY WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THIS PROCESSING UH W WHICH PART OF THE FREQUENCIES OF THE SPECTRUM UM BELONGS TO THIS PERSON AND TO THAT PERSON
AND THEN IT'S EASY TO SEPARATE THE SIGNALS
UM BOTH
IT'S IT'S MORE AN INSTANTANEOUS UM THIS IS STILL INSTANTANEOUS
THIS IS FOR ONE TIME FRAME
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL YOUR FREQUENCIES FOR EXAMPLE UH ZERO TO FOUR KILOHERTZ
UM
YOU CAN SPLIT IT AND SAY UH ALL THESE PARTS BELONG TO PERSON ONE HERE
AND UH ALL THE OTHER PARTS BELONG TO THE OTHER PERSON
THAT'S CORRECT
BUT THEN UH YOU CAN LOOK STATISTICALLY IT WI IT WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE UM BECAUSE THE R OF UH OF THE DIFFERENCE LEVEL
YEAH
IT'S UH YOU CAN LISTEN TO IT YEAH
AND THEN YOU CAN DO SOME UH MAYBE HIGHER LEVEL UM ANALYSIS WHERE YOU GET THE PITCH OF THE PERSON OR
THIS
YEAH YEAH
AND THIS IS
EXACTLY
YEAH
THEN IT'S UH RANDOM
AND THAT'S WHY YOU GET THESE VALUES UH WHICH ARE RANDOM
YEAH
YEAH BUT THIS IS VERY RARE
AND WHEN IT HAPPENS ONE IS ALWAYS MASKING THE OTHER IN PRACTICE
SO UM
YEAH
NO NO
BUT UH I'VE I'VE SEEN QUITE A FEW PAPERS I I'VE N NOT DONE IT MYSELF
I'M REALLY ON THE LOWEST LEVEL
UM BUT UH ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS AS I SAID
YOU CAN UH SEPARATE THE SIGNALS
AND UM
DO DO PROCESSING
UH
SO UH YOU CAN GET PITCH RATE OF SPEECH
THAT'S QUITE EASY
PITCH UM THE UH UH TIMBRE EN FRANCAIS
UM SO UH FOR DIFFERENT PERSON THIS MIGHT BE QUITE DIFFERENT
AT LEAST FOR MALE FEMALES
AND UH RATE OF SPEECH
LIKE IF SOMEBODY IS TALKING VERY UH IN A VERY ENERGETIC MANNER IT MIGHT BE QUITE FAST
UH OR JUST ENERGY ALSO
ONE
YEAH ALSO
UM THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE WITH PEOPLE ARE BRINGING LAPTOPS
UM
THEY WILL B YEAH
THEY MIGHT BE DETECTED AS ANOTHER ANOTHER SOURCE
UH SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO UH CLASSIFY THE SOURCES AS HUMAN OR MACHINE
BUT AGAIN YEAH I THINK ONCE YOU SEE THE SPECTRUM IF IT'S JUST PURE AND STABLE
UH
ALSO YEAH IF IF THERE'S NO PITCH
SO UH
YEAH
YEAH
SO ALL WILL GO AND BE DETECTED THERE
YEAH
SO W WHAT YOU'RE MENTIONING IS A PAIN FOR US
BUT FOR YOU IT MIGHT BE 'CAUSE WE'RE ONLY INTERESTING IN GETTING THE SPEECH
BUT FOR YOU IT MIGHT BE QUITE UH QUITE GOOD YEAH
SO I'VE TO AVOID UH FILTERING AND SMOOTHING
'CAUSE AS SOON AS YOU DO THAT UM YOU EXCLUDE SOME OF THE INFORMATION
SO IT'S BETTER TO KEEP IT FOR THE LATEST STAGE
SO UM UM ON TOP OF THIS THERE'S ANOTHER PART UH WHICH IS MORE LINKED TO THE TRACKING
ALL THIS WAS FOR ONE TIME FRAME
SO UM
YEAH YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT
UM IN SPEECH IT'S UH STATIONARY OVER TEN TWENTY MILLISECOND
AND WE MAKE A STATIONARY ASSUMPTION A LOCAL STATIONARY T. ASSUMPTION UM WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO USE F. F. T. AND BLAH BLAH BLAH
UH NOW IN SPITE OF THAT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE USE MUCH LONGER WINDOWS WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM
BUT
UH IT'S A BIT TOO MUCH I THINK
UH LIKE SOME VERY SMALL WORDS LIKE YES THEY MIGHT BE TWO HUNDRED MILLISECOND
OR THREE HUNDRED MILLISECOND
UM
YEAH THEY MIGHT BE BLURRED WITH UH SILENCE
SO YES
YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT JUST TO SAVE PROCESSING TIME LIKE USE SLIGHTLY LONGER FRAMES
YEAH AT M AT MOST YEAH
UM
SIMPLY BECAUSE I'VE USED ONE HUNDRED AS A MINIMUM LENGTH OF A SPEECH WORD
YEAH SO
UM
NOW ASSUMING YOU HAVE DONE THIS FOR EACH TIME
I IF THIS IS YOUR DETAIL OR I SHOULD USE A DIFFERENT
UM
IF THIS IS YOUR ASYMMET AT EACH TIME YOU GET A DIRECTION
SO ASYMMET IS YOUR DIRECTION IN HORIZONTAL PLANE
IT'S AN ANGLE
LIKE NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST
AND
YEAH
NO NO OF THIS IS UH REALLY DIFFERENT
I'M JUST SAYING THAT UH ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS FOR A GIVEN TIME FRAME YOU CAN HAVE A DIRECTION OF THE PERSON AT LEAST IN TERMS OF SECTOR
AND IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO GIVE A MORE PRECISE DIRECTION QUITE QUICKLY
SO UH THIS WAS KIND OF THE LOWEST LAYER
NOW THIS IS A LAYER JUST ABOVE IT WHICH MIGHT INTEREST YOU
UM IF YOU REPEAT THAT OVER TIME
YOU WILL SEE PATTERNS UM
FOR EXAMPLE UH AT TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS
TWO DIFFERENT PERSON WILL SPEAK
SO YOU CAN CLUSTER THOSE
AND YOU WILL SEE THAT UH IF IT'S LONG ENOUGH IT'S SOME SIGNIFICANT EVENT
UM THIS CAN BE DONE QUITE CHEAPLY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
A COST
YEAH TH
UM WELL I USE MATLAB
SO IT'S NOT PERFECT
IT'S LIKE THREE FOUR
YEAH
BUT NOT EVERYTHING IS UH UM SIMPLE LINEAR
ESPECIALLY THIS PART
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT LINEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MAXIMUM ENERGY IN A FREQUENCY KIND OF
THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART IS HERE
WITH MATLAB I HAVE THREE FOUR TIMES REAL TIME
UM YOU CAN DO SUB OPTIMAL PROCESSING AND UH FOR EXAMPLE HERE I'M CONSIDERING ALL POSSIBLE PAIRS OF MICROPHONES
UH WHICH IS TWENTY EIGHT AND THE PROCESSING IS DIRECTLY UM R PROPORTIONAL TO THAT
SO UM YOU CAN SAVE ON THAT
BUT THEN YOU LOSE A LITTLE BIT ON PRECISION
ALSO I I'M USING ALL THE SMALL FRAMES WITH FIFTY PERCENT OVERLAP
I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY NEED ABSOLUTELY TO DO THAT
IT'S NOT THAT GOOD IN TERMS OF UH DIRECTION
UM
YEAH I WOULD BE CAREFUL WITH THAT
LIKE FIVE SIX IS UH DECENT
UH SIX I WOULD SAY YEAH
EIGHT YEAH UH I GET DOWN NOW TO ONE TWO DEGREES UH ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR
UH SO YOU MIGHT NOT NEED THAT
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
MIGHT NOT BE
UM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT COULD BE SUFFICIENT TO UH YEAH DEFINE ENOUGH SECTORS AND
NO
NO
SO IT'S ARBITRARY
I USE TWENTY DEGREE SECTORS
UH 'CAUSE I HAD TO CHOOSE A VALUE
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU
UM
YEAH
YEAH
UM
SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY YEAH
IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE HAVING A LAPEL YEAH
UM
YEAH
I THINK IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD IDEA ACTUALLY
UM
WELL UH
IF YOU ARE ABLE TO CALIBRATE YOUR MICROPHONES UM THE ONES WHO ARE CLOSER TO THE PERSON WILL GET MORE ENERGY
UM SO YOU CAN COMPARE THAT
IT'S POSSIBLE
SO
YEAH
UM
I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT
UM
ON THE SIDE I'VE DONE SOME SINGLE CHANNEL WORK WHICH CAN MAYBE HELP
UM 'CAUSE UH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE NOT DEFINITE ON THE GEOMETRY RIGHT
YEAH
UM M THIS PART IS QUITE SPECIFIC TO A MICROPHONE ARRAY WHERE LIKE THEY ARE CONCENTRATED IN UH SOME PLACE LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT YOU CAN KIND OF COME BACK TO THAT ALSO
UM
UH F. F. T. ALSO
YEAH YEAH
R RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
IT HAS TO BE AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE
YEAH
YEAH
TRUE
YEAH
WE CAN ALSO CONSIDER DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONES
YOU KNOW NO
UM SO YOU CAN UH THEIR PATTERN IS UH NOT UH THE SAME UH DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION WHERE THE PERSON IS
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS A DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE POINTING THERE YOU WOULD GET MOST OF MY ENERGY BUT LESS FROM YOU ET CETERA
YOU CAN ALSO DO MICROPHONE ARRAYS WITH DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONES
UH UM MIGHT NOT BE RELEVANT
BUT UM
UH
MORE OR LESS
IT'S IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT
I MEAN UH I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
THEY'RE O YEAH OMNI DIRECTIONAL YEAH
M UH I GUESS SO
IT'S THE SAME YEAH
EXACTLY THE SAME YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
QUITE EXPENSIVE
YEAH THEY ARE UM HIGH QUALITY MICS
UH I THINK WE CAN LEAVE THIS QUESTION FOR OLIVIER
YEAH
NO NO
Y YOU WOULD UH ASSUME
UH YOU WOULD NEGLECT IT
THE TIME DELAY IS IS VERY SMALL
IT IT'S ONLY USED FOR UH GETTING THE A DIRECTION WHEN YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE ARRAY
BUT IN THAT CASE IT'S NOT RELEVANT
UM YOU WOULD ASSUME THAT THEY ARE ROUGHLY SYNCHRONISED NOT NECESSARILY VERY PRECISELY AND UM COMPARE THE ENERGY LEVELS
BUT I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH THAT
UM
NOW I DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO USE AH IT'S ALMOST OKAY
YES
MM-HMM
ACTUALLY UH YOU CAN T PERHAPS JUST UH JUST
TH THERE IS ONE FREQUENCY THAT IS THE BASE FROM FOR UH
OKAY
BOTH
MM THE PITCH AND UH AND THE FREQUE
OKAY S AND YOU CAN MEASURE MEASURE THAT
OR
OKAY
AND I IS IT UH EXPENSIVE TO DO
BUT IN FACT IF Y YOU SPEAK OF UH A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT EXPENSIVE AT THE END YOU HAVE UH SOMETHING THAT IS
HMM
SO YOU HAVE TO DO F. F. T. BECAUSE OTHERWISE
MM-HMM
YES
YES BUT IT
I IT IT IS IM
IT I IT YES IT IS IMPORTANT FOR DETECTING PATTERNS
BECAUSE UH IF YOU SAY UH LET'S SAY UH W HOW MUCH THE PERSON UM HAVE SPOKEN OVER THE THE FIVE LAST MINUTES UH
UH IF SOMEONE COME AND YES
YES YES
Y
THIS IS UH MM
OKAY
SO I UH THIS IS ONLY BASED ON UH YOU GIVE UH THE SPECTRUM AND UH UH OKAY
MM-HMM
YES
BUT UH THE LAST ONES ARE ALWAYS THE
MM NOT REALLY
MM YES
HMM UH I I SAID UH WE WANT T TO KNOW TO UM TO DO SEPARATION JUST BECAUSE OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION
I MM THIS IS NOT THE YES
YES NO BUT BUT IN FACT WE HAVE UH YES WE ARE DESIGNING UH A NOISE SENSITIVE TABLE JUST F FROM YOUR RING
BUT WE ARE ALSO DESIGNING UH A PROTOTYPE UM TO ANALYSE THE CONVERSATIONS
SO UH WE MIGHT ADD THERE A LOT OF UH FEATURES
OKAY
AND UH I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS UH PERHAPS IF YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE SPEAKING UH SPEAKING UH AT THE SAME TIME
UH I DON'T KNOW IF UH VOICE RECOGNITION OF AN UH SUCH A STREAM IS UH REAL
OKAY
YES SO THAT'S FINE
MM-HMM
SURE
YES IT'S NOT UM EVERY IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR NOW BUT
MM-HMM
YES
AND UH UH ANOTHER WHAT UH
UM I DON'T REMEMBER
YES ALSO UH TO TO EXTRACT THE CONTEXT
MM BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW THE WORDS THAT ARE SPOKEN YOU CAN LET'S SAY UH SOMEONE SAY UH HE'S ANGRY UH ABOUT THE WORD HE'S SEEN
YES
YOU MI YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD UH THIS KIND OF THIS IS NOT IN UH MY PROJECT BUT
YES
UM
YES
AND HAVE A SPECIAL EVENTS TRIGGER IF
SURE
SURE
NO IT'S IT DOESN'T SOUND SIMPLE BUT YES YOU CAN YES
SURE
YES IN FACT UH FOR NOW WE ARE USING UH A KIND OF CALIBRATION BUT UH IT'S STILL UM
YES
YES UM UH BUT IN FACT YOU HAVE TO SIT IN FRONT OF THE MICROPHONE AND IT'S UH YEAH
PEOPLE ONE SPEAK AND PEOPLE TWO AND PEOPLE THREE AND YOU ARE JUST UH SUBTRACTING THE THE LEVEL THAT YOU YOU KEPT IN THE OTHER MICROPHONES
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY JUST UH A LAST QUESTION UM WHEN YOU MENTIONED IT
UM IF I'M SPEAKING VERY UH HOW DO YOU SAY IT UM YES I'M JUST SPEAKING ONE WORD EVERY UH EVERY ONE SECOND
YES A
UH IS THE THE EVENT THAT IS DETECTED IS UM WILL BE UH A SUM OF UH SMALL PARTS
THERE WON'T BE UH OKAY
SO YOU YES YOU HAVE TO TO REPROCESS TO UH TO SAY LET'S SAY YES
THERE IS A VERY SMALL UM INTERVAL
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER IT UH
BECAUSE THIS IS YES THIS IS ONE THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ONE INTERV INTERVENTION
IT MIGHT BE
THIS IS NOT A VERY UH EASY PROBLEM
I'M DONE
SURE YES
AND YOU CAN CODE JAVA
YOU CAN CHOOSE MATLAB
YES SURE
YOU HAVE TO CODE IT UH DIRECTLY TO THE MACHINE
HMM
MY SHEET IS VERY UH FILLED UP
I WILL TAKE YOURS
OKAY
MM-HMM
OR ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PITCH NO
DON'T ASK ME HOW IT'S DONE I I KNOW THE THEORY SO YEAH
ISN'T IT THE PITCH AND THE FREQUENCY
THE BASE FREQUENCY OF THE
AND IF YOU HAVE BOTH YOU CAN UM WELL YOU CAN COMPARE THIS TO TO ONE STORED AND SO GET OUT UH WHICH PERSON IT IS
PARDON
AND UH WELL THE THINGS THAT MAKE THE SOU THE VOICE
YEAH
AND AND THE THE HOLES IN YOUR HEAD EVERYTHING THE THE NOSE AND SO ON
AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY UH UNIQUE FOR EV WELL ALMOST UNIQUE FOR EVERY PERSON SO
WELL ONCE YOU GET THIS INFORMATION YOUR FREQUENCY AND UH YOUR VOCAL CONTRACT OR HOW IT'S CALLED
UH Y YOU CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO COMPARE TO TO TO THE FRAMES HERE
NO BUT
NO NO NO NO
THAT THAT THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE THROUGH THROUGH THE VOICE HERE YOU TAKE A VOICE OF SOMEONE AND THEN YOU CAN GET OUT THIS INFORMATION
IT'S IT'S NOT P IT'S CLEAR IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT S IT'S ENOUGH TO TO TO USE IT FOR FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND UH
UM NOT NOT THAT WELL UH AS FAR AS I KNOW
ACTUAL
IS IT CALLED P. C. M.
I THI UM WELL IT'S IT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGY S YEAH
IT'S MORE OR LESS USED THIS TO COMPRESS AUDIO
I HAVE TO I WANT TO CHECK IT I CAN SHOW IT YOU AFTERWARDS
WELL I DID A COURSE ABOUT IT BUT UH I SHOULDN'T SAY IT TOO LOUD BECAUSE UM THE PROFESSOR IS WORKING HERE AT IDIAP
I SHOULD REREAD WHAT I SIGNED THERE SO
WELL UH IT I'M EVEN NOT SURE IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHICH PERSON IS TALKING BECAUSE UH IF UH IF IT I THINK ABOUT A TABLE
OR SO SOMETHING UH PHYSICAL
UH YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW IN IN WHICH CORNER OF THE TABLE UH SPEECH IS COMING AND NOT UH WHICH PERSON PRODUCED THE SPEECH SO
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT REALLY RELATED TO THE AH YEAH I SEE IT'S UH YOU NEED A BIT BOTH UH
SOUND
YOU MIGHT MIGHT WANT TO DO
YOU NEED TO SEPARATE IT
NO BUT I THINK ONCE YOU HAVE THE VOICE FOR A PERSON
YOU CAN START TO DO THIS AND UH ONCE UH PEOPLE HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION OR UH FAR ENOUGH TO T
MM UH
I THINK SO
THE LINK
MM
OKAY
NO I THINK DOES THIS WORK EMAIL
DOES IT WORK IF I PUT IN MY EMAIL AND UH
NO IF IT'S NOT UH I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO INSTALL IT AND SO ON
UH NO NO NO YOU SEE UH I THOUGHT YOU CAN PUT IN HERE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS AND AND JUST UH DO THIS AND THEN IT MAILS ME
YEAH YOU SEE I WANT TOO MUCH
AND AFTER ALL MATLAB IS ALSO PROGRAMMING SO IT
MM-HMM
SO
THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION
OKAY
YES
SO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO FIRST QUESTION
OKAY
AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SAME PEOPLE MOVING WITH THE CLUSTERING
UH-HUH
SO THIS ONE
WHAT
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T REALLY GET THE POINT OF COMPARING THE PITCH THE PITCH IS THE IS THE FREQUENCY THAT IS OKAY
AND THE WAY YOU TRANSFORM IT UH V BY THE MOUTH
YOU WERE COMPARING WHAT WITH WHAT
UH-HUH OKAY OKAY
SO UH
AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT COMPARING WHAT WITH WHAT
OKAY
BUT YOU WANT TO HAVE THE INFORMATION BECAUSE THE THE MOUTH YOU MOVE IT
TO SCAN T ALL THE USER
OKAY
OKAY SO YOU HAVE THE P THE PITCH AND YOU HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE VOICE DYNAMIC OR
MM MM MM
EMOTION THE INVOLVEMENT IN A DISCUSSION
IF YOU ARE SAYING OH YEAH YEAH WE SHOULD
OKAY
IN C. P. U. YOU MEAN
NOT REALLY FAMILIAR
HMM
OKAY SO YOU ARE THE EXPERT
CAREFUL YOU ARE RECORDED
OKAY
OKAY SO ALL THIS STUFF IS DONE FROM THE F. F. T.
ALSO LOCATION TO IDENTITY
UH
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
BUT TO GET A CLUSTER THE LOCATION THAT IS UH A PLACE WHERE UH NOISE IS REGULARLY COMING FROM
MM-HMM
MM MM MM
BUT FOR INSTANCE FOR A SETTING LIKE UH HERE IT WOULD BE ENOUGH BECAUSE WE ARE NOT MOVING
OKAY RIGHT
BUT WE ARE UH TARGETING A PLACE WHERE WE DON'T KNOW I WHERE IT WILL BE MORE FLEXIBLE
SO WE NEED MORE THAN JUST UH LOCATION IF WE WANT TO UH
MM MM
I AGREE
MAYBE JUST
I THINK IT MAY IT MAY BE OKAY BUT IT DEPENDS HOW LONG
HMM
FROM TH FROM THE LOCATION
OH
MM-HMM
WHEN ARE YOU PLANNING TO FINISH YOUR
OKAY
MORE EXTENSIBLE
MM
I DON'T KNOW HOW MU MAYBE WE WOULD BE MORE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME PEOPLE MORE THAN KNOWING THAT IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE
OR TO DETECT THAT SOMEONE IS MORE THAT WAS NOT TALKING BEFORE IS TALKING NOW
YES
MM
MM
OKAY
THAT ARE FURTHER DIRECTIONS
PROFESSOR WAS INTERESTED TO KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIM
AH SOMEONE IS TALKING ABOUT ME LET'S LISTEN
AND LIGHTING A ON HIS OFFICE
OKAY SO ARE YOU DONE W WITH WHAT YOU WANTED TO PRESENTED US UH IN REGARDS WITH THESE QUESTIONS
MM MM
THREE PAPERS ABOUT
MM-HMM
OKAY
IT'S N NO PROBLEM
NO MORE TIME FOR PROBLEMS
OKAY
UH UH
MM MM MM
SLOWLY
MIGHT
FOR THE FIRST APPLICATION WE WILL DO WITH UH PROTOTYPES IT WILL BE MORE ABOUT QUANTITY UH OF SPEECH OR HOW LONG
HOW MUCH SOMEONE SPEAK BUT WHEN WE WILL GO TO FINAL UH DETAILS
IF I'M TALKING AND SOMEONE SAY YES YES YES FROM TIME TO TIME IT SHOW THAT HE'S PARTICIPATING
AND OBVIOUSLY IT MAKES DIFFERENT THAT IF SOMEONE IS TALKING AND ONE IS REPLYING NEVER UH NOR MOVING OR NOR HAVING EYES OPEN
OKAY
GO THROUGH THEM
OKAY
NO I THINK UH I THINK WE HAS ALREADY HAVE PLENTY TO READ
TRY
AND THE APPLICATION YOU ARE USING ALL OF THEM UH Y EVERY TIME YOU ARE USING MATLAB OR YOU ARE PROGRAMMING EVERYTHING IS BASED BASED ON MATLAB
MM
MM MM MM
OKAY
I'M WRITING SO ONLY ME CAN READ
IT'S UH A KIND OF SECRET LANGUAGE
OKAY
SO B MAYBE I'LL GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTIONS
UM
YEAH
UM
YEAH
AND THIS ALSO UM ALLOWS YOU TO SEPARATE PEOPLE
UM AND THE QUESTIONS I DID NOT TALK ABOUT WAS UH GOING FROM LOCATION TO UH IDENTITY OF THE PERSON
UM
THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT YOU YOU NEED TO USE A SIGNAL YOU HAVE SEPARATED AND UH DO THE TYPE OF ANALYSIS I MENTIONED
UM FROM THE SPECTRUM YOU CAN TRANSFORM THE THE MAGNITUDE SPECTRUM AND UM UM BUILD MODEL OF THE PERSON
UM
YEAH PITCH AT LEAST
BUT PITCH IS
PITCH ISN'T IS NOT ENOUGH SOMETIMES
I IT'S A FREQUENCY YEAH YEAH
IT'S A FREQUENCY OF YOUR VIBRATION HERE
UH
YEAH
AND THEN IT'S TRANSFORMED THROUGH THE MOUTH THAT'S THE USUAL MODEL
YEAH
I YEAH UM IT'S NOT NECESSARILY DONE EXPLICITLY BUT IT'S EQUIVALENT TO THAT YEAH
SO AGAIN F. F. T. IS USEFUL TO DO THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS
UM
YEAH BUT IT'S QUITE PERSONAL
UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
IT IT'S AN INFORMATION EQUIVALENT TO THAT
IT'S MAYBE N YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THE WHOLE UH COMPLICATED MODELLING BUT
NO NO
YEAH RATE OF SPEECH IS ALSO POSSIBILITY
UM HOW FAST YOU SPEAK THAT'S QUITE PERSONAL ALSO
BUT IT VARIES OVER TIME UM DEPENDING ON EMOTION
THAT ALSO MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR YOU DETECTING EMOTION
YEAH YEAH
AND US YEAH YEAH SO THESE MEASURES ARE A WAY TO QUANTIFY THAT
UH P NO
NO NO IT'S NOT
WHAT W W WHAT IS M WHAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE IS TO UM TAKE THE DECISION FINALLY
SO YOUR DECISION CAN BE FOR EXAMPLE UH WHO IS IT OR IF THE PERSON MOVED
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLICATED THING LIKE THE PERSON GOES AWAY THEN COMES BACK TEN MINUTES LATER SITS AT A DIFFERENT PLACE
UH YOU WILL NEED TO BUILD STATISTICAL MODELS OF UM THE PERSON IDENTITY USING THESE MEASURES
SO THE ONES UM HE MENTIONED UM
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT
YEAH
YEAH
SO UM
NO
YEAH
S
YEAH
ALL I WAS SAYING IS THAT THESE DIFFERENT MEASURES ARE A WAY TO UH EVALUATE THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON
SO IF WITH LOCATION ALL YOU CAN DO IS EXTRACT SEGMENTS OF SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE BUT IT WILL NOT TELL YOU THAT THESE ARE THE SAME PERSON
IT'S JUST A LOCATION
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO THAT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR EXAMPLE FOR TEN MINUTES BUT THEN THE PERSON MIGHT MOVE OR A DIFFERENT PERSON MIGHT COME
YEAH
IT IS
WELL UNLESS SOMETIMES SOMEBODY GOES THERE OR YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT HMM
BUT THAT YOU CAN DO WITH LOCATION IF IT'S ONLY ON THE SHORT TERM
ON ON THE OFF LINE YEAH
I WOULD SAY YOU MIGHT USE THESE MEASURES IN A SIMPLE WAY IF YOU DO IT UH ON LINE
LIKE UM TO GIVE FEEDBACK
BUT UH YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT ANOTHER SIDE OF YOUR PROJECT IS ALSO TO ANALYSE OFF LINE
SO THERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A
WE HAD A STUDENT HERE HE FINISHED UH ONE OR TWO YEARS AGO BUT HE LEFT HIS SOFTWARE
AND HIS SOFTWARE IS PRECISELY TO DO THAT TO UM CLUSTER AT UH ANOTHER LEVEL
TO CLUSTER THESE SMALL CLUSTERS OF SPEECH UH GROUP THEM BY PERSON AUTOMATICALLY
Y NO FROM THE THESE MEASURES PITCH ETCETERA
SO UM
YEAH EXACTLY
SO I WOULD SAY FROM LOCATION AT THE LOWER LEVEL YOU CAN GET SMALL PARTS OF SPEECH AND THEN AT THE NEXT LEVEL
POSSIBLY OFF LINE YOU CAN UH GROUP THEM INTO UM A SPEECH SEGMENT
I'M HOPING TO HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO TRY UM DOING THAT BEFORE I FINISH MY THESIS
UM SO IF I MANAGE TO DO SOME UM UH PRACTICALLY USABLE SOFTWARE I'LL TELL YOU
UH IN FIVE SIX MONTHS ABOU APPROXIMATELY
MORE BUSY I WOULD SAY
YEAH
SO YOU SAID YOU WANT TO DO SEPARATION UM BUT EX EXACTLY YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
AH YOU WANT TO DO VOICE RECOGNITION
YOU MIGHT WANT
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
SO YEAH ONCE YOU HAVE LOCATIONS IT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM
UM
MM-HMM
NO NO YOU SHOULD SEPARATE THEM FIRST YEAH YEAH
SO
SO THE TYPE OF THINGS I PRESENTED CAN LEAD TO SEPARATION
UM IT'S ONLY A VERY SMALL STEP TO ADD
YEAH YEAH
ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE IF YOU WANT TO UM EX EXTRACT THESE FEATURES LIKE PITCH AND UH RATE OF SPEECH OR ENERGY SIMPLY FROM EACH PERSON
UM YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOME BA BASIC SEPARATION
'CAUSE QUITE OFTEN PEOPLE UH DON'T REALISE THAT THEY TALK AT THE SAME TIME UM INTERRUPT EACH OTHER
SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RECOGNISE A SPEECH FULLY AT LEAST UM YOU NEED YEAH
IT'S OKAY
YOU CAN EMAIL LATER
YEAH
UM
SO
YEAH
UH
OKAY
A SEMANTIC CONTEXT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THEN MM
HMM
SO IT'S UH
YEAH YOU COULD DETECT ONE WORD YEAH
KEYWORD SPOTTING YEAH
SO UM
YEAH
YEAH I I'LL JUST SAY UH IF YOU WANT I CAN POINT TO UM THREE PAPERS
UM BUT NO I THINK IT'S BETTER IF I JUST SEND YOU THE LINK IT'S PROBABLY SIMPLER
UH ONE IM IS ABOUT THIS UM SECTOR BASED STUFF LIKE UH THE LOCALISATION AND DETECTION
ONE IS ABOUT HOW TO TAKE THE DECISION THAT SOMEBODY'S ACTIVE OR NOT
UM IT SOUNDS SIMPLE AT FIRST YOU THINK YOU JUST PUT THE THRESHOLD AND THAT'S IT BUT UM THE PROBLEM IS UH THE
IT NO YOU CAN DO THAT
THERE'S NO PROBLEM BUT I IF YOU WANT YOUR YOUR SYSTEM TO WORK IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS LIKE CAFETERIA LIBRARY
UM THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE QUITE DIFFERENT SO A SINGLE FIXED THRESHOLD VALUE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM
S
YEAH
SO YOU CAN DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY THIS KIND OF THINGS
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE DOING THAT ALREADY BUT UH
OKAY
SO UH I HAVE ANOTHER PAPER WHICH MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR THAT FOR A SINGLE CHANNEL UH CALIBRATION
AND I'VE CODE ON LINE SO FOR THIS PARTICULAR ONE
AND THE LAST ONE I WOULD SAY IS UM THE CLUSTERING UM TO UM YEAH
THE CLUSTERING OF THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OVER TIME SO THAT YOU CAN GET SMALL CLUSTERS OF SPEECH
UM THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT BUT UH I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UM IN SPONTANEOUS SPEECH ALL THESE WORDS ARE QUITE SMALL
SO YOU NEED TO DO THAT UH ADEQUATELY YEAH
BUT OTHERWISE YEAH I'M DONE
HMM
YEAH YEAH
MANY SMALL EVENTS BASICALLY YEAH
YEAH BASICALLY UH I MEAN IT DEPENDS UH
YEAH EVEN IF SOMEBODY SAYS JUST YES
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU OR NOT
IT MIGHT BE
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
Y YEAH
YES
UM
SO I I'LL SEND YOU LINKS SOME OF THE PAPERS ARE LONG BUT YOU CAN JUST UM BRIEFLY LOOK YEAH
UM WE CAN GO AND SEE OLIVIER UNLESS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
HUH
WELL WE CAN TRY
BUT UH
WE HAVE YEAH WE HAVE O. C. R. BUT MAYBE NOT ON THIS COMPUTER
YEAH
THAT IS GOOD IDEA YEAH
IT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
ONCE I I UM CODED THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART IN C. JUST TO SEE SO YOU CAN HAVE A MIX OF BOTH
FROM MATLAB YOU CALL C. AND BACK
BUT THE DAY YOU WANT TO DO UH ON LINE REAL TIME STUFF NAH I WOULDN'T WOULDN'T TRUST IT
OKAY
HMM SO WE ALL ATTENDED INTERSPEECH NO
SO HOW MANY SESSIONS YOU ATTENDED
I MEAN DID YOU ATTEND ANY ANY SESSION
YEAH
THAT'S REALLY THAT'S REALLY YOUR SO ANY GENERAL IMPRESSION OR FEEDBACK
SO F FOR ANY OF YOU IT'S A FIRST CONFERENCE OR MAYBE FOR
NO I MEAN IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S UH INTERSPEECH IS REALLY BIG CONFERENCE FOR SPEECH SO DID YOU ATTEND BEFORE
UH OK OK YEAH O OK YEAH SO THEN YOU'RE HIDING A YOU HAVE ATTENDED BEFORE YES
YEAH I SEE SEE
YEAH YEAH
I T I
UH I THINK IT'S QUITE INTERESTING BUT ONLY ANNOYING THING IS THIS MULTIPLE SESSIONS
AND MOST SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T ABLE TO GO TO ORAL TALK THIS ORAL PRESENTATIONS MOST OF THE TIME
BECAUSE BECAUSE LIKE POSTERS IS YOU CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME POSTERS LOOKING AT M MANY POSTERS THAN SITTING TWENTY MINUTES FOR ONE ORAL PRESENTATION
SO IN T TWENTY MINUTES YOU CAN SEE AT LEAST TWO THREE POSTERS AND YOU CAN DIRECTLY TALK TO PEOPLE SO
EVEN I FOUND LIKE UH VERY FEW PEOPLE IN SOME ORAL PRESENTATIONS
I THINK MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE LIKE THEIR OWN POSTERS ONLY
YEAH HOW PRESENTATIONS ARE HARDLY HANDFUL OF LIKE F FIVE OR MORE
YEAH
AH OK
HMM YEAH
AH OKAY
YEAH
EVEN SOME PANEL DISCUSSIONS ON THAT HUMAN SPEECH RECOGNITION REDUCING GAP BETWEEN THE A. S. R. AND AND H. S. R.
IT WAS A BIT INTERESTING LOT OF ARGUMENTS AND
YEAH B DIFFERENTLY IT'S MAINLY THE DIFFERENCES DIFFERENT APPROACHES OF ENGINEERS VERSUS LINGUISTS OR PHONETICIANS AND YEAH MM
AH OKAY
YEAH EVEN THE PANEL DISCUSSIONS W I THINK ONE IS REALLY HELD IN SMALL ROOM SO PEOPLE WERE REALLY CROWDED
YEAH IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
AH OK WE WENT TO LIKE FAR SOUTH TO LAGOS AND YEAH THAT WA UH HA YEAH
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD THOSE BEACHES ARE REALLY GOOD
YEAH EVEN DOLPHIN IN THE YEAH
BUT THE WEATHER WAS REALLY HOT THE SOUTH IT'S MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE
UH
LISBON WAS GOOD UM LITTLE BIT BIT MM
YEAH EVEN LOCAL TRANSPORT IT'S IT'S
BUT YEAH MOST OF THE TIME THE BUSES ARE REALLY CROWDED
UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BIG CITY NO
NO LIKE
MM
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
NO RE YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOOD DIRECT BUS IS NOT GOOD LIKE
SO YOU CAN GO TO THE DIRECT UH CE CENTRAL PLACE AND THEN OCCAS UH
MM
YEAH DA
UH WHAT IS THE PLACE UH THE THE CENTRAL I MEAN WHERE WE CHANGE THE BUS TO YEAH IN THE YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN CHECK THE BOOKLET
YEAH IT'S THERE LIKE I USED TO FIND BUS NUMBERS FROM BOOK ONLY
OH OKAY
OH OKAY
IT'S LIKE UH IN
IT'S LIKE UH ALL THE SEMI TIED COVARIANCE MATRICES OR YEAH
SO DID THEY REDUCE IT'S IN BETWEEN THE DIRECT COVARIANCE THIS IS FULL COVARIANCE
SHOULD TRY TO REDUCE SOME PARAMETERS BY TYING
OH
UH
AH OKAY
YEAH
MM
IN YOUR TIE IN
NO I THINK THEY GOT GOOD RESULTS WITH JUST USING DIAGONALS OR DEFINITELY YEAH
YEAH
MM
MAYBE DECORRELATION AGAIN THEY DO D. C. T. OR K. L. T. OR THEY DO THAT
L. D. A. OR LIKE
YEAH
SO
NO BUT STILL THERE IS THERE IS STILL EV THAT'S WHY LIKE PEOPLE COME
YEAH DEFINITELY IT'S NOT OPTIMUM
SO IT'S IT'S ALSO LIKE DOING ALONG ALONG THE DIAGONALS ALL AGAIN
IT'S REALLY COMPUTATIONALLY REALLY UH YEAH SO SEE SUPPOSE IF THIRTY NINE IN TE THIRTY NINE TO THIRTY NINE FOR EVERY YEAH YEAH SO
UH THERE IS A THING
YEAH
NE NO PROBLEM BUT IF YOU SEE SO MANY MODELS AND SO MANY MIXTURES YEAH
BUT
YEAH THIRTY YOU CAN SEE YOU C YOU CAN'T REALLY LIKE EVEN YOU CAN'T THE MODELS ITSELF IS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT TIMES MORE THAN THAT SO
SO Y IF YOU HAVE LIKE FIVE MEGABYTES OR TEN MEGABYTES OF MODELS THEN YEAH
BUT EVEN I THINK IT'S REALLY BIT LIKE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE REALLY BIG SYSTEMS I GUESS LIKE STORING STORING ITSELF
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S REALLY TI
YEAH YEAH FOR EVERY YOU'RE SO YOU'RE TO STORE ALL THIS THIRTY
YEAH
SO FROM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SPEAK UH YEAH DIFFERENT TASK AND
SO UH I FOUND ONE PAPER INTERESTING
I THINK YOU KNOW VIVEK MOST OF YOU KNOW
UH THIS IS UH VIVEK'S PAPER ON LIKE VARIABLE SCALE FEATURE EXTRACTION
NORMALLY WE USE TO FIX IT WINDOW FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION LIKE TWENTY FIVE MILLISECONDS OR THIRTY SECONDS
HERE HE'S PROPOSING VARIABLE SCALE BECAUSE THE FIXED SCALE IS NON OPTIMAL FOR IT'S NON OPTIMUM BECAUSE LIKE FOR VOWELS YOU CAN HAVE M MUCH LONGER
AND FOR PLOSIVES AND THESE THINGS YOU REALLY SHORTER LIKE EVEN AROUND LESS THAN TWENTY MILLISECONDS ALSO
SO HE'S KI PROPOSING LIKE THIS VARIABLE SCALE WINDOW F UH KIND OF ONLINE FOR EACH SEGMENT
YEAH MM MM YOU CAN DO LIKE YOU CAN MEASURE AND YOU CAN DO BUT HE'S MM BASICALLY DOING SOME MM LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTING
SO IF SO THE MAIN IDEA IS LIKE SUPPOSE YOU HAVE UH ONE SEGMENT SO HE'S TRYING TO FIND THE STATIONALITY CAUTIOUS STATIONALITY OF THAT SEGMENT
YEAH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE LIKE BUT YEAH DEFINITELY YOU HAVE TO ASSUME SOME L UH LIKE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM SIZES OF YOUR OWN
SO HE IS USING MINIMUM OF MINIMUM IS UH I THINK TWE I DON'T TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISECONDS I THINK
MAXIMUM IS UH SIXTY MILLISECONDS
SO THE MINIMUM
NO NO I THINK A MINIMUM IS TWEN TWENTY MILLISECONDS IS I YEAH
TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISECONDS IS KIND OF SIFT
TWENTY MILLIS MINIMUM IS NO NO DE BECAUSE OF UH
NO YOU CAN USE MOL YEAH
NO MAINLY BECAUSE OF UH M. F. C. C. COMPUTATION BECAUSE YEAH IT BECOMES REALLY NOISY LIKE IF YOU S YEAH
TEN MILLISECONDS MEANS YOU HAVE ONLY EIGHTY SAMPLES FOR UH AND THEN YOU HAVE REFUSED TWENTY FOUR FILTERS THE FILTERS WON'T GET ANY SAMPLES SO
YEAH BECAUSE OF COMPUTATION
SO EVEN I I THINK EVEN ST UH HE CAN FIND LESS THAN TWENTY MILLISECOND WINDOWS ALSO ESPECIALLY FOR PLOSIVES UH
SHIFTING YEAH HE'S USING TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISE YEAH SHIFTING IS ALMOST SAME
BUT THE PROBLEM LIKE
HE
YEAH
YEAH HE'S KEEPING SAME NUMBER OF FRAMES
UH HE'S USING UH TWELVE POINT FIVE YEAH TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLISECOND
YEAH
NUMBER OF UH FRAMES
W YOU WANT TO
ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM'S AGAIN UH UH YOU SEE THE SHIFT IS THE NYQUIST FREQUENCY IF YOU COMPARED MODULATION SPECTRUM
SO AGAIN IF YOU CHANGE THIS SHIFT THE MOD THE NYQUIST THE MODULATION SPECTRUM NYQUIST FREQUENCY CHANGES FOR EACH WINDOW
SO IF YOU WANT TO DO AGAIN ANOTHER HIGH LEVEL FEATURE EXTRACTION AGAIN IT WILL BE PROBLEM SO
SO BUT HE'S UH LIKE HE'S HE DISCUSS I MEAN DESCRIBING THIS BECAUSE EVEN THIS ITSELF IS A PROBLEM
KEEPING THE F UH FIX TO FRAME SIZE BECAUSE YOU'RE ANALYSING YOUR THIS UH SEGMENT MANY TIMES
SO THIS SHIFT WILL SUPPOSE IF YOU FIND ONE SEGMENT OF SIXTY MILLISECONDS AND THEN YOU'RE DOING THIS TEN MILLISECOND SO EVERY ALMOST I THINK YEAH
MM UH YEAH FIVE FRAMES Y YOU'RE ANALYSING THE PREVI THIS ALREADY SEGMENT SO
SO AGAIN THIS MAY BLUR SOME FREQUENCY TRANSITIONS OR YEAH
BUT THE PROBLEM IS AGAIN THIS UH BOTTLENECK IS HERE LIKE YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR NYQUIST FREQUENCY MODULATION AND
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT'S SO UH SO THE MAIN IDEA IS LIKE FIRST TO TAKE THE SOME SOME WINDOW
SOME SAM SOME SAMPLES THEN HE ASSUME SOMEWHERE SOME VARIABLE AND POINT THERE IS A CHANGE
THEN THEN IT'S NOT SYMMETRIC I YOU CAN CHO UH Y IT'S BASICALLY UH TOO LIKE AGAIN DO FOR ALL THE SAMPLES IN THAT GYRO
SO THEN WHAT HE DOES IS LIKE HE PROPOSED UH LIKE SOME LIKE RATIO TEST BASED ON MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD
SO TH THA THAT IS REALLY SIMPLE LIKE SO WHAT HE DOES IS LIKE SO HE HE COMPUTES THE RESIDUAL
HE FIRST HE DOES THE L. P. ANALYSIS AND THEN HE COMPUTES THE RESIDUAL
AND HE TAKES THE RESIDUAL ENERGY OF F FULL SIGNAL LIKE GY GY GYRO SAMPLES
THE FULL SIGNAL
SO MAYBE I CAN
THE WH THE WHOLE WINDOW
NO THAT'S THAT LIKE HE ASSUMES YEAH SIXTY MILLISECONDS OR SOMETHING HE START WITH SO SO THEN HE CAN YEAH YEAH
YEAH THEN HE CAN SPLIT THAT WINDOW AT POINT N. SAY POINT N. SO THEN YOU WILL HAVE GYRO TWO NO YOU CAN SEGMENT IT MAYBE
YEAH SO YES HE'S SUPPOSED THIS IS YOUR P WINDOW
SO THEN YOU CAN MOVE YOUR LIKE THIS
YOU CAN MOVE YOUR POINT SO THAT THEN THIS WILL BE LIKE ONE AND THIS WILL BE SECOND
BUT AGAIN HE ASSUMES SOME INITIAL UH SIZES FOR THESE WINDOWS
YEAH
HE DON'T START WITH THE YEAH HE DON'T S YEAH START WITH GYRO SAMPLE OR SOMETHING
HE'S STARTING WITH UH SO THE L LEFT WINDOW IS STARTS AT TWENTY MILLISECONDS
SO SO YOU ALREADY HEAR LIKE S SUPPOSE THIS IS FULL SIGNAL YOU'RE ALREADY HERE
SO RIGHT WINDOW IS SHOULD END AT TWELVE POINT TWO SO YOU'RE TO SEARCH BASICALLY IN THIS RANGE
SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND THEN IF YOU THE MAXIMUM IS SIXTY MILLISECOND FRAME FOR HIM
SO IF YOU DON'T FIND ANYTHING
SIXTY MILLISECONDS
IF YOU D
NO THE POINT IS DEPENDING ON THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO
SO HE GOT SO HE SUPPOSED THIS SO THIS IS SUPPOSE SE SEGMENT ONE AND THIS IS SEGMENT TWO
SO HE COMPUTE THIS ERROR HERE
SO AND THEN HE P GIVES SOME KIND OF IN TERMS OF THIS RESIDUAL LETTER
SO THIS RESIDUAL LETTER IS FOR FULL GYRO SAMPLES
THEN THERE WOULD BE SUPPOSE THIS POINT IS SAY N.
SO GYRO TO N. AND THEN LIKE
SO THIS THE B BASICALLY THE MAIN HE QUESTIONS OR HERE
YEAH HE'S FOR FINDING THE LIKELIHOOD FOR FULL FRAME AND THEN IT'S BASICALLY LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST
SO HE'S COMPARING THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE FULL SEGMENT DIVIDED BY THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE THE SUB SEGMENTS
LIKELIHOOD OF THE UH LIKE THIS LIKELIHOOD IS UH THIS ERROR ESTIMATE OF THE RESIDUAL
SO RESIDUAL POWER HE CAN COMPARE T SO HE AFTER DO AFTER DOING L. P. HE CAN GET A L RESIDUAL AND THEN HE CAN COMPARE THE POWER OF THE RESIDUAL
SO THAT HE'S PROVING THAT POWER IS AGAIN MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATE OF YOUR L. P. PARAMETERS
SO THAT WHICH INTERESTING IT'S YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO DO A LOT OF COMPUTATION
YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE THE ERROR OF N UH RESIDUAL OF THIS FULL WINDOW AND THEN RESIDUAL OF ENERGY OF THE SUB WINDOWS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST DIVIDE THEM AND THEN THE ONLY THING IS LIKE AGAIN HE HAS TO USE SOME THRESHOLD TO DECIDE
THAT THAT'S ONLY THE P PROBLEM
HE GOT UH HE'S FOUNDING SOMETHING MORE UH AROUND THREE OR THREE POINT FIVE E. S. T. OPTIMUM THRESHOLD
BUT THE AND ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS LIKE IT'S NOT REALLY CHANGING SPEECH RECOGNITION WHATEVER SO NOT REALLY CHANGING BECAUSE OF THE THRESHOLD SO
UH YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO F LIKE FIDDLE WITH THRESHOLD A LOT SO MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THIS IS YEAH I UNDERSTAND
THIS IS THIS IS THE ACTUALLY BASICALLY SOME THEORETICAL PROOF LIKE MAYBE IF YOU WANT THRESHOLD YOU CAN SEE AND HE'S CODING FROM UH LEVEN LIKE UH
NO THIS IS FROM AGAIN YEAH STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING
WHAT THEY SAY HERE IS LIKE SUPPOSE IF YOU ANALYSE TWO DISTINCT OR UH THIS L. P. ANALYSIS IN THE SAME STATIONARY ANALYSIS WINDOW
THE CODING WILL ALWAYS BE GREATER THAN THE ONES RESULTING FROM THIS ANALYSIS IN TWO WINDOWS
TWO STATIONARY WINDOWS
SO THE HE'S BASICALLY BASED ON THIS THEOREM SO SO WHAT HE'S SAYING IS LIKE IF YOU DO THIS ERROR
IT WILL BE ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE MM TH THESE ERRORS OF TWO STATIONARY WINDOWS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH THIS MAYBE I THINK YEAH THIS HE'S GETTING SOME IMPROVEMENT BUT
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO HE'S JUST UH UH HE'S NORMALISING THE ENERGY COEFFICIENT BECAUSE ENERGY IS REALLY AFFECTED A LOT
UH SO HE'S LI
ENERGY LIKE BECAUSE C. GYRO COMPONENT LIKE SO HE'S USING M. F. C. C. SO HE'S NORMALISING THE C. GYRO COMPONENT FOR THIS T YEAH
POWER IS AGAIN LIKE YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S TIME LIKE YEAH
IT'S OKAY LIKE SAMPLES OR YOU CAN SEE ROOT MEAN SQUARE ENERGY OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
NO
NO N NO YOU VO WHAT YOU MEAN LIKE THE WINDOW LENT
THE SIXTY MIL NO IT I IT DOESN'T REALLY
UH BUT I THINK IT'S HE HE DOESN'T USE I GUESS BECAUSE UH UH THEN LIKE YOU JUST YOU TAKE THESE FEATURES AND YOU TRAIN MODEL SO
IT REALLY MATTERS WH WHAT FRAME SHIFT YOU'RE USING FOR MODELS LIKE BECAUSE HOW MANY HE NEEDS TO USE SAME FREQ
NO NO WAIT
NO HE WILL GET LIKE EVERY TEN MILLISECONDS HE GET ONE FRA ONE FEATURES
LIKE HE IT DOESN'T REALLY DEPEND BECAUSE SUPPOSE IF YOU TAKE YOUR T CASE
LIKE YOU YOUR WINDOW I MAYBE LONGER SO DOESN'T REALLY MATTER LIKE HOW WHAT SIZE WINDOW YOU USE OR NOT
BUT I TELL UH AT EVERY TEN MILLISECONDS WHETHER YOU GIVE SOME FEATURES OR NOT REALLY MATTERS NO
LIKE SO
SO IT DOE YOU CAN USE UH THIRTY MILLISECONDS OR FIFTY MILLISECOND WINDOW
SAME
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH FRAMING IT'S LIKE IT'S REALLY YEAH
YEAH IF YOU HAVE IF YOU'RE CHANGE FRAMING IT'S REALLY I THINK EVEN IT'S REALLY PROBLEM NO
LIKE IF YOU TRY EVEN MODELS ALSO I GUESS IF YOU CHANGE
IT'S NOT ONLY WITH THIS MODEL IT'S IN SPECTRA AND SHIFTS IN DELTAS BECAUSE
YEAH BUT IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED I THINK
IF YOU USE YEAH THAT BECOMES REALLY
YEAH
BUT THIS IS KIND OF INTERESTING
YEAH YEAH YEAH THE TEMPORAL DEC
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH FIRST THIS IS PROPOSED BY LIKE UH EVEN WE READ ONE PAPER IN OUR READING GROUP YOU REMEMBER THAT
I HAVE IMPLEMENTED IT'S QUITE WORKING WELL LIKE UH YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH HONZA IS ALSO WORKED FOR HIS BE YEAH
UH I YEAH
NE HE WAS RE HE WAS QUOTING
BUT THAT
YEAH HE WAS UH QUOTING THAT PAPER ALSO LIKE V HE WAS TELLING THIS UH THIS IS KIND OF OPTIMISATION CRITERIA WHAT THIS TEMPORAL DECOMPOSITION IS DOING LIKE
YOU'RE TRYING TO SEGMENT YOUR S SIGNAL INTO LIKE DISCREET WINDOWS AND THEN SO BUT HE WAS TELLING LIKE THIS UH RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPTIMATION AND AND THEN CAUTIOUS STATIONALITY IS NOT REALLY OBVIOUS
SO STATIONALITY IS AGAIN DIFFERENT NO
STATIONALITY IS THIS IS OPTIMATION WE WANT TO LIKE SEE SOME SIGNAL
FEW SEGMENTS WHICH CAN REALLY REPRESENT WHOLE SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY LIKE THIS MAY NOT BE REALLY
YEAH
YEAH THIS ONE YEAH HE'S GETTING SOME IMPROVEMENT N UH THIS IS A YEAH
NO NO NO THEY AGAIN
BUT AGAIN UH GETTING THAT TEN PAPERS IS REALLY DIFFICULT TASK
IT TAKES MAYBE YEARS AND AGAIN UH IT DEFINITELY LIKE WHO WILL WHO WILL CHOOSE THE TEN PAPERS LIKE AND IF WE ASKED YEAH
BUT YEAH THOSE THINGS ARE PRACTICALLY KIND OF REALLY BUT I THINK THIS KIND OF THINGS WHAT YOU SHOWED I MEAN WHAT YOU SAID IS REALLY GOOD
LIKE IF PEOPLE START IMPLEMENTING LIKE SOME PEOPLE PROPOSE SOMETHING IN FEATURE LEVEL SOME PROPOSE IN SOMETHING IN MODEL LEVEL BUT THESE TWO ARE REALLY INDEPENDENT NO
WHEN REALLY WORK COMBINE THESE TWO OR
YEAH ESPECIALLY FEATURES LIKE SUPPOSE IF SOMEBODY COME WITH DIFFERENT GOOD FEATURES AGAIN PEOPLE ST AGAIN USE M. F. C. C. S
NO NO IT IT'S NOT REALLY SURE ALSO MAKE SUPPOSE UH PEOPLE YOU CAN'T REALLY FORCE PEOPLE TO USE SAME FEATURES
SO SO THEY WO THEY WILL BE HAPPY WITH THEIR OWN FEATURES AND THEIR OWN SCRIPTS SO THEIR BIT RATE LIKE TEND TO CHANGE FEATURES EVERY TIME AND IT'S
HMM
BUT EVEN NIST YOU CAN
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THEN
SO AT LEA ESPECIALLY L. V. C. S. R. IN REALLY BIG SYSTEMS THEN PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE YEAH IT'S IT'S AGAIN YOU DON'T KNOW
OH
NO THEN UH THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE CONFERENCE IN THREE YEARS OR SOMETHING FOR SPEECH BECAUSE
BUT AGAIN LIKE
THAT'S SO YOU CAN PUBLISH ONLY ONCE IN THREE YEARS OR
YEAH
BUT EVEN PEOPLE ARE DOING SUPPOSE IN INTERSPEECH THERE WAS UH SOME CHALLENGE FOR SPEECH SYNTHESIS
SO SO WHAT'S IS UH LIKE IT CHALLENGE WAS REALLY GOOD LIKE SUP THEY GIVE THE DATABASE SO YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THAT DATABASE
WHAT TECHNIQUE T USE IS IT'S YOUR CHOICE LIKE BUT THAT DATABASE AND THEN THE RESULTS ANALYSIS IS THEY DECIDE SO
EVEN SPEECH RECOGNITION ALSO SOME TESTS ARE COMING LIKE FOR PHONE SEGMENTATION OR SOMETHING
PEOPLE GIVE SOME DATABASE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DIS YOU CAN USE WHATEVER YOU WANT AND YOU HAVE TO PRODUCE EVEN FOR FEATURES ALSO LIKE FEATURES ALSO I THINK
YEAH YEAH THE THEY THEY DESIGNED THE DATA SUCH A WAY THAT IT'S IT'S REALLY LIKE REALLY REAL UH DATA
NO NO FOR S NAY SPEECH SYNTHESIS IT'S LIKE THEY GIVE YOU SOME DATA
SO WHETHER LIKE YOU USE FOR TRAINING OR L YOU CAN YOU CAN DO LIKE DATA DRIVEN OR LIKE MODEL BASED APPROACH OR WHATEVER LIKE
AT THE END THEN THEY WILL ASK YOU TO SYNTHESISE SOME SENTENCE AND YOU HAVE TO SYNTHESISE THEM AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SEND THEM
YOUR TRAINING DATA ONL NO DEVELOPMENT TRAINING NO YEAH TRAINING
EVALUATE IT'S AGAIN SUBJECT TO S UH BECAUSE FOR SPEECH SYNTHES YEAH
YEAH LISTEN AND YEAH D YEAH EVEN UH THEY IT'S MOSTLY THEY USE NATIVE SPEAKERS ONLY BECAUSE THEY CAN REALLY JUDGE WELL SO
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO EVEN THEY PROPOSE SOME KIND OF WORD ERROR RATE
SO YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL SPEECH SO I THE SYNTHESISED SPEECH IS THERE ANY WORDS WHICH ARE NOT MATCHING
SO EVEN SPEECH SYNTHESIS THEY'RE ALSO UH INTRODUCED THIS W. E. R. TERM SO
UH
BUT THIS WAS REALLY QUITE SUCCESSFUL LIKE IN THIS CONFERENCE INTERSPEECH
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN UH I THINK EVEN THEY'RE CONTINUING THIS FOR UH NEXT YEAR AND
TEXT TO SPEECH
BUT UH I HEARD LIKE EVEN FOR I. CASSP NEXT YEAR THERE IS SOME COM UH LIKE COMPUTATION BY MARTIN KRUG SHEFFIELD
AND ON THIS FEATURE EXTRACTION STUFF AND SO AT LEAST IF YOU MAKE TASK SIMPLE FOCUS
THEN IT MAY BE GOOD TO COMPARE THESE FEATURES AND BUT IF YOU S USE SOME UH LARGE VOCABULARY SYSTEM
IT TAKES T SIX MONTHS TO BUILD AND AT THE END YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR FEATURES ARE REALLY UH SO
SO MAYBE THAT'S FOR LIKE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS USING P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S
IT'S IT'S SUCH A B LIKE LOT OF TIME INVOLVED SO YOU CAN'T REALLY CHECK MANY THI
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT AT LEAST IN IDIAP WE HAVE THIS NUMBERS RECOGNISER IS ALMOST KIND OF FREE SO EVERYBODY IS USING SO THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING NO
ALMOST ALMOST LIKE WE ARE PUTTING DIFFERENT FEATURES AND I THINK YEAH YEAH
NUMBERS RECOGNISER IS NOT REALLY DIFFERENT FROM LIKE UH A F AT LEAST IN IDIAP WE HAVE ALMOST SAME
BUT MAYBE YOU ARE USING TWENTY NINE THAT'S FOR YOU IT'S DIFFERENT BUT ONE MORE
BUT AT LEAST I TWENTY SEVEN
HEMANT AND WE'RE ALL USING TWENTY SEVEN SO
YEAH
YEAH
NO BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE USING ONLY DIGITS SO MAYBE THAT'S HOW YOU
NO BUT TEST SET IS DIGITS YOUR M MAIN TASK IS DIGITS K YEAH
THAT'S UH LIKE BUT O. G. I. NUMBERS ARE THERE LIKE NOW WE'RE LITTLE BIT CONVULSED
LIKE WE'RE USING TWENTY SEVEN PHONES AND BEFORE IT WAS LIKE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE
BUT IT'S BETTER LIKE ONCE YOU HAVE LIKE WHATEVER THE BACK END
THEN YOU CAN PUT FEATURES LIKE WHETHER THEY'RE GAMMAS OR LIKE SPECTRAL ENTROPIES OR M. F. C. C. S OR WHATEVER
THEN AT LEAST YOU CAN SEE
UH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT AURORA IS
AURORA TASK
SO BUT AURORA IS IT REALLY BIG DATABASE OR I MEAN HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES TO SET UP SYSTEM AND THEN
IT'S FAST NO
BUT THE PROBLEM IS AURORA AGAIN THESE MODELS ARE WORD BASED MODELS NO
YEAH SO AGAIN HERE WE USE TRIPHONES AND SO BUT DEFINITELY
I D IF WE WANT TO SHOW NOISE SETTING IT'S YOU HAVE TO SHOW ON AURORA ALSO LIKE AURORA IS REAL TIME
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT YEAH
YEAH AT LEAST I MEAN WHA THOSE STUDIES I THINK PEOPLE ALREADY DID FOR EVEN IN I. C. I. C. S. L. P. TWO THOUSAND TWO THERE IS SPECIAL SESSION ON FEATURES FOR AURORA
SO YEAH YEAH I YEAH YEAH
THIS ICSI FEATURES AND THIS UH S UH S UH O. G. I. FEATURES AND ALL THIS
SO THERE ARE ALREADY PEOPLE BUT AGAIN LIKE UH AT THE END LIKE FOR L. V. C. S. R. PEOPLE ARE USING P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S OR NOTHING OF THESE FANCY FEATURE
YEAH
NEW
BUT MAYBE MY HAVE A F FOR PUBLISHING ANOTHER PAPER OR SOMETHING
MM
YEAH
BUT MAYBE GUILLAUME YOU CAN TELL NO
LIKE UH YOU WORKED I WITH THESE SIEMENS PEOPLE OR NO SIEMENS OR THESE DAIMLER CHRYSTLER
WHAT KIND OF FEATURES DO YOU USE LIKE DO YOU USE UM ANY YOU DON'T YEAH YOU DON'T
AH OK OKAY
OKAY
AH OK
YEAH EVEN S YEAH
I DIDN'T DISCUSS ANYTHING WITH SUNIL ALSO LIKE I DUNNO TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS ANYTHING
THESE KIND OF THINGS ARE A BIT YEAH
YEAH YEAH
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY LIKE FEELING THAT WHETHER THEY GO FOR ALL THESE NEW FEATURES OR THEY USUALLY USE ONLY MM
MAYBE YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
BUT EVEN THEY DON'T BELIEVE LIKE WITH ONE PAPER OR TWO I GUESS BECAUSE AT LEAST FOR THEM NO P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S
THEY KNOW THAT OKAY THESE THINGS WORK ON EVERY TASK SO OKAY WE CAN PU PUT HANDS ON THESE THINGS YEAH
HUH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
MAYBE LIKE YEAH F BECAUSE SUNIL IS WORKING IN NOKIA HE'S A EXPERT IN KIND OF FEATURES OR YEAH IT L I THINK
BUT YEAH WE'RE NOT SURE EVEN SUNIL WON'T TELL US
NO NO N NO THIS UH COHEN YOU MEAN LIKE UH UH
HMM
OH OK
HUH
UH
BUT THIS WAS SIGNAL COMPANY NO LIKE
THIS VOICE SIGNAL COMPANY HY HYNEK ALWAYS MENTIONS UH COHEN'S COMPANY WITH WHAT THEY'RE USING YOU N YEAH
VOICE NO NO VOICE SIGNAL
THEY MAKE UH RECOGNITION FOR THESE SAMSUNG PHONES AND YEAH
UH THEY HAVE LIKE REALLY S MANY RECOGNISERS I GUESS
MAYBE DEFINITELY THEY MAY BE USING P. L. P. S OR YOU KNOW
YEAH RASTA OR RASTA OR SOMETHING YOU MEAN
MM
YEAH BECAUSE MM
YEAH BUT AGAIN
YEAH TOO NEW IS REALLY DEFINITELY BECAUSE LIKE WANT TO AT LEAST SEE I AT LEAST FOUR
FIVE YEARS OF RESULTS OF SOME NEW FEATURES AND SOME CONSISTENT RESULTS OR
AH
UH SPACE OR AH OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM
YEAH
BUT YEAH D
YEAH UH ANOTHER ISSUE IS LIKE AGAIN THE COMPUTATIONAL ISSUES NO
IF THEY WANT TO MAKE ON MOBILE THEY DON'T WANT REALLY USE SOME FANCY REALLY EXPENSIVE COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE FEATURES OR ALL THESE
YEAH YEAH IT
IT'S JUST PHONE RECOGNITION OR SOMETHING LIKE
YEAH
BUT MOST OF THE TIME MOBILES THEY USE D D. T. W. KIND OF THING NO LIKE
ALL THESE UH SO VOICE CALLING YEAH VOICE CALLING AND THESE THING BECAUSE THAT'S EASY LIKE
BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY NEED TO PUT LOT OF UH MEMORY AND THESE THINGS OTHERWISE IF THEY WANT TO BUILD A REAL
YEAH YEAH YEAH
WHERE WHERE
MM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH COHEN YEAH YEAH
IT'S SAMSUNG SOME SOME NEW REALLY NEW PHONE LIKE MM
YEAH
BUT UH THE SOFTWARE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE OR LIKE
NO THE SOFTWARE IS AGAIN ON TOP OF MOBILE OR LIKE IT COMES WITH YOUR MOBILE
NO THE THING IS USUALLY THESE KIND OF THESE KIND OF FACILITIES ARE LIKE NO NOT NORMAL SO SO THEY MAY CHARGE MORE OR LIKE YEAH YEAH
YEAH
AH OK YEAH DEFINITELY THEY MAY CHARGE FOR MORE MONEY F AGAIN SOME EXTRA BILL FOR THIS USING THIS RECOGNITION ENGINE OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT MAYBE LIKE IF IT CAN'T REALLY RECOGNISE YOU IT WILL BE REALLY ANNOYING IT'S BETTER
YEAH I HAVE USED ONCE LIKE THIS DRAGON THAT WAS KIND OF GOOD LIKE YEAH
BECAUSE EVEN IN WHEN I WAS WORKING IN UH LIKE IN EDINBURGH LIKE ONE GUY
HE USE I HE GOT SOME PROBLEM WITH HANDS AND THEN HE WAS ALWAYS USING THIS N UH DICTATION EVEN HE USED TO WRITE LOT OF C. PLUS PLUS CODE WITH THE DICTATION LIKE
IT'S REALLY GOOD LIKE SO
BUT YOU OUGHT TO REALLY TRAIN AND THEN YOU'RE TO KIND OF UH YEAH
I GET USED TO THE SYSTEM
YEAH YEAH IT'S REALLY LIKE YOU OUGHT TO GET USED TO THE SYSTEM
LIKE YOU HOW TO SAY ALL THE CALLINGS AND THIS THING SYSTEM HOW T BUT IT'S REALLY FUNNY LIKE
HE IS ABLE TO USE IT FOR LIKE LIKE YEARS I MEAN HE USED TO WRITE A LOT OF CODE AND YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY GREAT
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN LISTEN FESTIVAL
READ THE LIKE
MM YEAH
YEAH YEAH FES YEAH I THINK I THINK YOU CAN DO THE FESTIVAL YOU CAN JUST CALL LIKE UH THIS THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF AGAIN
HOW YOU CALL THE FESTIVAL SO YOU CAN JUST GIVE THE FULL THERE IS AN TOO
SO THEN YOU WILL GET THE ALL THE CALLER AND OTHER THINGS
IF IF YOU WANT TO LIKE READ FULL TEXT THEN YOU CAN SAY LIKE THE FULL TEXT
LIKE THOSE SYNTAX AND THEN IT WILL SPEAK TILL IT FINISHES THE TEXT
YEAH IT'S REAL IT'S YEAH
DIPHONE YEAH YEAH
THAT'S WHY IT'S REAL TIME LIKE OTHERWISE IT'S BIT DIFFICULT AND IT'S OKAY YOU CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND SO IT'S INTELLIGIBLE SO
UH FESTIVAL IS GOOD LIKE NOW IT COMES AT ALL THE LINUX BOXES ALSO SO IN SO ALREADY IN THIS
NO THE THERE ARE SO MANY VOICES LIKE AGAIN
WHICH VOICE YOU WANT TO USE
NO MOST OF THE THE FESTIVAL UH WHAT YOU GET ON LINUX MACHINES IS DIPHONE BASED ONLY
SO THEY SUPPLY FEW VOICES
YEAH YEAH YEAH JUST UH CONCATENATION OF THE NO IT'S ALREADY THERE IF YOU JUST PUT LI FESTIVAL
IT COMES WI BECAUSE IT'S COMES WITH DIRECT LINUX SOFTWARE AND YOU KNOW IT IS OPEN SOURCE
FESTIVAL IS OPEN
IT'S
YEAH CAT VOICE LIKE THERE ARE LIKE THEY THEY HAVE FEW
YEAH NEW VOICES LIKE YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THAT THA IN VIEWS THIS UNIT SELECTION
IT'S NOT DIPHONES YOU HAVE REALLY LARGE INVENTORY OF THE SPEECH
UH THOSE VOICES THEY'RE NOT YET RELEASED
YEAH
NO NO IT'S FREE THEY'LL BE RELEASING SOON I GUESS
SO MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CHECK NO I IT'S IT'S HERE ON THE WEB THEN IT WON'T COME WITH YOUR LINUX SOFTWARE
SO YOU HAVE TO AGAIN DOWNLOAD FROM UH THEIR WEB PAGE
YEAH YOU CAN DOWNLOAD NOW
YEAH YEAH YEAH
IT THE VOICES ARE CALLED MULTISYN MULTISYN UH SL UH THAT'S SOME VOICE
SO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FROM THE VOICE FROM THE WEB FESTIVAL
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO VOICE IS LIKE THE DATABASE OF THE PARALLEL SPEAKER WHO SPEAKS THAT THIS TEXT SO
IT WAS REALLY LARGE DATABASE SO IT THE VOI THE QUALITY WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND SIMILAR YEAH
IT'S MORE OR LESS BUT NOT EXACTLY LIKE UH IT'S TWO TIMES OR ONE POINT FIVE TIMES OR SOMETHING
BUT YOU CAN PRUNE LIKE HOW MUCH YOU WANT BECAUSE
SO THIS IS AGAIN LIKE UH THAT'S KIND OF MY P. H. D. WORK HOW IN THIS SYSTEM LIKE HOW YOU CHOOSE THE UNITS AND HOW YOU CONCATENATE
SO THERE ARE AGAIN COST FUNCTIONS AND VITERBI
SO YOU CAN YOU CAN ALWAYS OPTIMISE YOU CAN PUT SOME THRESHOLDS AND PRUNING AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE IT REAL TIME
SO THEN AGAIN COMPROMISE UH BETWEEN THE QUALITY AND YEAH
BUT STILL IT'S GOOD LIKE NOW
TH YOU CAN JUST CHECK MULTISYN AND THEN VOICES
UH YEAH YEAH IT'S REALLY GOOD
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT ONLY SOMETIMES LIKE IT CAN'T REALLY CALL THIS YEAH
UH STANDARD TEXT
YEAH
YEAH ASCII FILE IS
ASCII AND BUT ONLY THE PROBLEM'S AGAIN ACRONYMS AND SOMETIMES IT EXPANDS SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT EXPAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THEIR DICTIONARY SO YEAH
IT'S NOT IN THE DICTIONARY LIKE IF WE AGAIN IT'S PROBLEM LIKE SO
BUT THOSE THINGS YOU CAN ADD LIKE IF YOU'RE REALLY FAMILIAR WITH FESTIVAL SO YOU CAN ADD ALWAYS THESE
YEAH
BUT AT LEAST THESE THINGS OKAY LIKE IT WON'T REALLY MAKE MISTAKES SO OFTEN LIKE SOMETIMES
ALAN BLACK AND PAUL TAYLOR THEY STARTED R FESTIVAL IN NINETY SIX OR SOMETHING
EDINBURGH C. S. T. R. YEAH
UH F OH UH THIS MA THIS JOHANN WATERS OR LIKE NO THEY D WHAT THEY DID PORTLAND O. G. I. THEY DID L. P. C. BASED SYNTHESIS
THE FESTIVAL IS ALREA ALREADY LIKE IT'S ONE FIRST YOU START WITH TH
AH OKAY
MM
FROM
I DON'T KNOW
NO NO ACTUALLY THE B
AH OKAY OKAY
YEAH MAYBE BECAUSE
AH OK
HMM
YEAH FIRST THEY STARTED IN C. S. T. R. WITH ALAN BLACK AND PAUL TAYLOR THEN THEN IT EXPAND TO MANY PLACES
BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS FIL NO SIMON KING IS HE'S ONE OF THE OTHERS BUT ROB CLARK IS THE MAN THAT YOU MET UM
UH UH ALREADY
YEAH
IT'S
SO ANYTHING UH MORE ABOUT LISBON OR INTERSPEECH
I IT'S ENOUGH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO YOU START I THINK RIGHT
YEAH SO WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PAPERS FROM INTERSPEECH
THIS IS NOT A GOOD QUESTION I THINK
ALL OF THEM OF COURSE
ALL OF THEM OF COURSE
OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
OKAY
BAD ANSWER RIGHT
LIKE
YEAH I IT'S NOT EVERY YEAR RIGHT
YEAH WE MET IN ALSO IN I. C. S. L. P. RIGHT
THE FIRST TIME SO
YEAH
SO HOW HOW DID YOU LIKE THE CONFERENCE ANYWAY
WHEN IN COMPARED TO TO TH THE OTHERS THE PREVIOUS ONE
BUT
YEAH
RIGHT
OH YEAH
HE WAS FROM AUSTRALIA RIGHT
THE GUY YEAH
UH HE'S VERY FAMOUS I THINK FOR THAT RIGHT
HE'S THE THE INVENTOR OF THAT IMPLANT AND FOR FOR THE EAR I THINK
S YEAH
MM
SO YOU WENT TO A BEACH
TO A LIKE ATLANTIC SEA COAST OR YEAH
UH-HUH
UH IT'S NOT SO FAR FROM LISBON HALF AN HOUR MM-HMM
UH NORTHWEST MM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT I THINK LISBON THOSE DAYS ARE PRETTY GOOD LIKE SEEM TO ME QUITE NOT COLD BUT STILL OKAY LIKE REASONABLE
OH YEAH
YEAH I WAS HAPPY TO BE BACK IN SUISSE AFTER FEW FEW DAYS IT'S BETTER TO BE HERE I THINK
YEAH IT'S BIG CITY MANY PEOPLE AND
YEAH YEAH
THOSE NEW ONLY RIGHT
NOT THE OLD ONE BUT YEAH
YEAH
AH IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE IT MAYBE
SOME TIME YES BUT NOT SO MANY DAYS OR
OH YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
CONFERENCE
YEAH YEAH
IT'S
BETTER TO TA
YEAH
THE EASIEST WAY
I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME
IS IT THERE
YEAH I IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE
OH YOU'VE GOT THE S
YEAH
UH-HUH
LIKE
NO I DON
RIGHT MM-HMM
YEAH
SO THEY OBTAIN BETTER RESULTS WITH THAT FINALLY OR
BUT
RIGHT
BUT IF YOU COMPARE NO IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH SOME BASELINE LET'S SAY YOU USE JUST G. M. M. WITH DIAGONAL COVARIANCE MATRICES
A AND NO DECORRELATION BEFORE LIKE UH
YEAH
OR L. D. A. IS THERE OR
YEAH
BUT BUT THERE MUST BE THE SENSE RIGHT
BECAUSE ONCE YOU DECORRELATE THE DATA THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE FULL I KNOW
THAT'S SO THAT'S THAT MEANS THAT THE DECORRELATION IS NOT UH OPTIMAL RIGHT
SO SO THAT'S THE REASON
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
IT IS YEAH
UH NO THERE THERE IS NOT
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR LIKE L. V. C. ASIDE IMPOSSIBLE TO USE IT RIGHT
YOU'VE GOT DIMENSION THIRTY NINE TIMES THIRTY NINE
YEAH
SO YEAH
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO USE IT
AND YOU CANNOT EVEN TRAIN IT RIGHT
MORE OR LESS I THINK
OH SO THAT'S INTERESTING
MM-HMM
MUCH LONGER
SHORTER YEAH
RIGHT
WH WHAT IS THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM
SO IT'S NOT SO MM
TWO POINT FIVE MILLISECONDS
TWENTY MILLISECONDS
FROM
OH YEAH
RIGHT
SURE
AND THE SHIFTING IS STILL THE SAME OR NOT
O YEAH YEAH OVERLAP
SO
LIKE UM NO HOW MANY FRAMES PER PER SECOND YOU DO HAVE
IS IT AGAIN LIKE UH ONE HUNDRED FRAMES OR IT'S LESS OR EVEN IF YOU KEEP VARIABLE LENGTH OF THE FRAMES RIGHT
YOU CAN STILL KEEP THE SAME FRAME RATE
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THIS WOULD HAVE SENSE FOR I DON'T KNOW SPEECH CODING WHERE YOU WANT TO PRESERVE UH OR YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT INTO LESS FRAMES
RIGHT BUT WHY DO WHY TO DO IT FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
IT MEANS THAT UH
YEAH NO WHA WHY TO KEEP VARIABL VARIABILITY IN THE LENGTH OF THE FRAMES
WH WHY NOT TO KEEP THE SAME LENGTH WHAT IS THE
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
MM-HMM
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RI RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RIGHT YES
RIGHT YEAH
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
WELL
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH PROBABLY
NO I DON'T THINK SO
THERE IS NO INFORMATION
HMM
YEAH YEAH YEAH RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT
MM MM-HMM PROBABLY
WHO KNOWS MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE TO USE IT SOMEHOW BUT THEN THERE IS UH INFORMATION ABOUT TEMPORAL INFORMATION IS SOMEHOW INCLUDED IN SUCH YEAH
YEAH
THERE IS ALSO SOME UM LIKE UH NOT PAPER
BUT I SAW THE ALGORITHM I HAVE BEEN USING EVEN THAT CALLED TEMPORAL DECOMPOSITION I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KN YOU KNOW THAT LIKE
UH I DON'T KNOW WHO PROPOSE IT I JUST HAD IT FROM FROM BEAMBOT FOR LIKE A BEAMBOT DO YOU KNOW THE GUY
HE'S FRENCH UM SOMEWHERE NOW IN TELECONFERENCE LIKE MM I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S WORKING BUT TH WE WERE USING IT FOR UH SPEECH CODING
SO WE JUST HAD A SPEECH AND YOU HAD DECOMPOSE A SPEECH INTO SUCH SEGMENTS TEMPORAL SEGMENTS WHICH WERE STATIONARY INSIDE
AND THEN YOU CAN MORE OR LESS UH QUANTISE THOSE SEGMENTS SOMEHOW AND USE IT FOR ENCODING LET'S SAY OR AND IT WORKED PRETT YEAH YEAH
THEY WERE USING LIKE S. V. D. STUFF SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION FOR THAT AND IT WORKED PRETTY WELL LIKE I WAS SURPRISED LIKE
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY UH HE WAS USING THAT
YEAH
OH WELL IT'S IT HAS BEEN USED FOR SPEECH CODING
NOB NOBODY USE IT FOR RECOGNITION STUFF I THINK I NEVER HEARD THAT
NO I DON'T OF COURSE
YEAH THAT'S GOOD QUESTION
MAYBE
RIGHT
RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S IMPORTANT
ALL THE PAPERS
OKAY
I THINK PEOPLE WOULDN'T LIKE IT
MANY PEOPLE WOULDN'T LIKE IT
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH YEAH SURE
EXACTLY
RIGHT
AND EVERYBODY'S UH LIKE UH USING DIFFERENT TRAINING AND TESTING DATA AND THEN YOU DON'T KNOW IF LIKE
THEY SHOW IT WORKS FOR TIMIT BUT THEN YOU TRY TO USE SOME DIFFERENT DATABASES YOU SEE IT DOESN'T WORK
YEAH SURE
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH YEAH YEAH
NIST EVALUATIONS
YEAH BUT NOBODY YOU KNOW IT'S THOSE NEW SYSTEMS ARE STILL NOT GENERAL LIKE YOU KNOW
LIKE THOSE P. L. P. AND M. F. C. C. S BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT DI IT WORKED SOMEHOW RIGHT FOR ANY KIND OF DATA
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE COMPARING TO TO THAT SO
ONCE SOMEBODY WILL COME WITH SOMETHING NEW OKAY HE HE'S SHOWING IT WORKS FOR SOME DATAS BUT STILL YEAH YEAH
FIRST IT'S DIFFICULT TO TO SHOW THAT IT WORKS FOR ALL ALL THE DATAS RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY AND
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S YOUR CHOICE
MM-HMM
NO NO I JUST FOR
YEAH
I THINK SO YEAH PROBABLY MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
RI I
IT'S JUST T. T. S. RIGHT TEXT TO SPEECH
RIGHT
MM-HMM
RIGHT RIGHT
ARE THEY
FOR O. G. I. S
FOR O. G. I. NUMBERS
DIFFERENT SETUPS
LIKE SOME PEOPLE USE THIS SETUP AND SOME PEOPLE THAT
UH-HUH
SO YOU JUST
OH YEAH
NO UH IT'S
I DUNNO I I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THAT AND
RIGHT YEAH YEAH
FOR NOISE CONDITIONS YEAH IT'S PRETTY GOOD
WELL TH THOSE F RECOGNISERS ARE ARE MADE THERE OR JUST YOU JUST USE THEM THAT'S IT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT
SHE EVEN IS F IT WAS FORBIDDEN IN THE TIME RIGHT SO YOU HAVE RECOGNISER JUST USE IT
DON'T PLAY WITH IT YOU JUST PLAY WITH THE FEATURES
YEAH RIGHT EXACTLY
SO
YEAH YEAH
RI RIGHT
YEAH YEAH I REMEMBER
WITH DAVID PEARCE HE WAS
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY
WE ARE USING THOSE RESULTS MORE OR LESS
BUT NOT EVERYBODY GO
NOT EVERYBODY
MANY PEOPLE STAY SO
YEAH
YEAH SURE
BUT EXACTLY
NO
WELL MANY PEOPLE PLACE WITH TANDEM RIGHT LIKE M. I. T. OR WHO IS USING THAT SOME NOT M. I. T. BUT SOMEBODY
I DUNNO HYNEK TOLD TOLD US THAT SOMEBODY'S USING THAT UM VERY ACTIVELY LIKE OKAY
IT IT WORKS FOR THEM AND AND THEY ARE CLOSE TO LIKE INDUSTRY LIKE UH YOU KNOW
THERE IS IT'S A RESEARCH GROUP OF I KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S ICSI
SOMEBODY ELSE OR I DON'T KNOW SOMEBODY NEW UH S BUT I THINK SOME T SOMEBODY LIKE A. T. AND A. T. AND T. OR WHAT
OH QU YEAH
YOU ME I DON'T KNOW HE'S EVEN IF QUALCOMM
NO
NOW Y OH YEAH YEAH
FOR RIGHT RIGHT
NO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH DEFINITELY
MAYBE THEY ARE USING P. L. P. S AND BUT I TH I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS STILL SOME STUFF UP TO YEAH
FOR RASTA OR WHATEVER ELSE LIKE ALL THOSE DECORRELATIONS AND TRANSFORMATIONS
I THINK IT'S THERE BUT MORE OR LESS IT'S AGAIN BASED ON M. F. C. C. S OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OR MAYBE TRAPS
NO MORE OR LESS I THINK YEAH
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE IT'S TRUE
BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT SITUATION BECAUSE RIGHT
THEY NEED THAT IT DOESN'T CREATE THAT MUCH YEAH
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH THE MACHINE AND UH I DON'T KN THE ALLOC SYSTEM IT DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT
SOMEBODY WILL FIX IT AND CHANGE IT BUT
SURE
YEAH
EVEN EVEN NOT VITERBI JUST EVEN SOMETHING SIMPLER
YEAH
UH I DON'T KNOW
DO YOU THINK SO
YEAH
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH SURE
YEAH
EVEN ON THE PHONE
N SOME NEW ONE OR
FROM THAT C COHEN'S
OH UH-HUH
AND BUT WHICH UH PHONE IT IS
F SAMSUNG SOMETHING
WHERE UH SOME BUT SOME WHICH YOU CAN BUY RIGHT
IT'S
IT AND YOU CAN TRAIN IT LIKE ONLY YOUR SPEECH OR IT'S GENERAL UH IT'S QUITE INTERESTING YEAH
OKAY UH-HUH
OR YOU YOU CAN JUST BUY THAT APPLICATION RIGHT
I DON'T KNOW LIKE IT'S LIKE YOU YOU'VE GOT SOME MOBILE PHONE
AND THEN YOU CAN BUY FROM ANOTHER COMPANY SOME SUCH APPLICATION WH YOU CAN DICTATE YOUR S. M. S. OR WHATEVER
S I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS DONE NOW BUT LIKE
BUT HAVE YOU EVER USED LIKE DICTATION SYSTEM FOR WINDOWS
THOSE UH THERE WERE MANY OF THEM
YEAH DRAG THE MOUSE THERE
AND I HEARD THAT IT WORKED VERY VERY WELL
UM
ALRIGHT
RIGHT NEWER SPEECH OKAY
OKAY
HOW TO SAY OKAY
MM-HMM
I THINK YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY
IT'S BASED ON THE DIPHONES DIPHONES RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD YEAH
MM-HMM
SO YOU'VE GOT IT INSTALLED IN YOUR MACHINE HERE OR
FESTIVAL RIGHT
OKAY
OH
A AND HAVE YOU HAVE YOU TRIED IT
AND
SO YOU CAN
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND
YEAH YEAH
AND YOU JUST UH HAVE CHOSEN SOME TEXT
ANY TEXT YOU JUST PUT IN AND
OKAY
AND IT CAN READ UH HOW DOES IT READ FROM WHICH UM FROM WHICH UH HOW TO STATE IT
UH IS IT UH POSSIBLE TO READ P. D. F. S OR JUST STANDARD TEXT
WHATEVER T. X. T. RIGHT FILES
UH-HUH

WELL LET'S
OH REALLY
ANYWAY WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF FESTIVAL
EDINBURGH

YEAH BUT THERE WAS
NO NO BUT THAT THAT WAS THE GUY WHO'S ON A WHEELCHAIR NOW
HE CANNOT M MOVE EVEN HE'S VERY IN LIKE INDIC HOW TO SAY THAT
LIKE HE CANNOT HAVE HE JUST CAN SPEAK ONLY THROUGH SOME FESTIVAL SYSTEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HE WAS THE AUTH NO YEAH H HE WAS WORKING I THINK IN W O. G. I. EVEN
HE'S VERY FAMOUS BUT I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS THE AUTHOR NO
IT WAS DEVELOPED FOR HIM LIKE HE WAS JUST FIRST TESTER I THINK OF THE SYSTEM
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
LIKE IT'S NOT T TEXT TO SPEECH IT'S JUST THE UH UH SYNTHESIS WHICH MEANS WHICH IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME BUT I DUNNO
YEAH
SO IT'S SOMEBODY AND SIMON KING IS PLAYING WITH THAT RIGHT THE T GUY
OKAY OKAY
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH
NO OTHER PAPERS IT'S JUST ONE PAPER AND AND FESTIVAL
FROM LINUX IT'S VERY IM INTERESTING
YEAH
AND IT'S ALWAYS THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT'S HOW YOU PUT IT ON
I THINK THE THE MOST OF THE BAD WORDS ARE AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE PEOPLE TRY TO PUT IN ON
HUH
WHOO
AH I CANNOT PUT IT
OH NO NO NOT AT ALL
WELL GENEVA THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AT IDIAP BECAUSE I ATTENDED GENEVA EUROSPEECH
I C
WHY WHY YOU CANNOT
MM-HMM
EXACTLY
MEET
OKAY SO YOU ATTENDED MOSTLY POSTERS I GUESS
SO HOW MANY PRESENTATION YOU YOU
I REALISED IT WERE THAT THERE WERE PANEL DISCUSSIONS ONLY AT THE PLACE WHERE I COULD SEE THE THE T T YOU KNOW
THERE WERE SOME BOARDS SAYING THAT THERE IS SOME PANEL DISCUSSION
UH BUT I I COULDN'T GET NO ONE KNEW WHERE IS IT WHAT IT IS WHERE IT HAPPENS AND WHY AND SO FORTH
IT WAS COM
YEAH
FINALLY I FOUND BUT
WELL THIS IS NOT THIS SPEECH IS NOT RESTRICTED ONLY TO PAPERS AND THESE THINGS YOU KNOW
SO HOW DID YOU LIKE LISBON THEN
YEAH
YEAH W WE WENT TO THE COSTA CAPARICA THERE WITH THE BUS
WE WE WERE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE TAKE THE DIRECT ONE BUT WE DIDN'T
NORTH
OKAY SO YOU STAYED AT THE AT THE SAME COAST NOT NOT YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE ISLAND
CROSS THE RIVER WHERE WHERE IS THE BRIDGE AND AND THEN OKAY SO THAT WAS A DIFFERENT PLACE
YEAH WITH HAMED UH HEMANT AND THESE PEOPLE
THE MORE SOUTH TO TH THE HOLE THROUGH THE WATER
HUH
I WAS
I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT EVEN THE TRAMS DID HAVE A A. C. THERE
I COULDN'T SEE IT AT AT ALL
YEAH R RIGHT BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE IN
UH IT'S A. C.
WELL
IT IT WAS MUCH BETTER IF IF IF YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A HOUR AND A HALF THAT UH HEMANT AND THE OTHERS SPENT WHILE GOING WITH A CA UH WITH A BUS TO TO THE CONFERENCE CENTRE FROM FROM THE THE HOTEL THAT WE WERE
THERE WAS A DIRECT BUS AND IT TOOK THEM HOUR AND A HALF THEN
MM
YEAH
YEAH THAT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE BUT TO TAKE SOMETHING WHICH WHICH WAS UH DIRECT IN QUOTES
IT WAS N NOT THE F DIRECT AS ANYTHING ELSE BUT
UH IT SOUNDS SOUNDS LIKE
LET'S GO ON THIS WAS JUST A
OF WHAT
PRUNING OF COVARIANCE MATRIX
BUT WHAT WHAT DOES IT MEAN TIED THEN
UH YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO STORE THE WHOLE MATRIX AND PLUS SOME EXTRA INFORMATION WHAT IS TIED TO WHAT OR B
YEAH BUT
UH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT
TYING
MM
BUT OOH THE THE MAIN POINT IS TO TO UH LIKE MAKE IT FASTER THE THE THE DECODING OR WHAT
WELL THAT'S POSSIBLE WHY WHY IT SHOULD BE I IMPOSSIBLE
SO IT'S COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT WITH FULL COVARIANCE MATRIX
WHY
YEAH COMPUTATIONALLY E EXPENSIVE BUT
OF COURSE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF COMPUTATION BUT OTHERWISE IT'S THERE'S NO PROBLEM NO
WITH OKAY
OKAY SO SO HERE YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE EITHER MANY MANY THINGS TO STORE AND HUGE COMPUTATION UH
YEAH YEAH
NO
UH DEPENDS
SO
SO THERE ARE NO RESULTS THERE
NO
HMM YEAH
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
WHY IT HAS TO BE ONLINE
OKAY
LIKE EXTENDED AS AS MORE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE OKAY
OF COURSE OF COURSE
WHOO
YEAH IT'S RIGHT
THIS IS MAYBE BECAUSE OF F. F. T. U. OR THESE THINGS
IT'S NO NOT AS SMALL AS AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT MAYB MAYBE BECAUSE OF OTHER PROCESSING AFTER
NO
YEAH
WELL NOISY YES
OVERLAP YOU MEAN
UH W HOW DO YOU MEAN TO SAY
UH
UM I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FIRST IS ESSENTIALLY HOW HE'S DOING IN THAT
NO WELL UH ONCE HE GETS THE FRAME LIKE FROM HERE TO HERE THEN WHERE HE ADVANCES TO TO START WITH C COMPUTATION OF THE NEXT FRAME
YEAH MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
FU OK OKAY SO DO WHAT DO YOU MEAN FULL
SOME SOME SUB WINDOW OR THE THE WHOLE TEN SECONDS OF SPEECH OR WHAT
IT HAS TO BE ALSO SOME SOMEHOW
OKAY SOMETHING LONGER WINDOW THAN THE ONE WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT OKAY
UH W
OKAY SO YOU HAVE A WINDOW AND THEN YOU SPLIT IT TO S TWO PARTS AND YOU SHIFT THE THE POINT WHERE YOU SPLIT IT OR OKAY
OKAY SPLITTING POINT OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO BASICALLY WE HAVE TWO FIXED POINTS
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO ONCE YOU HAVE SAY ONE HOUR OF SPEECH YOU START AT THE BEGINNING AND FIRST YOU TRY WITH TWENTY MILLISECONDS
THEN YOU SHIFT TO TWENTY FIVE AND SO FORTH UNTIL YOU
OKAY AND AND YOU FIND THE POINT WHERE WHERE WHAT
WHERE WHERE DO YOU STOP ACTUALLY
YEAH MM I KNOW BUT YOU START AT TWENTY AND GO TO SIXTY BUT WHERE WHICH POINT DO YOU CHOOSE
UH OKAY BUT WHICH WHICH LIKELIHOOD RATIO
OKAY
YEAH BUT UH LIKELIHOOD THAT'S SOMETHING AND SOMETHING
W WHAT IS LIKELIHOOD
OKAY
YEAH BUT IT HAS TO YEAH
OKAY
SO IT'S BASIC
SO
MM
YEAH
YEAH BUT STILL
IF
MM
YEAH BUT WHY DO THE MAIN VALUE WHICH ARE COMPARING TO
THE THE THE OVERALL VALUE OR OVERALL LIKELIHOOD OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT WHY HE'S USING THE WHOLE SIGNAL FOR THIS
BECAUSE SO IF THE WHOLE SIGNAL WAS UH STEADY SOMEHOW AND IT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE MODELLED BY L. P. MODEL
WELL THEN THE RESIDUE WILL BE VERY LOW
SO HE'S SUPPOSING THAT THE WHOLE SIGNAL WON'T BE ABLE TO TO BE CAPTURED BY L. P. MODEL AND THAT THE RESIDUE WOULD BE HIGH ENOUGH OR HO WH WHY HE'S COMPARING THE O TO TO THE OVERALL
YOU KNOW I I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF DIVIDING OVER THE THE WHOLE STUFF
Y WELL SOUNDS SOUNDS REASONABLE
I SEE I SEE I SEE
OKAY THAT'S REASONABLE
BECAUSE ACTUALLY IF IT IF IF UH THE WHOLE SIGNAL WOULD BE ABLE TO BE MODELLED BY L. UH BY L. P. C. THEN ANYWAY HE HAS TO DESIGN SOME SOME FRAMING
SO EVEN IF IT'S VERY STATIONARY BY D UM BY DIVIDING OVER THIS WHOLE STUFF HE IS ABLE TO FIND SOME REASONABLE BOUNDARIES
UM M MA MAKES SENSE UM
OKAY
AND
MM
THAT HAS TO BE POWER NOT ENERGY DEFINITELY NO
YEAH BUT IT HAS TO BE NORMALISED
BY THE LENGTH
THEN POWER INSTEAD OF ENERGY
ENERGY OVER LENGTH IS POWER
YEAH YEAH
DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH
OKAY
SO BUT THIS SO TWO THINGS I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
THI THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONLY FOR M. F. C. C. S AND THESE EASY FEATURES AH ONE QUESTION I I WANTED TO ASK BEFORE
DOES DOES HE PRESERVE WITHIN THE FEATURE VECTOR THE FRAMING HE'S USING FINALLY
BECAUSE DOES HE SOMEHOW PUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT WAS THE SIZE ABOUT THE FRAME TO THE FEATURE VECTOR ITSELF OR HE'S THROWING AWAY THIS FRAMING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE RECOGNISER COULD BE GOOD FOR THE RECOGNISER TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE CHOSEN FRAMING BY THIS EXTRACTION
OKAY
SO SO IT N UH IT MIGHT BE BAD FOR THEN FOR THE BACK END IT MIGHT SCREW UP THE THE T SPEECH RATE OR NORMALISER
HUH
OH PROBABLY I DIDN'T GET IT TOO SO THE FRAMING IS ACTUALLY EQUI DISTANT
JUST THE WINDOWS ARE WIDER OH AH I SEE
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE CRAZY YEAH A LITTLE BIT
OH I SEE SO SO IT'S IT'S LIKE THIS
YEAH
I CANNOT IMAGINE THE TRANSFORMATION TO GET THE MODULATION SPECTRUM OUT OF SUCH A STUFF
UH
MM
SO WHY DON'T YOU STILL USE IT
IF IT WORKS SO WELL
YEAH BUT YOU DO THE SPEECH CODING SO DO YOU STILL USE IT
WHY
MM
UH
UH IT'S INTERESTING THIS
WELL THERE SHOULD BE AFTER EACH CONFERENCE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE TEN PEOPLE SHOULD SIT DOWN READ THE PAPERS AND THEN RANK THEM
YOU KNOW A ALL THE ALL THE ALL THE SIMILAR PAPERS WITHIN ONE SESSION SAY SP UH FOCUS TO THIS TOPIC
AND SAY THIS IS THE BEST THIS WORKS SLIGHTLY WORSE THAN THIS ONE
AND THROW AWAY WHAT IS NOT THAT GOOD AND AND TH THE FIRST THREE THREE PAPERS WHICH ARE THE BEST SHOU SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND USED FROM FROM THAT TIME ONWARDS
LIKE FORGET THE ALL THE M. F. C. C. S BECAUSE IT'S TOO OLD AND THEN START BUILDING THE STORY ON THE NEW STUFF AND NOT 'CAUSE IT'S
YEAH IT IS BUT I KNOW I KNOW UH TH THIS IS JUST A THEORY
BECAUSE
MM YEAH
YES AND I WANT TO YEAH
YEAH
IT LOOKS LIKE
MM
YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE TO ME IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE IS STILL COMPARING TO P. L. P. S OR M. F. C. C. S
AND THERE ARE SO MANY NEW SYSTEMS AND EVERYTHING IS NEW BUT IT BASELINE IS STILL UH T TWENTY YEARS OLD AND
YEAH
UH YEAH
NO OKAY SO
SO IT SHOULD BE EVERY PAPERS THEN SHOULD CONTAIN ALL THE RESULTS FROM NIST EVALUATION OR SOME STANDARD TASK THEN
OTHERWISE
UH UH THAT'S THE OTHER YEAH
OKAY SO IT COULD BE YOU YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUBLISH THE RESULTS ON THIS STANDARD TASK
AND THEN YOU COULD SAY WELL I ALSO TRIED ON THIS AND THIS
YEAH
YOU KNOW BUT THEN THEN ONLY IT MAKES SOME PROGRESS THIS
MM
YEAH BUT CAN FOR FOR EXAMPLE CAN YOU USE FROM SOME DATA FROM FROM THE L. T. WORLD
FOR TRAINING SAY
YEAH BUT THEY GIVE YOU ALSO TRAINING DATA OR ONLY THE TESTING DATA
OH I UH SINCE THIS IS ONLY OKAY
OKAY SO SO THEY GIVE YOU ONLY THE TRAINING OR DEVELOPMENT DATA ONLY
MM-HMM
YEAH
HMM
MM
HMM
MM-HMM
MM
UH
AL ALMOST
YEAH
WE ARE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AT IDIAP AND THERE ARE ALREADY TWO S TWO DIFFERENT SETUPS
STORIES AND NUMBERS OR
YEAH
UH I THINK WE USE DI DISTINCT TRAIN AND TEST SET EVEN SE THE DIFFERENT SETS OF PHONEMES
DIFFERENT
WELL I DON'T USE ONLY DIGITS
MY M. L. P. S ARE TRAINED ON EVERYTHING AND UH TEST SET IS DIGITS YEAH
FOR FOR WHAT
AH
YEAH
YEAH YOU CANNOT PLAY WITH THAT
BECAUSE OF THE VOICES WOULDN'T BE COMPARABLE THEN
UH
HMM
BECAUSE WHO IS THE ONE WHO MAKES WHO ACTUALLY USES WHAT WE D TRY TO DO HERE
THESE ARE COMPANIES OR BECAUSE IT'S NOT SCIENTISTS SCIENTISTS JUST START FROM P. L. P. AND THEN DESIGN THE NEW FEATURES
NEW BACK END OR NEW ANYTHING BUT THEY START FROM THE OLD STUFF
BUT WHO IS THE ONE WHO IS USING THESE RESULTS WHICH WE PUBLISH AND TRY TO MAKE
YEAH BUT ONCE YOU ONCE YOU FINISH YOUR P. H. D. YOU GO AND IT'S OVER
AND THOSE WHO DON'T
THEY STAY AND PUBLISH ANOTHER PAPERS AND THEY BUT THEY THEY DON'T TURN INTO A LIFE NO
INTO LIFE
MM UH-HUH
BECAUSE
I I WON
YES
I WONDER WHICH LEVEL THEY ARE USING OUT OF WHAT IS THERE
HMM
YEAH
THEY GRAB
HMM
HMM
OKAY SO WE CAN HOPE THAT NOKIA WILL BE USING TANDEM TANDEM P. L. P. S
YEAH I CANNOT
HUH
SO IT'S NOT RELATED TO ICSI
YEAH BUT IT WAS
MM
HMM
HMM
HMM
BECAUSE THEY GRAB WHATEVER IS CERTAIN TO WORK AND THEY THEY USE IT
THEY DON'T USE ANYTHING WHICH IS TO UH TOO NEW WHICH IS NOT THAT SAFE
IT'S LIKE A IT'S LIKE A NASA YOU KNOW THEY USE FOUR EIGHT FOUR EIGHT SIX
MACHINES TO TO TO TO PUT TWO N UH SPACE SHIPS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S KNOWN TO WORK PERFECTLY WELL OR PENTIUM
NOT ANY P. FOUR OR WHATEVER BECAUSE IT'S SAFE IT HAS BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY YEARS
AND THEN ONLY IT SAFE TO PUT WELL NOT TWENTY BUT IT'S ALWAYS YEAH YEAH OF COURSE
OF COURSE
MM YEAH
MM
HYNEK ALSO TOLD ABOUT THIS COHEN CE CELL PHONE WHICH HE WAS SHOWING TO TO WORK L UH WITH THE L. V. C. S. R.
HE HE WAS SAYING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY REALLY UH SIMPLE THE DECODER I MEAN NOT THE FEATURES BUT HE WAS MENTIONING SOMETHING TO THE DECODER
THIS IS JUST THERE IS ALMO
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE NO D. T. W. OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT REALLY SURE BUT HE MENTION THAT
HMM
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE
YEAH BUT IT'S THAT'S A SIMILAR ONE TO WHAT HERVE HAS FOR EXAMPLE SOME HE WAS SHOWING IT UH LIVE ON M. L. M. I. C LAST M. L. M. I. CONFERENCE
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE VIDEO AND PLAY IT UH
IT UH I'M NOT SURE
YES COMMERCIAL PHONE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALWAYS
WELL THEY THEY JUST BOUGHT A MOBILE AND BASED ON THE O. S. IT'S USING THEY THEY THEY DEVELOPED THE SOFTWARE
NO THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT PHONE THIS IS NOT THE COMMERCIAL STUFF WITH THE SOFTWARE
THEY JUST USE THE DEVICE
BY BY WHAT
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ALREADY THE CASE RIGHT NOW
YOU HAD TO GET USED TO THE SYSTEM NOT THE SYSTEM TO YOU
IT'S NICE
BY THE WAY
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TO ASK IS THERE ANYTHING IF I'M JUST A P PRIVATE PERSON AND I WANT FOR FREE ANY SOFTWARE WHICH IS ABLE TO READ ME A BOOK IN ENGLISH
UH FOR EXAMPLE THAT FESTIVAL AM I ABLE TO PUT THE TEXT TO THE SYSTEM AND TO IN REAL TIME TO LISTEN TO THE OUTPUT
FESTIVAL IS ABLE TO TO TO READ JUST A MM NORMAL PLAIN TEXT IN REASONABLE COMPREHENSIBLE ENGLISH OR SO THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND IT
NON NATIVE SPEAKER
MM OKAY
YEAH
AND IT'S IN REAL TIME ON A REASONABLE MACHINE
OKAY
OKAY
'CAUSE THE THE DIPHONE THAT I WAS TRIED TO INSTALL IT AND THERE THERE ARE THE VOICES LIKE CAT VOICE AND THESE VOICES THIS IS NOT THE ONE
BECAUSE UH I DON'T KNOW WHICH WHICH UM WHAT I WHAT IS RUNNING WHERE UH IF IT'S DIPHONE OR WHICH UH APPROACH THIS IS
YES
SO IT'S UH JUST UH WHA SAMPLES OF THE DIPHONES AND IT CHOO CHOOSES
YEAH ON MY ON MY LAPTOP
OR HERE
YEAH YOU CAN YOU CAN EASILY YES I D I'VE TRIED
BUT THERE ARE SOME BUILT IN LIKE EASY VOICES WHICH YOU CAN Y UH THERE IS A DEFAULT ONE COMPLETELY SYNTHETIC
WHICH YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL
AND TH THEN THERE IS A DIPHONE SYNTHESIS I THINK IT IS THE DIPHONE SYNTHESIS FROM THE SOME LIKE SOMETHING LIKE CAT W VOICE AND SOMETHI THIS IS SO SO
BUT IT'S THIS DOESN'T SOUND VERY NICE AND WE WERE PLAYING AT THE UH SUMMER SCHOOL WITH THEM ACTUALLY WITH THE AUTHORS
AND THEY WERE PLAYING US SOME OTHER OTHER APPROACHES AND IT IT SOUNDED LIKE A HUMAN IT WAS GREAT BUT
YEAH
SO THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT FOR FREE OR SOMETHING
BUT IT IT'S NOT HERE SO FAR
OKAY I'M I'M FINE WITH THIS BUT I CAN MAKE IT RUN ON MY MACHINE
OKAY
OKAY
AND AND THE ENGINE IS IS IN THE FESTIVAL ITSELF
SO IT'S JUST A VOICE TO TO OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM MM
OKAY
HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
OKAY
UH IT'S RIGHT I MEAN
YEAH I JUST S USE THE DOUGLAS ADAMS UH UH THAT THAT BOOK YOU KNOW THE MM HOW IT'S CALLED
JUST GENERAL ENGLISH TEXTBOOK I I CHO I TRIED
NO THE T. T. X. T.
YEAH ASCII FILE BASICALLY
YOU HAVE TO BUT YOU CAN TAKE A P. D. F. AND CONVERT P. D. F. TO ASCII
YEAH
IT WAS A LINE WITH HASHES AND IT WAS HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH HASH
UH I'M NOT THEN I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO MUCH INTO DETAILS JUST A LITTLE BIT
MM WELL I CAN PREPARE S SORRY
THESE ARE THE EDINBURGH PEOPLE NO
MM-HMM YEAH VOICE
THAT I KNOW
UM UH
N UH
N UH
MM
AT THIS PRECISE TIME YEAH
UH YOU CAN'T ATTEND MULTIPLE SESSION AT THE SAME TIME SO
HMM
MM-HMM YEAH IN
HMM
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
HMM
BUT YEAH
YEAH
I LIKED THE INVITED SPEAKER UM ABOUT THE IMPLANT IN THE EAR
IT'S QUITE GOOD NO
I THINK SO YEAH
YEAH
MM
HMM
HMM
NO QUITE GOOD UH
A BIT HOT STILL BUT THE BEA THE BEACH NEARBY IS QUITE NICE YEAH
YOU SHOULD TRY IT I DON'T KNOW
DID YOU GO AROUND
BEFORE OR AFTER YEAH
OKAY
YEAH 'CAUSE I
YEAH I STAYED I STAYED TWO DAYS BEFORE SO UH I WENT YOU JU YOU JUST TAKE THE TRAIN MAYBE THAT'S THE SAME I'M NOT SURE
TRAIN NORTH
HALF AN HOUR TRAIN YEAH
YEAH
WEST OR NORTH I DON'T KNOW UH
NO NO NO NOT VERY FAR
NO NO
IT'S DIFFERENT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
HMM
WELL Y
WE CAN TAKE THE TRAM AND A TRAIN
IT'S IT'S ALL CONDITIONED
YEAH
AH
MM
AH SORRY
NO NO NO IT'S UH OR S I'M NOT SURE
YEAH
YEAH ORIGINALLY I BROUGHT IT BECAUSE I MARKED SOME PAPERS BUT YEAH
ONL ONLY O ONE WHICH SURPRISED ME A BIT IT WAS UH SPEAKER RECOGNITION I THINK BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
THEY WERE TRYING TO MODEL UH UM COVARIANCE OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS FOR G. M. M. INSTEAD OF USING A DIAGONAL
BUT THEN IF YOU USE A FULL IT'S TOO MUCH
SO THEY USE SOME APPROACH WHERE THEY TIE THEM AUTOMATICALLY AND UH AFTER THAT WELL
IT'S MORE LIKE TYING IT IS STILL FULL BUT DIFFERENT UM COMPONENTS ARE TIED DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE MATRIX ARE TIED
EQUAL
UH
NO NO YOU HAVE TO STORE A MINIMUM NUMBER A REDUCED NUMBER OF PARAMETERS
AND THEY ARE TIED IN A LINEAR WAY ACTUALLY SORRY NOT EQUAL BUT IT DOESN'T
YEAH EXACTLY THAT'S IT UH
SO THEY JU YEAH
YEAH
INTERESTING THING IS THAT THEY APPLIED IT ON SPEAKER RECOGNITION AND ON THE FEATURES BEFORE THEY HAD THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO UM DECORRELATE THE FEATURES
AND AND THIS THEY SHOWED IT UH WITHOUT THIS
WITH DIAGONAL G. M. M. OR WITH THIS AND WITH THIS WITH UH SEMI TIED COVARIANCE MATRICES
IT WAS A LESS MUCH LESS SENSITIVE TO UH WHICH UM DECORRELATION PROCEDURE YOU CHOOSE
IF Y SO
A A ALSO BETTER BUT OF COURSE IT DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF OF PARAMETERS YOU PUT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I I THINK I THINK IT WAS EVEN SLIGHTLY BETTER YEAH
MAYBE I CAN FIND IT
L. D. A. YEAH L. D. A.
MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO USE UH A FULL COVARIANCE MATRIX
YEAH
YEAH IT'S THIS ONE
IT'S I IMPROVED COVARIANCE MODELLING
YEAH
NO BUT IN THE PROCEEDINGS YOU CAN FIND THEM
THEY ARE BETTER YEAH
THEY TRIED P. C. A. L. D. A. M. L. L. T.
I I IT'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING NEW BUT UH THE MM THEY JUST APPLIED THAT TO SPEAKER I. D.
YEAH
YEAH
I ISN'T IT SMALLER THE MINIMUM NO
I DON'T KNOW I JUST
MM
MM
YEAH OKAY
BUT IT'S NOT UH AN INTRINSIC LIMITATION IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF RI YEAH
OKAY
SO IT'S NOT N IT'S NOT SYMMETRIC NECESSARILY
'KAY
SO HE'S MAXIMISING THAT OR MM
MM
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH HO YEAH
HOW DID YOU COPE WITH WHAT YOU MENTIONED SOME TIME BEFORE
THAT IF IT'S A VERY LONG SESSION FOR EACH TWELVE POINT FIVE FRAME YOU WILL ACTUALLY GET THE SAME SEGMENT NOW
SO HOW D
AH OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
SORRY
MM UH WHAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT WHAT NIST IS TRYING TO DO NO
SO
YEAH BU
YEAH BUT THEN WE ALL OPTIMISE UH ON THE SAME TASK
SO YOU CANNOT GET ANYTHING NEW OUT OF THAT AFTER SOME TIME
YEAH BUT THEN YOU RUN OUT OF TIME
NO I IDEALLY YOU'RE CORRECT UH BUT
MM
SO YEAH
HO HOW HOW DO THEY HOW DO THEY EVALUATE
I JUST DON'T KNOW
SO THEY ASK PEOP THEY ASK PEOPLE TO SIT AND LISTEN BASICALLY
YEAH
HMM
OKAY
BUT THEY D THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MEASURE LIKE YOU HAVE AN ORIGINAL SPEECH YOU TRANSCRIBE IT AND
OKAY
HMM
HMM
HMM
MM
SO MAYBE WELL BUT THEN WELL NO IF SOMEBODY LIKE NIST WILL HAVE ONE RECOGNISER AND YOU JUST PLUG A DIFFERENT FEATURE BUT UH IT'S DANGEROUS
RIGHT
MM
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
HEM HEMANT IS USING DIFFERENCE
SEEMS
HMM
MM
YEAH
WOULD BE MM WOULD BE NICE FOR AURORA MAYBE TO HAVE THAT
AUR AURORA
YEAH
NO NO BUT YEAH YEAH
MM
HMM
YEAH
HMM
YEAH DAIMLER YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU KNOW THEY'RE EXTREMELY SECRETIVE
I HAD A HARD TIME JUST TO GET THE SIGNALS
SO I ASKED OTHER QUESTIONS BUT UH IT'S QUITE TOUGH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THEY HAVE TO YEAH
THEY HAVE YEAH THEY HAVE TO DO SOME TEST IN THEIR MERCEDES SOME SPEECH RECOGNITION TEST MM BUT IT SEEMS NOW THEY MM AT LEAST DAIMLER
THEY MOSTLY WORK ON DIALOGUE MANAGEMENT UH BUT NOT MUCH ON FEATURES AND RECOGNITION
NO
YEAH
I D I MM
I DOUBT THEY ARE TRYING RIGHT NOW
I DOUBT THAT AT DAIMLER THEY ARE TRYING RIGHT NOW BUT MAYBE OTHER COMPANIES MM
UH
COHEN
JORDA JORDAN COHEN
NO NO
MM
MM
BUT THERE YOU COULD SEND AN S. M. S. I THINK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH YOU COULD DICTATE TEXT SO
ON A PHONE YEAH
THE PHONE THAT UH COHEN YEAH VOICE SIGNALS
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW THAT'S
OKAY
HMM
SO IT'S STILL STILL REAL TIME
HMM
AH OKAY BUT BUT NOT MUCH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH STILL DOESN'T FEEL NATURAL
I I WISH YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE ROOM WOULD JUST DETECT WHEN AN WHEN A MEETING'S STARTED IT STARTING
VOILA COOL
SO YOU BETTER START
IT WAS YOUR IDEA
SO
WELL MAYBE UH IS IS THE WHITE BOARD WORKING
OR OR NOT
UM Y MAYBE SHOW US THE GENERAL SORT OF OUTLINE
YOU KEEP W OKAY YOU CAN JUST WRITE IT ON THE PAPER
YEAH
SO IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL P. L. P. TWO STUFF THEN IS THAT
UH 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU STARTED WITH WASN'T IT
THIS THIS STUFF THAT MARIUS
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
H HE'S PARAMETERIZING IT BOTH TEMPORALLY AND ACROSS THE SPECTRUM YEP
YEAH
YEAH
YEP OKAY
YEP
YEAH TO THAT
YEP YEP YEP
MM YEAH BUT IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A DIFFERENT LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL ISN'T IT
IT'S A COMPLEX LINEAR PREDICTION OR WHATEVER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
OKAY
OKAY
YOU NEED THE PHASE
OOH UH
WELL
WELL IT DEPENDS ON HOW THIS I I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING B YEAH JUST THE CARRIER
OKAY SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY PHASE BUT IF YOU'RE USING SOME SORT OF SINUSOIDAL CODING IT'S PHASE YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
W
WHAT SO WHAT SORT OF BIT RATE DO YOU GET FOR THE UM ENCODING OF THE THIS THE HILBERT TRANSFORM
THE S THE SPECTROGRAM
W WHAT SORT OF CODING DO YOU GET SO FAR FOR THE NO NO NO NO F F YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEP
UH WO WELL IT'S NO NO NO BUT WHAT SORT OF BIT RATE DO YOU GET
IS IT IS IT UH ID DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF M IDEA OF WHAT SORT OF BAND WIDTHS
YEAH
'CAUSE
OKAY AND THAT'S IN THAT'S WITH THE FULLY OPTIMISED SORT OF COMPRESSION SCHEME OR THAT'S JUST THE RAW DATA OR
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
SURE SURE
YOU JUST CUT OUT M BANDS AND JUST USE INTERPOLATION OR WHATEVER
YEAH
T SO THAT'S ONE POINT OKAY THAT'S WITH THE FULL SPECTRUM BASICALLY BEING USED THEN
YEAH
YEP YEP
YEP
YEP
YEAH YEP
OKAY THAT'S QUITE GOOD
SO AND HYNEK WAS SHOWING ME HOW SCALABLE IT IS IN TERMS OF UM YOU CAN TAKE HALF THE BANDS AWAY AND STILL GET DECENT PERFORMANCE
YOU TAKE YOU TAKE THREE QUARTERS OF THEM AWAY IT STARTS TO DEGRADE BUT IT'S STILL INTELLIGIBLE THAT SORT OF THING
YEP
OKAY
AND THAT'S WITHOUT DOING ANY SORT OF UM PREDICTION OF WHAT THE MISSING BANDS MIGHT BE RIGHT
YOU JUST LEAVE THEM OUT
I MEAN YOU YOU SHOU YOU COULD BE ABLE TO DO SOME SORT OF CODE MISSING DATA SORT OF BAYES STUFF YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
IT IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A SCALABLE SCHEME THOUGH WOULDN'T IT
LIKE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A NICE SCALABLE SCHEME FOR THE FOR FOR THE THE CODING OF THE THE SMOOTH SPECTRUM
IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SCALABLE CODING SCHEME FOR THE FOR THE VOICE SIGNAL AS WELL RIGHT
WELL I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST
WELL AT DIFFERENT BIT RATES
SO THE ACTUAL UH EXCITATION AS WELL
BECAUSE I MEAN IT'D BE NICE UH L LET'S SAY IF YOU HAD TWELVE HUNDRED BITS FOR THE FOR THE SP SMOOTH SPECTRUM AND TWELVE HUNDRED BITS FOR THE VOICE
AND THEN YOU COULD SCALE THEM BOTH
YEAH
SURE SURE SURE
YEAH
UH
NO NO
JUST LONG AS IT'S SOME SORT OF NON LINEAR
YEP
M
THE PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON THE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
HMM
AND THEN VECTOR QUANTIZE OR WHATEVER
YEAH
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
SO TIMES FIFTEEN
TWEN THAT'S T IT'S TWENTY TIMES FIFTEEN IT'S NOT
OKAY
SO IT'S IT'S YEAH IT'S THREE HUNDRED
IT I MEAN IT'S IT'S TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED SORT OF PARAMETERS PER SECOND
UM
WELL Y YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT CARRYING TRANSMITTING THAT AT ALL REALLY AT THIS POINT IN TIME
I UH
AND AND YOU GET WHISPERING TYPE SYNTHESIS YEAH
YEP
OR ONE OF THESE GLOTTAL PULSE THINGS
F AND JUST USE BASIC L. P. C. TEN STYLE
YEAH WHICH IS WHICH IS PROBABLY I MEAN
IF YOU'RE GOING TO AIM FOR LIKE A VERY LOW RATE CODE TO BELOW FIVE HUNDRED BITS PER SECOND I GUESS
THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY FINE
BUT
UH THE LOWEST STANDARD IS MELP I THINK WHICH IS TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED THE STANDARD
IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT TWELVE HUNDRED F BITS PER SECOND USING MORE MORE COMPLICATED QUANTIZATION SCHEMES AND STUFF LIKE THAT I THINK
I THINK SO YEAH
I S I SAW THAT THEY USED MATRIX QUANTISATION ON THE L. P. UH ON THE L. S. F. PARAMETERS OR WHATEVER
BUT I MEAN THAT'S QUITE IT BECOMES QUITE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE
BUT I MEAN I IMAGINE THE SAME SORT OF APPROACH COULD BE TAKEN WITH YOURS AS WELL
NO
YEAH THAT'S THE SAME
TWENTY MELP*'S A LOT BETTER QUALITY THOUGH
YEAH
NO NO
I THINK I THINK I THINK I THINK CELP OR CELP OR HOWEVER YOU PRONOUNCE THAT
IT'S ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED I THINK
YEAH
OR BASED AROUND THAT
YEAH
OKAY
IT'S NOT TERRIBLY INTERESTING THOUGH REALLY
YEAH
SO I'M
WELL YOU YOU'VE WELL I MEAN YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF OPTIONS HAVEN'T YOU
YOU CAN USE LIKE UH A CODEC SIDED OR YOU COULD USE A
SINUSOIDAL BASED
NO
YEAH YEAH
SURE SURE SURE
YEAH BUT WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING
I I MEAN 'CAUSE C I I I SUSPECT THERE SOMETHINGS LIKE UM CELP
YOU'RE GONNA GET H LOT HIGHER BAND WIDTH AREN'T YOU
I MEAN IT'S A HIGH BAND WIDTH STANDARD
SO YEAH
OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
OKAY
HMM
OKAY
SO I MEAN
HOW
YEP
YEAH
'CAUSE IT'S A BIT TRICKY ISN'T IT
THAT'S IT'S NOT LIKE A STANDARD I'M JUST THINKING I MEAN WHAT SORT OF OPT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN'T JUST DO STANDARD UM
YOU KNOW INVERSE FILTERING FOR UM SIGNAL RECONSTRUCTION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT CAN YOU
UH OH OKAY AND THEN YOU JUST THEN YOU JUST DO THE INVERSE F. F. T. OR WHATEVER
OKAY THE OTH I MEAN THE OTHER O
MM YEAH
BUT THAT'S GONNA BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HAVING PHASE PROBLEMS IS THAT WHEN YOU
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
HMM
AND NOW I MEAN THERE IS THERE ARE UM MM THERE IS RESEARCH UH UM PU THAT'S BEEN PUBLISHED SHOWING
YOU KNOW SPEECH RECONSTRUCTION FROM THE ESSENTIALLY THE SPECTROGRAM WITHOUT PHASE INFORMATION
YEAH
SO
YES
YES BUT I MEAN YOU CAN RECONSTRUCT THE THE F THE TH THE ENTIRE
SPECTROGRAM FROM THAT CAN'T YOU
SO YOU COULD DO IT THAT WAY
CAUSE I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S A HEAPS OF THERE HEAPS OF OPTIONS
LIKE IF Y YOU BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS SINUSOIDAL CODING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ALL YOU NEED IS THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SPECTROGRAM IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES AND
YEAH
YEAH
YE
JUST BY REFITTING
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
D IT'S TH
YEAH
BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE BIG THING AT THE MOMENT ISN'T IT
IF IF YOU'RE MM IF I IF THE IF THE EXCI IF THE IF THE ENCODING RATE'S TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND FOR THE THE EXCITATION COMPONENT OF THE SIGNAL
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW EFFICIENT YOUR UM ENCODING OF THE SPECTROGRAM IS YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA HAVE A HIGH RELATIVELY HIGH BIT RATE
YEAH
NAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH SURE
WELL ONE COULD ARGUE IT'S IT'S A FIELD THAT'S QUITE A SORT OF A NICHE THESE DAYS ISN'T IT
UM
IN STANDARDS AND YEAH
MM YEAH
WELL DID YOU SAY UH WHO SAID
YEAH
IS IT NOKIA'S BEING SUED IN THE U. S. FOR THEIR TRI BAND USAGE 'CAUSE YOU KNOW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
UH NO NO G G. S. M. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE G. S. M. IN THE U. S.
OR I DIDN'T HAVE G. S. M. IN THE U. S.
UH IT'S F UH OKAY
NO NO N
UH WELL THAT'S TRI BAND S YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEP
AND APPARENTLY NOKIA'S IN A BIT OF TROUBLE OVER THAT ONE BUT YEAH
WELL IT'S INTERESTING
YEAH
SHOULD'VE BEEN A LAWYER
WELL THAT'S
BUT I MEAN CODING IS A MUCH MORE SORT OF IT'S IT'S IT WELL I MEAN IT'S IT'S UH IT WHEN IT BOILS DOWN TO JUST MATHEMATICS TO A LARGE EXTENT
DOESN'T IT
IT'S IT'S JUST UH SORT OF IT'S YOU KNOW COMMUNICATIONS S SORT OF NO
YEAH
SURE SURE
YEAH
SURE SURE
PUSH TO TALK AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEP
AND I MEAN AS YOU SAY I MEAN THAT DELAY IS I MEAN YOU CAN SQUASH THAT DELAY TO SOME EXTENT RIGHT
I N I THINK AS FAR AS THE CO YOU KNOW C C DELILAH'S CODING GOES
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PROBABLY DO MUCH MORE THAN WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED
BECAUSE TO GET HIGHER COMPRESSION YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REDUNDANCY OVER LONGER TIME SPANS
SO
YEAH SURE BUT I MEAN THAT'S TRANSMISSION DELAY NOT ALGORITHMIC DELAY
IF YOU ADD THOSE TOGETHER YOU END UP WITH A THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO I GUESS
WE MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE ELSE JOINING OUR UH MEETING SOON
OH YEAH
I DON'T KNOW I MEAN UH YOU'D BE YOU TRIED SINUSOIDAL CODING BASED APPROACHES DIDN'T YOU
SINUSOIDAL CODING
YEAH BUT SURE
YEAH M YEAH TR YEAH IT'S A YEAH
BUT I MEAN THE TH THE THE THING IS YOU'D NEED TI IT PART OF THE PARAMETER SET FOR THAT IS UH THE UM UH THE F UH THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES
AND THEN ONE WAY OF COMPRESSING THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES IS JUST STORING THE SMOOTH SPECTRUM
AND THEN YOU CAN UH AND THEN YOU CAN INTERPOLATE YEAH
YOU CAN JUST PICK THE THE UM THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES ON THAT SPECTRUM WHEN YOU RECONSTRUCT ON THAT SMOOTH VERSION OF THE SPECTRUM WHEN YOU RECONSTRUCT
Y YEAH
WELL I WAS JUST SAYING
YEAH
YEP
YEAH WELL I I TH IT'S HIGH
IT'S QUITE A HIGH BIT RATE
BUT I MEAN ONCE WE IT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SCALABLE
WELL IT I MEAN YOU CAN USE AS MANY HARMONICS AS YOU WANT
I M H UH HE WAS JUST USING THE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY
AND IF YOU SMOOTH IT DOING A SMOOTH SPECTRUM REPRESENTATION OF THE HARMONIC AMPLITUDES
THEN YOU ONLY NEED TO STORE THE THE THE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY AND AND THE AND THE MAXIMUM VOICE FREQUENCY
AND EVERYTHING ELSE CAN BE YEAH S YEAH SURE
SO AND THEN BUT THEN THE TRICKY THE ONLY TRICKY THING THAT WE HADN'T FIGURED OUT WAS THE PHASE INFORMATION
UM BUT Y BUT UH YOU CAN STILL GET A LIKE YOU GET TH UM BASICALLY IF YOU DO PHASE UNWRAPPING AND ALL OF THESE OTHER TRICKS
YOU END UP WITH SOME SORT OF PHASE REPRESENTATION WHICH IS SOME SORT OF MONOTONICALLY DECREASING FUNCTION
YEAH UNWRAPPED YEAH
SO I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD CONCEIVABLY REPRESENT IN SOME SORT OF LOW SORT OF R YOU KNOW LOW BIT RATE REPRESENTATION I GUESS
AND THEN MAYBE YOU'D NEED SOME SORT OF CORRECTION TO UM TO CORRECT MINOR PHASE DISCONTINUITIES AT SOME POINT IN TIME
'CAU
YEAH YEAH SURE
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
SURE SURE
YEAH
YEP
YEAH YEAH
HMM
NO AND YOU UH YOU WANNA AVOID HARD CHOICES ON VOICING DECISION YEAH
WELL THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH L. P. C. TEN FOR INSTANCE
I IT STINKS BECAUSE THIS HARD YEAH
YEAH SURE
YEAH
YEAH YEP
BUT BUT THAT THAT TWO HUNDRED THIS IS WHAT THEY USE FOR LIKE UM ST THEY THEY DO USE THIS FOR UM FOR UM PITCH MARKING IN SPEECH
SO THIS IS WHAT ALAN BLACK'S CODE USES
BUT IT'S VERY SPEAKER DEPENDENT WH ON WHAT SORT OF BAND WIDTH YOU'D LOOK AT THIS HILBERT ENVELOPE
DEPENDING ON THE PITCH DEPENDING ON THE PERSON Y YOU'LL GET A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF SMOOTHING AND A CERTAIN SORT OF SO I MEAN
YOU KNOW IF IT'S A FEMALE SPEAKER FOR INSTANCE YOU YEAH
SO IT'S SORTA TRICKY
YEAH
UH N NO
Y YEAH BUT FROM MEMORY THAT THAT BASIC SCRIPT THAT THEY HAD WASN'T WASN'T VERY UM EFFECTIVE
I MEAN MAYBE IF YOU DID SOME SORT OF INITIAL FIRST P GUESS AND THEN AND THEN CHOSE YOUR SMOOTHING FACTOR BASED ON THAT
'CAUSE IT IT YOU KNOW SELECTING AT ANY PARTICULAR POINT OF WHAT THE WHAT THE PITCH IS AT THE MAY BE INACCURATE
BUT IF YOU ESTIMATED IT OVER A SECOND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A DECENT ESTIMATE I'D I'D THINK
YEAH
WELL IT'D BE NICE TO IT WOULD BE NICE TO REALLY SEE WHAT THIS WHAT YOU'RE A ACTUALLY TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT HERE
THIS CARRIER SIGNAL WHAT WHAT IT REALLY LOOKS L YEAH
AND YOU DID SAY IT LOOKS LIKE A FREQUENCY MODULATED COSINE
HMM
YEAH
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 'CAUSE PITCH SHIFTS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
HMM
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
YEAH IT'S LIKE A YEAH
AND IT IT DOES START TO GET A LITTLE BIT N NON LINEAR TOWARDS THE END
BUT NORMALLY THAT'S THAT'S WHEN THE COMPONENTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY PROBABLY GONNA BE AUDIBLE ANYWAY IN VOICED SPEECH RIGHT
SO YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SURE
C
C 'CAUSE ANY SORT OF ERROR IN THAT IN THAT LINE IS IS TRANSMITTED IS REALISED IN A NET AS A PHASE ERROR RIGHT
YEAH
MM
OKAY
MM YEAH
TRICKY YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
Y Y Y YOU HAVE S FIVE SLICES LIKE N ACROSS THAT WAY I GUESS
YEAH
HMM
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE 'CAUSE IT'S A TIME DOMAIN SORT OF APPROACH
UM AND I MEAN UH AND AND IN IN FACT I MEAN IT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS SO DIFFERENT TO MOST APPROACHES TO SPEECH CODING THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT OR HAVEN'T HAD MUCH I IT'S I MEAN IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT TO A LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL SORT UH SO UH VOI UM YOU KNOW
SOURCE FILTER TYPE APPROACHES OR OR WHATEVER YEAH
SO
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF MINIMUM DISTORTION TIME
YEAH
SURE
UNVOICED UNVOICED SPEECH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO B SORT OF JUDGE ON QUALITY COMPARED TO VOICED I THINK
PLOSIVES
YEAH PLOSIVES ARE VERY IMPORTANT THOUGH I GUESS
SO MAYBE IT DOES A BETTER JOB OF PLOSIVES
OKAY
IT'D BE NICE IF WE HAD SOME DEMOS HERE
WELL I SUPPOSE HAVE TO WAIT TO YOUR I GUESS
OH IT'S A LITTLE WA OH BUGGER
I WON'T BE YEAH
NO
YOU'LL PRACTICE IT BEFORE THEN WON'T YOU
YEAH HE'S GOING TO OZ
YEP
I DID YEAH
BUT WE'RE D WE'RE DOING A MORE TRADITIONAL S S FREQUENCY SLICES RATHER THAN TEMPORAL BASED STUFF
YEAH
WELL THAT'S W THAT WAS ONE OF THE APPROACHES SURE
YEP
AND THE OTHER APPROACH WAS WAS THIS H. M. M. BASED STUFF WHICH IS WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST A PARAMETERIZATION OF THE YOU KNOW
THE THE THE THE UM THE SOURCE FILTER TYPE PARAMETERS AND THEN AND THEN LEARNING THE YOU KNOW TRAINING LIKE A H SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM
BUT THAT'S NOT TERRIBLY THAT'S GOT NO RELATIONSHIP TO THIS
I IT'S YEAH
YEAH SURE
SPEECH CODING
I I READ SOME OF THE OTHER TECHNIQUES
UM LITTLE STANDARDS
BUT UM I MEAN I THINK I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THE ANALYSIS BY SYNTHESIS BUT THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW WHAT SORT OF BIT RATES YOU'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE OR UM AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO IT SEPARATELY FOR EACH UM BAND
IT WOULD BE THE I IMAGINE THAT'S THE TRICKY PART
UM BECAUSE IT WOULD BE VARYING QUITE RAPIDLY WOULDN'T IT YOUR UM YOUR UH CODE BOOK
LIKE W WITHIN EACH UM WHEN YOU GO ALONG THE THE THE B THE ONE SECOND SORT OF SEGMENT OF THE BAND YOU
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WELL I MEAN YEAH
FIRST YOU'VE GOTTA CHOOSE YOUR APPROACH AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE BAND WIDTH
AND THEN START THINKING ABOUT HOW TO GIVEN 'CAUSE I MEAN I GUESS ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE THIS IS A THIS IS A MORE OF A COMMERCIAL BASED PROJECT
YOU'VE G C YOU'VE YOU'VE GOTTA I MATCH THE QUALITY BEFORE YOU START WORRYING ABOUT OTHER THINGS RIGHT
I MEAN D D DO THEY I MEAN WHAT WHAT WHAT SORT OF UH
UH-HUH OKAY
WELL THAT MAKES THINGS UH
WITH
THEY'RE HAPPY
OKAY
COOL
YEAH
SURE SURE
AND AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE AT SORT OF A POINT WHERE MAYBE YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE A LITTLE BIT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH WHICH IS NOT
YEAH
YEAH
AL ALTHOUGH THE STANDARDS DEPENDING ON WHAT STANDARD YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOMETIMES IT CAN BE QUITE AMBIGUOUS RIGHT
I MEAN ALL THE M. PEG STANDARDS ARE BASICALLY THIS IS THE CONTAINER WE DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT RIGHT
BUT IT'S GOTTA FIT INSIDE THIS THIS SORT OF THIS SORT OF FORMAT
OKAY
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE V AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DO M. O. S. UM TESTING AND
OKAY
WELL HO IT
OKAY
MM
YEAH YEAH
WELL I TH
NO NO NO
UH NO NO NO
YEP
WELL THE THE WHAT'S WHAT'S NEW IS IN THE TRANSMISSION MEDIUM
LIKE YOU KNOW NEW LIKE HIGHER BAND WIDTH TRANSMISSION OR UH OR LIKE PACKET PACKETIZED BASED TRANSMISSION
AND THEN ALL TH THAT SORT OF THING
THE WHERE TH WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT SO MUCH LOOKING AT THE ALGORITHM
BUT SO MUCH AS HOW TO INCORPORATE THE ALGORITHM WITHIN A NEW TRANSI MISSION SORT OF S MEDIUM
BASICALLY S LIKE I MEAN IF YOU D IF YOU SEE A LOT OF PAPERS ON LIKE UM ON UH VOICE OVER I. P. OR WHATEVER
THE THE PUBLICATIONS ARE SORT OF LIKE UM HOW DO WE DEAL WITH PACKET LOSS
OR OR HOW WAS IT AFFECTED BY PACKET LOSS AND AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT
YEAH SURE
YEAH
AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE CODE AND ALL THAT SORTA STUFF
YEAH
BUT EVEN THAT'S LESS OF A BIG DEAL NOW RIGHT BECAUSE ALL THE LITTLE UM I. S YEAH
NOT REALLY
YOU COULD TROW MATLAB ON A MOBILE PHONE THESE DAYS
WELL MAYBE NOT BUT
YEAH
Y YEAH
YEAH WHICH DAVID DID YEAH
IT'S GOOD YEAH
YEAH WE'VE GOT ALL HIS CODE IMPLEMENTED
SO UH IT WASN'T PERFECT
THERE WAS LITTLE BIT OF BUGS WITH SOME OF THE MATCHING
BUT IT WAS PRETTY HARD TO TELL THAT IT WAS M NOT NOT PERFECT UNLESS YOU HEARD THE SAMPLES SORT OF NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER
SO THAT'S NOT TOO BAD
OH SURE
AND I MEAN IT
WELL TH
THE ONLY TRICK IS THE PHASE
AND WE'VE GOT A STUDENT STARTING IN JANUARY WHO'S GONNA START WORKING ON ON HOW TO ACTUALLY EFFICIENTLY PARAMETERIZE THE UM THE H. M. M. YEAH YEAH
AND I THINK I THINK WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF IDEAS FOR THE THE SPECTRUM
THAT'S EASILY ENOUGH HANDLED JUST USING STANDARD TECHNIQUES
BUT THE
WITHOUT PHASE
I'VE GOT NO IDEA
UH YOU REVIEWED A PAPER ON A
UH STEVEN COX ISN'T IT
YEAH
UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA
IT'S NEAR C SORT OF IT'S IT'S NEAR THE SORTA CAMBRIDGE SIDE OF ENGLAND I GUESS
NO THE MUCH MORE MATHEMATICAL I THINK
YEAH JUST BASICALLY DOING A SEARCH THROUGH OR OR STUFF STUFF LIKE THAT DON'T THEY
OR
YEAH
YEAH
NO
YEAH YEAH
SURE
WHERE YOU'VE ONLY GOT THE M. F. C. C. S
BUT TH I THINK I THINK THE I THINK IT WAS TO WAS IT TO DO WITH AURORA OR SOMETHING
THE OKAY
I WAS
OKAY
YEAH BUT IT W IT WAS FOR SAY UM SAY YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE WHO HAS YOU KNOW
THEY WANNA DISPUTE THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SAID BY THE RECOGNITION
AND THE RECOGNITION NETWORK WAS WRONG AND YOU OWE ME MONEY OR WHATEVER
UM AND THEN THEY CAN SAY WELL WE'VE WE'VE RECONSTRUCTED YOUR SPEECH FROM THE SPEECH RECOGNI INPUT TO THE SPEECH RECOGNIZER
HEY VOILA IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU UH UH I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT THAN THAT
THERE'S A LOT OF SORT OF WELL DOES THE QUALITY STAND UP TO LEGAL SORT OF REQUIREMENTS OR WHATEVER
BUT UM
OH NO THAT THERE'S A SEPARATE SET OF STANDARDS I THINK FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
Y YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEP
WHICH UH I THINK REQUIRES YOU KNOW THAT STATES THE UN THE INFORMATION THEY CAN SEND IS THIS
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU TACK ON ANY EXTRA PHASE INFORMATION OR WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHAT YOU'RE GIVEN
SO
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
I I IT WOULD BE INTERESTING
YOU I MEAN MAYBE THAT'S THE BEST APPROACH TO LOOK AT TO BEGIN WITH IS JUST PRETEND ALL YOU HAVE GOT IS
YEAH
UM BECAUSE YOU CAN ALSO INTERPOLATE THE PITCH INFORMATION FROM THE THE SPECTRUM AS WELL
THEY DO THAT
YEAH
SO I MEAN MAYBE TRY TO SEE HOW GOOD YOU CAN GO WITHOUT TRANSMITTING ANY OF THAT INFORMATION
THE PITCH WAS REALLY GOOD I THOUGHT
I TH DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD REALLY TELL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT BUT THE THING IS IF IT'S MEL SCALED IF YOU HAVE A MEL SCALE
YOU GET QUITE FINE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SPECTRUM AT THE LOWER FREQUENCIES IT WHICH IS WHAT YOU NEED FOR RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PITCH ANYWAY
SO I MEAN IF YOU WANTED TO TRANSMIT WITH FEWER BANDS YOU'D MAYBE STILL KEEP THE LOWER BANDS OR OR MAYBE YOU COULD STILL TRANSMIT THE PITCH
THE PITCH ISN'T THAT BIG A DEAL
BUT IT'D BE NICE IF YOU DIDN'T BECAUSE THEN I MEAN THAT'S WELL
I MEAN IT'S WORTH GIVING IT A GO AND THEN MEN MAYBE SEEING WH WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN ADD TO THE DATA STREAM TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE
UM
I DON'T KNOW
THAT THAT'D BE COOL
SO GET CODING
MM I THINK W
AH WELL I MEAN HUFFMAN'S EASY ENOUGH
BUT BUT YEAH SURE
UH THAT THAT'S WHERE I STOP
RUN LENGTH ENCODING I'M OUT OF HERE
OKAY
I MEAN I I TH I THINK THEY DO TRY TO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE THE THE TECHNIQUES THEY THEY CHOOSE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LESS
YOU KNOW SUSCEPTIBLE TO CODING ERRORS LET'S SAY
YOU KNOW I BUT I MEAN THAT'S MAYBE THE THE LIMIT TO THAT
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH AT LEAST ON PAPER
YEAH
YEAH AT LEAST YOU CAN WRITE ON THE P
YEAH CELP
YEAH
HMM
NO BUT MARIUS IS IT'S SIMILAR STUFF
NO MARIUS IS ALSO USING LIKE HILBERT TRANSFORM AND THEN
BOTH
YEAH
UH IS SOME KIND OF D. C. T. OR AGAIN YEAH
YEAH OK
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
HOW C
MM-HMM
YEAH
BECAUSE USE LINEAR PHASE OR
YEAH UH OH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
SAME FREQUENCY
YEAH
FOR L. S. F.
MAIN BIT RATE
WHAT IS
GOOD
OH
AH OKAY
HMM
HMM
S
YEAH
HMM
HMM
YEAH YEAH
HMM
OH YEAH TYPE
HMM
S
HMM
S SO
OH OKAY
SMOOTHED
OR LIKE APPLY MORE
HMM
AH
HMM
SO AFTER YOU'RE DOING L. S. F. S SO OR LIKE I MEAN HOW YOU'RE FINALLY HAND CODING
AH
OH
YEAH
SO FIRST YOU APPLY THESE TRIANGLE FILTERS AND THEN DO L. P. C. CODING OR LIKE
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
FILTERS
YEAH
OH OKAY
HMM
YOU CAN DO THE L. P. ANALYSIS ON EACH SUB BAND YEAH
YEAH M YEAH OK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO HOW MANY L. S. F. S YOU'RE USING AND
OH OKAY
SO BUT YOU HOW MANY BANDS YOU'RE USING
IF YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT SKIPPING ANY BANDS OR LIKE OH OK FIFTEEN INTO TWENTY THEN
LIKE UH
HMM
AH
OH YEAH
BUT PHASE YOU'RE NOT ENCODING ANYTHING
PHASE YOU'RE DIRECTLY TRANSMITTING THAT
UH NO TH YEAH YEAH YEAH
THE PHASE OF HILBERT ENVELOPE
YOU'RE NOT TRANSMITTING AT ALL LIKE
YEAH YEAH IS NOISE
FOURIER
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHAT IS THE CELP STANDARD NOW
LIKE IT'S IT'S TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND
OR THE
OH THAT TWO TWO KILO BITS PER T
AH OK
AH
SOME
YEAH YEAH
BUT
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
BUT THIS IS CODEC CENTRED NO
YOU HAVE CODE BOOK
SO
OH IT'S NOT CODECS CODE BOOK
THERE IS NOT CODE BOOK
OH OK
OH
YEAH CELP IS
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S AROUND ONE KILO BYTE LIKE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A I THINK EVEN G. S. M. AND ALL THIS G. SEVEN TWO NINE
YEAH YEAH
ON BASED ON CELP
AT LEAST IT GIVES
BUT STILL THEY USE A CODE BOOK NO
SO THAT'S REALLY UH IT'S MAYBE BETTER THAN LIKE USING JUST RANDOM NOISE OR
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HUH
YEAH
AH OKAY
HMM
BUT
HMM
INVERSE YEAH
INVERSE HILBERT
YEAH
YEAH
OR OUTPUT SIGNAL LIKE
YEAH
AND THEN YEAH
YEAH YEAH
HMM
OH OK
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
BUT YEAH BUT IT'S MORE TOWARDS INDUSTRY NO
LIKE THE YEAH BECAUSE I WORKED IN A INDUSTRY FOR LIKE A SMALL TIME
BUT THEY'RE THEY USED TO IMPLEMENT ALL THESE CODERS G. S. M. AND I. T. U. STANDARDS
NO JUST BEFORE MY P. H. D.
FOR LIKE FEW MONTHS
YEAH BUT THAT'S UH LIKE INDUSTRY IT'S REALLY A BIG DEAL LIKE
SO THEY THEY THEY WORK ON A LOT OF THESE STANDARDS
YEAH
BUT MOSTLY THEY'RE ALL BASED ON CELP LIKE MAINLY
YEAH
SO
HOW
TRI BAND IS G. S. M.
C. D. M. A.
NO NO BUT C. D. M. IS THERE BUT NOW SLOWLY THEY'RE INTRODUCING G. S. M. ALSO NOW IN U. S. LIKE
YEAH G. S. M. TRI BAND
LIKE THE FREQUENCIES ARE DIFFERENT LIKE VERY UH
AH
YEAH
NOW IT'S REALLY BIG COMPETITION
YEAH
STANDARD MAYBE LIKE ESTABLISHED
YEAH
SO WHERE DO YOU THINK YOUR THING IS USEFUL
IN C. D. M. A. OR G. S. M.
I THINK MAYBE IN C. D. M. A. IT MAY BE M C. D. M. A. IS MORE LIKE
MORE TIME DOMAIN
THE THEY THEY ARE C DOING ONLY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT YOU KNOW REALLY THE THESE LONG LINE TELEPHONES THEY ALREADY HAVE DELAY NO
AT LEAST HALF A SECOND OR YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT MOBILE M
AND THIS ONE IS
UH HARMONICS AND THE
YEAH
AND THEN PICKING YEAH
YEAH
BUT MAYBE THE BIT RATE IS THE PROBLEM NO
LIKE WHAT DAVID WAS DOING
LIKE IT'S REALLY UH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN JUST SEE HOW MANY HOW MANY HARMONICS
HE WAS USING TWENTY I THINK
LIKE YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN TRY TO REDUCE
YEAH
YEAH
AND THE F
AND THEN ALL THIS AMPLITUDE
AH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
EACH AGAIN
SOME KIND OF LINEAR YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SOME FUNCTION OR LIKE A
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
OH
YEAH
THE SIZE OF THE
BUT YOU DON'T DO ANY VOICE UN VOICE DECISION NO
YEAH THE THAT'S EVEN ADVANTAGE I THINK FOR THIS APPROACH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SORTA THE MODELLING IT'S REALLY ANOTHER ISSUE LIKE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO COMBINE ALL THIS HARMONIC MODEL AND NOISE MODEL
SO AGAIN YOU MAY END UP SOME
'CAUSE
OH OKAY
THE PE PEAK UH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
S
YEAH
YEAH
SO THAT'S A YOU HAVE TO TUNE LOT OF PARAMETERS LIKE I AM
BUT ANYWAY YOU DON'T REALLY NEED HARD DECISIONS NO
LIKE VOICED UNVOICED
SO M MAYBE IT MAY HELP YOU BUT IT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
BUT DO YOU REALLY REALLY NEED IT OR LIKE VOICED UNVOICED
YEAH BUT YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY YOU NEED T YOU DON'T NEED TO SPECIFY AT EACH POINT IT'S VOICED OR YEAH
HUH
YEAH
AND THEN AMPLITUDE
BUT YOU'RE TELLING EVEN FREQUENCY'S ALSO SHIFTING NO
LIKE YOUR DELAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SO THEN YEAH THEN IT'S NOT EXACTLY AMPLITUDE MODULATIONS OR IT'S IT'S IN BETWEEN MAYBE
YEAH
S YEAH
SO YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S WHAT MARIUS DID NO LIKE
BUT BUT HE WAS KEEPING ALL THE PHASE INFORMATION
NO BUT EVEN THE HIS CODED LIKE HE JUST HE HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING HE JUST TRANSFERRED IT THAT WAY
HE WAS AIMING FOR HE'S NOT REALLY KIND OF DOING SPEECH CODING BUT HE WANT TO DO IT ON MUSIC
SO HE DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE BAND WIDTHS OR HE WANT TO HAVE THE QUALITY NO LIKE
YEAH BUT EVEN ESPECIALLY THE AUDIO SERIES AND THE THAT THAT'S WHAT HE WAS TELLING LIKE
YEAH AT LEAST EVEN TEN K. BIT
TWENTY KILO BITS ALSO IS OKAY
SO BUT HE'S UH HE'S NOT I THINK FINISHED WITH ALL THAT THING
HE'S JUST TRANSMITTING ALL THE PHASE AND THEN BUT HE'S ENCODING THE ENVELOPE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN LEAVING THE PHASE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH OR
AUTO CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND
YEAH THEY AGAIN GIVE THE PHASE
YEAH AGAIN GIVE THE PHASE
YEAH
OH
HMM
BUT THIS PHASE IS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR CARRIER NO
LIKE YEAH
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DOING ON UH YOUR UH YEAH
AND ALSO LIKE YEAH
AND
YEAH
HMM
BUT EVEN YOU CAN USE AS A CAN YOU USE THAT PHASE DIRECTLY
WHEREAS THE D YEAH THIS ONE IS DIRECT
BUT THIS IS PHASE OF YOUR D UH SPECTRUM NO
LIKE IT'S NOT IN TIME DOMAIN
SO
OF YOUR SIGNAL
IT'S NOT SO THEN IT'S BIT TRICKY
LIKE HOW
OKAY BUT STILL YOU GET ONLY THE THE MAGNITUDE OF YOUR HILBERT ENVELOPE
YOU WON'T GET THE
NO BUT YOU STARTED WITH HIL HILBERT ENVELOPE NO
LIKE MAGNITUDE OF HILBERT ENVELOPE
MAGNITUDE OF UH NO BEFORE D. C. T. YOUR D OH
YEAH
AH OK SO INPUT TO THE D. C. T. IS THE SPEECH OR LIKE YOUR YEAH OKAY
JUST YOU'RE STARTING WITH
AH
AH
OK OK OK
YEAH MAYBE THE THEN
YEAH
AH OKAY
YEAH IT'S IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN NO
YEAH DEFINITELY IT'S D
BUT NOW I THINK PEOPLE
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHEN IS YOUR TURN
UH
OH
OH OKAY
I MEAN JUST BEFORE
OH YOU
LOW BIT RATE
YES
YEAH
HMM
HMM
HMM
OH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YOU KNOW THE THE
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
UH
NO NO NO YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT'S MOSTLY LIKE THIS IS UH S CELP AND THESE THING
NO I WAS T UH DOING SOME UH LIKE WRITING SOME CODE FOR TESTING AND THESE THINGS WHERE I'M MAKING SOME T STANDARDS FOR THAT
SO SO TH TH THERE ARE LIKE LI THE THING THESE STANDARDS
HOW IT WORKS IS LIKE THEY GIVE ALL THE PSEUDO CODE KIND OF THING AND THEN THEY PUT SEVERE TEST CONDITIONS
SO YOU HAVE TO PASS THOSE TEST CONDITIONS
LIKE THEN J YOU CAN SAY OKAY WE IMPLEMENTED D. SEVENTY EIGHT OR D. SE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY EVEN THE T STANDARDS THEY GIVE THE TEST SIGNALS ALSO
YOU ARE T YOU CAN'T REALLY DO IT ON WHATEVER DATABASE YOU HAVE
SO SO YOU ARE TO USE THE UH UH YEAH
UH IT YEAH IT'S MORE LIKE UH THEY DEFINE
SO I DID FOR SOME EVEN ALSO
THEY'RE ALSO THEY DEFINE ALL THIS THE SPEECH CONDITION
EVERYTHING THEY DEFINE
SO YOU NEED TO FOLLOW ALL THOSE
YES THIS INDUSTRY IS AGAIN DIFFERENT LIKE YEAH
YEAH I THINK THERE ISN'T ONLY SE MOST YEAH
AH
CELP IS FROM UH A. T. AND T. NO
LIKE A. T. AND YEAH YEAH
IT THE ALL THIS L. P. C. STUFF IS
YEAH
AH OK
AH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THE
YEAH THAT'S THE MAIN THING EVEN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH LIKE I
VOICE OVER I. P. OR YEAH
UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND AGAIN LOT OF THIS STUFF LIKE WHE EVEN WHEN I WAS WORKING MOSTLY THAT COMPANY WAS DEVELOPING FOR VOICE OVER I. P.
SO THEY'RE TO PUT ALL THESE THINGS ON AGAIN D. S. P. S
AND ALSO IT'S MOSTLY LIKE HOW TO HOW MANY L. P. C. S ARE YEAH HOW MANY CO YEAH IT'S OPTIMATION AND THEN IT'S EVEN
YEAH
AGAIN NOW NOW NOW EVEN THEY'RE ALSO BECOMING YEAH
EVEN THE MEMORIES ARE NOT REALLY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO EVEN I THINK UH THEN YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER BAND WIDTH IS
IT'S SHORT REALLY
BUT NO I THINK UH BUT STILL THEN THAT'S WHAT MAYBE PEOPLE ARE GOING TOWARD SIGN SORT OF MODELLING NO
LIKE I WAS BEFORE WHEN THE BANDWIDTH CONDITIONS WERE REALLY STRINGENT THEN THEY WERE USING ALL THE P L. P. C. BASED SOURCE FILTER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IF YOU WANT YOU CAN LOOK AT HIS CODE AND
BUT ONLY TH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT DEFINITELY IT'S BETTER THAN CO CODED SPEECH NO
DIFFERENT
YEAH IT'S REALLY BUT UH HOW MUCH YOU CAN GET THE COMPRESS THESE LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TELLING IS YOU CAN DO ALL THESE TRICKS LIKE
YEAH THESE YEAH
IN YEAH
WELL YEAH I READ UH I REVIEWED ONE PAPER LIKE YEAH THE THAT'S THAT'S FROM NO
YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK AT DATES FROM UH YOU KNOW EAST OF UH EAST UH YEAH EAST ANGLIA
YEAH
UH THIS UH E EAST UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA BEN MILNER
YEAH
I YEAH IT'S YEAH I CAN FORWARD YOU THAT
THEY'RE DOING LOT OF TRICKS
THEY'RE LIKE THEY'RE AGAIN TRAINING GAUSSIAN MIXTURES FOR DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES AND THEN BUT THEY CAN THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO NO THE THOSE THINGS ARE AGAIN BASED ON L. P. C. NO
LIKE MAINLY LIKE YEAH
WHEREAS LIKE THE PITCH ESTIMATION IN IN THE X. WAVES OR THESE THINGS THEY'RE ALL DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING BASED ON AGAIN L. P. C. ANALYSIS
YEAH
AND THEN CONSTRUCT THAT
HUH
YEAH AGAIN LIKE UH NO THE PROBLEM IS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY
LIKE THESE GUYS WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR DISTRIBUTOR SPEECH RECOGNITION MAINLY THIS UH SO
UH YEAH M. F. C. C. S
SO
NO IT'S E. T. S. A. OR SOMETHING
EUROPEAN STANDARD YEAH HYNEK REALLY N YEAH EVEN IT'S H KIND OF AURORA FRAMEWORK
SO YEAH
NO BUT NOW IT'S BIT
YEAH NOW THEY'RE
AND THEN YEAH M. F. C. S
BUT EVEN AT DISTANT POINT THEY'RE PLANNING TO USE FOR J UH STANDARD D. S. M. OR D. S. IT'S NOT
OR
YEAH
E. UH E. T. S. A. I. YEAH
EUROPEAN YEAH COMMISSION
SO
M YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I YEAH ALL THESE STANDARDS ARE REALLY OKAY
YEAH
BUT
YEAH
BUT THE QUALITY AGAIN PROBLEM NO LIKE
NO NO
THE THE EU AGAIN EUROPEAN STANDARD WHAT THIS GIVE US THEY GIVE THE M. F. C. C. S AND THEY GIVE THE PITCH
THEN YOU ARE TO CONSTRUCT THE THING
BUT IF HAVE M. F. C. C. S THEN LIKE AGAIN YOU HAVE TO GET THE HIGH ORDER M. F. C. C. S AND THEN YEAH THEN YOU'RE HAVE TO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
MM
YEAH
BUT I THINK AGAIN IT'S DIFFERENT NO
LIKE THESE STANDARDS AGAIN ALL THESE G. S. M. STANDARDS
MAYBE THEY HAVE THE COMPRESSION STANDARDS AND AGAIN CODING STAND BUT MAYBE UH I I READ AH YEAH
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE YEAH THEY'RE DOING YEAH COMBI YEAH THE EVEN EVEN G. EVEN NORMAL G. SEVENTY NINE NORMAL SPEECH CODER
SO THEY HAVE THE SPEECH CODING STANDARDS AGAIN
THEY ARE THESE CHANNEL CODING
SO YEAH
SO IT'S MM
YEAH B
MAYBE
YEAH
YEAH
AGAIN YEAH I
SO OKAY
YEP
TH THANK YOU THEN
OH
YOU CAN WRITE ON THE PAPER YEAH
IT'S IT'S OKAY
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
MM-HMM
HMM
OKAY
I HAVE A QUESTION
IS THE SCALE LINEAR OR IS MEL SCALE LIKE IN M. F. C. C.
IS IT BAR SCALE LIKE IN LIKE IN SP YEAH OKAY
THE OVERLAPPING IS DIFFERENT RIGHT
YEP
MM
OKAY AND
OKAY
UH UH
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
YEAH TRI BAND G. S. M. YEAH
DIFFERENT FREQUENCY
YEAH EXACTLY
MM-HMM
OKAY
TRUE
MM
MM-HMM
I'VE NEVER DONE ANY CODING IN MY LIFE
SO I JUST HAVE ONE CURIOSITY
SO THIS IS CODING THEN S YOU CODE THE SPEECH THEN YOU'RE ALSO SUPPOSED TO TRANSMIT THE SPEECH RIGHT
TH LET'S SAY IN G. S. M. OR SOMETHING ELSE
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS DOING SOME IMAGE PROCESSING THERE WERE TECHNIQUES FOR COMPRESSING AND THEN CODING
SO ADDING CHANNEL INFORMATION ON THE IMAGE AT THE SAME TIME IN ORDER TO SAVE SOUND BITS
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
EXACTLY
I D WAS JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S SOME S SOMEONE WAS DOING IT WITH SPEECH AS WELL
WELL ACTUALLY WHEN YOU COMPRESS YEAH ALL LIKE FIRST YOU COMPRESS THE SIGNAL RIGHT
AND THEN YOU AL YOU ADD COM SOME COMPLEXITY TO THE SIGNAL IN ORDER TO RECOVER THE ERROR
SO I WAS WONDERING IF BY ANY CHANCE THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN SPEECH WITH THE SPEECH
YOU DON'T KNOW
OKAY
WELL IT'S NOT THE MOST DIFFICULT RIGHT
SURE SURE
AND AND THIS WAS THE PROBLEM ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU WERE
NO NOT NOT IN G. S. M. DEFINITELY DEFINITELY NOT
UH
OKAY
THEN TH THEY SOME YOU KNOW SOURCE
SO YEAH
OKAY
JUST ONE
YEAH
DEFINITELY
IS IT GOOD
OKAY
OKAY THANK YOU
OH MY GOD
YEAH
OKAY
I SHOULD START
YEAH
NO SO I THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT S T SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SPEECH CODING BECAUSE NOBODY IS DOING HERE SPEECH CODING AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME MAYBE FEEDBACK BECAUSE EXCEPT ME
I'VE I'VE SUPPOSED TO SOME SPEECH CODING STUFF HERE WITH HYNEK UH BUT YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE BIT AT LEAST THAT UH BASED ON SOME LET'S SAY HILBERT TRANSFORMS USING A LONGER TEMPORAL CONTEXT AND DERIVING SOME PARAMETERS WOULD BE TRANF TRANSCS TRANSMITTED TO A DECODER AND
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE STUFF WHICH PEOPLE ARE USING NOW WHICH IS LIKE A L. P. C. BASED
AND BUT WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING WITH EVERYTHING MORE OR LESS
SO STILL UM WE CAN'T UH D ENCODE A SPEECH
BUT OF COURSE THERE IS THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS WHICH WE STILL DIDN'T SOLVE AND THE BIGGEST ONE IS QUITE SIMILAR TO L. P. C. STUFF WHERE PEOPLE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXACTLY ENCODE A CARRIER OR THE SOURCE SIGNAL
WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE ENVELOPE OR HOW TO APPROXIMATE THE ENVELOPE LET'S SAY
UM WHEN YOU HAVE GOT
OH YOU MEAN THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO PLOT AT LEAST S
UM MAYBE I I CAN I CAN
SO WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW YEAH YOU MEAN
OKAY I UH EVERYBODY KNOWS L. P. C. STUFF HOW IT WORKS
SO I DON'T HAVE TO PRESENT ANYTHING MORES
BUT IT'S UH M MORE OR LESS VERY SIMPLE
WE HAVE LET'S SAY AT THE BEGINNING THERE IS SOME SPEECH SIGNAL
WHAT WE ARE UH WE MIGHT SEE IT UH IN VERY SIMPLE WAY THAT WE ARE USING SOME HILBERT TRANSFORM H AT THE BEGINNING TO CREATE ANALYTIC SIGNAL
THE ANALYTIC SIGNAL IS THE SIGNAL WHICH IS A COMPLEX WHICH YOU CAN CREATE FROM THE UH REAL UH UH SOME SEQUENCE
AND IF YOU GET IF YOU APPLY HILBERT TRANSFORM ON THIS ON SUCH A SPEECH SIGNAL LIKE A REAL TRAJECTORY
THEN YOU GET A COMPLEX SIGNAL AND IF YOU TAKE JUST THE AMPLITUDE THEN YOU GET HILBERT ENVELOPE CODE
SO I WELL I I DON'T KNOW
YEAH LET'S SAY UPS
YEAH IT'S U IT'S NOT P. L. P. AT ALL D
MM
NO HE'S IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
UH YOU'RE LIT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN WITH THE PU P. L. P.
THEY ARE APPLYING P. L. P. WITH SOME ITERATION WITH THIS THIS ONE APPROACH
SO THEY ARE DOING SOME SMOOTHING OF A SPECTROGRAM IN TWO WAYS
ONE WAS RIGHT
RIGHT
BUT P. L. P. IS USING JUST THE SPECTRAL UH DIRECTION
LET'S SAY YOU ARE DOING UH FOR EVERY TWENTY MILLISECOND PROCESSING ONE ONE FEATURE VECTOR
HERE YOU ARE PROCESSING ONE SPECTRAL BAND FREQUENCY BAND RIGHT
SO IT'S DIFFERENT DIRECTION WHICH WE ARE W USING
BUT ANYWAY THIS IS VERY SIMPLE
SO APPLYING THAT UH ABSOLUTE UH ABSOLUTE OPERATION YOU GET A HILBERT ENVELOPE
AND OF COURSE THEN THERE IS THE PHASE
SO IT'S JUST THE COMPLEX OPERATION
AND THAT'S MORE OR LESS ALL WHAT WE ARE DOING
SO NOW WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW IS HOW TO APPROXIMATE THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE
WE ARE AP WE ARE APPLYING THAT HILBERT UH HIM WHAT IS THE MARIUS' UH STUFF
SO HE KNOWS HOW TO ENCODE UH THE HILBERT UH ENVELOPE USING LIKE L. S. F. S OR L. P. C.
YOU ARE APPLYING AGAIN TO SOME LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL AFTER THAT
BUT IT'S UH RIGHT IT'S IN A IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENCE IN NOT APPLIED IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
SO INSTEAD OF CLASSICAL L. P. C. DOMAIN WHERE YOU HAVE A SPECTRUM LET'S SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND YOU ARE APPLYING SOME LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL WHICH IS TRYING TO APPROXIMATE THE SPECTRUM RIGHT
SO THIS IS FREQUENCY
IN OUR CASE WE ARE WE ARE TRYING TO APPROXIMATE S KIND OF INSTANTANEOUS ENERGY
SO IF THIS IS A TIME AND YOU GET ONE AND ADD ONE FREQUENCY BAND YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AND WE ARE TRYING TO APPROXIMATE THAT ENVELOPE WHICH IS
THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE
RIGHT
SO AGAIN WE KNOW WHAT TO MORE OR LESS WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE HILBERT ENVELOPE
WE KNOW THAT WE CAN APPLY LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL AND IT WORKS PRETTY WELL
BUT I IF YOU WANT TO REALLY CONSTRUCT THE SPEECH SIGNAL OR THE YOU NEED ALSO THE PHASE SIGNAL
WHICH IS IN UH SOME SENSE QUITE SIMPLE FOR VOICED SPEECH SIGNAL SAY
BUT S UH THE PHASE NO YOU AC IT'S A PHASE OR YOU CAN ENCODE IT LIKE A CARRIER
SO THE CARRIER IS IF YOU KNOW UH AMPLITUDE MODULATION RIGHT
YOU MAY SEE SOMETHING LIKE THERE IS ONE COSINE WHICH IS UH VERY WOULD HAVE QUITE A F RIGHT
YEAH
IT'S CALLED LIKE THE PHASE
RIGHT RIGHT
EXACTLY
SO THE THIS IS THE SIGNAL WHICH YOU ALSO HAVE TO SOMEHOW ENCODE OR TRANSMIT FROM A CODE OF THE DECODER IN ORDER TO RE SYNTHESIZE IT RIGHT
SO
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
AGAIN
FOR THIS ONE
FOR THE THE LINEAR PREDICTION MODEL
WELL IT'S UH JUST A LINEAR PREDICTION
CLASSICAL WAY
I MEAN OH OKAY W WELL IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT IN MORE DETAILS I MEAN
OH YOU MEAN UH YEAH BIT BIT RATE YOU MEAN
OKAY YEAH
SURE SURE
SO WHEREAS WE ARE WHAT WE ARE NOW IS LET'S SAY SOMETHING LIKE ONE POINT TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND FOR UH THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE
IS
IT'S AGAIN A ROUGHLY ESTIMATED SOMEHOW
BUT WE STILL KNOW THAT WE CAN GO DOWN AND RIGHT
EXACTLY YEAH
I DON WE ARE USING LIKE FIFTEEN BANDS
RIGHT
BUT THEY ARE FIRST THEY ARE INTER OH WELL INTEGRATED INTO FIFTEEN BANDS USING OH CLASSICAL WAY LIKE IN M. F. C. C. S OR IN P. L. P.
YOU JUST APPLY SOME THOSE UH TRIANGULAR WINDOWS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN ORDER TO TO GET A LI REALLY LIKE JUST FIFTEEN BANDS RIGHT
AND EACH BAND IS THEN PROCESSED INDEPENDENTLY
SO FOR ONE BAND WE MORE OR LESS HAVE W LIKE W ONE HUNDRED BITS PER SECOND
FOR HILBERT ENVELOPE
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
YOU YEAH YOU CAN JUST RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH
UH RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE DID
YEAH SURE
SURE SURE
YEAH
THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE WOULD WOULDN'T AT ALL
BUT YEAH EXACTLY
BUT NOW WHAT I R REALLY TRYING TO DO IS SOMEHOW APPROXIMATE THAT UH CARRIER SIGNAL TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE CARRIER
THERE ARE MANY SIMPLE THINGS WHICH YOU CAN DO LIKE UH QUANTIZATION QUANTIZATION FOR EXAMPLE
RIGHT
YOU MEAN SOMETHING LIKE UH F UH THAT CELP CODING SYSTEM WHERE YOU'RE OR WH WH WH WHAT IS NO WHAT IS EXACTLY SCALABLE SYSTEM
WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT
OH YEAH YEAH SURE
THIS WAS YEAH
FOR DIF YEAH RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
BUT I THINK THIS APPR APPROACH CAN DO THAT BECAUSE YOU REALLY CAN SPLIT IT INTO SEVERAL BANDS
AND YOU CAN DECIDE HOW MANY BANDS YOU WANT MORE OR LESS
SO
YEAH THIS IS A BAR SCALE WE ARE USING
YEAH OR MEL MEL SCALE SO IT'S UH IT'S BEING UH MORE WIDER FOR HIGHER FREQUENCIES AND OF COURSE THE S THE SPACES RIGHT
YEAH
BUT WHAT I W MY SENSE IS THAT IT IS NOT SO MUCH IMPORTANT STILL
I MEAN IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE ALS USE MEL SCALE OR BAR SCALE
BUT RIGHT YEAH
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE USING YEAH
UH ACTUALLY WE ARE USING JUST GAUSSIAN WINDOWS HERE INSTEAD OF THOSE TRIANGULARS BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE UH NO
IT'S BETTER THAN FOR DECODING IT'S BETTER TO PLAY WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE NOT ZERO ANYWHERE YOU KNOW
THEY ARE THEY ARE APPROACHING OR IN THEY ARE IN ZERO
BUT ACTUALLY THEY ARE NOT
SO D YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT SOME ZERO VALUES HERE AND BUT MORE OR LESS IT DOESN'T MATTER YEAH
WE ARE USING JUST GAUS GAUSSIAN WINDOWS
OKAY SO L THOSE ARE THAT THE HILBERT ENVELOPE IS UM IS APPROXIMATED BY LINEAR PREDICTION
SO YOU HAVE L. P. C. COEFFICIENTS WHICH YOU CAN TRANSCRIBE INTO L. L. L. S. F. S WHICH ARE RIGHT EXACTLY
YEAH
RIGHT EXACTLY
SO FIRST UH THE APPROACH IS QUITE SIM SIMPLE
SO AT THE BEGINNING WE APPLY D. C. T. IN ORDER TO GET TO FREQUENCY DOMAIN
THEN YOU APPLY THOSE UH TRIANGULAR OR GAUSSIAN WINDOWS
SO THIS IS DONE FOR ONE SECOND EIGHT THOUSAND SAMPLES FOR EIGHT KILO HERTZ SAMPLING FREQUENCY RIGHT
SO FOR SUCH D. C. T. TRAJECTORY YOU APPLY THOSE UH GAUSSIAN WINDOWS
AND THEN I SO YOU SPLIT IT IN TWO FREQUENCY SUB BANDS
AND THEN EACH ONE F FREQUENCY SUB BAND IS MORE OR LESS UH
RIGHT
RIGHT
EXACTLY
YOU JUST APPLY L. L. P. SO AUTO CORRELATION LET'S SAY OR YOU CAN DO POWER SPECTRUM WHATEVER
YEAH SO YOU FOR EACH ONE YOU GET L. S. F. S HERE
UH WELL I'M USING NOW LIKE TWENTY L. S. F. S PER ONE SECOND PER ONE FREQUENCY BAND
FIFTEEN
NO NO
IF I JUST KEEP ALL THEM SO TWENTY L. S. F. S EACH ONE IS UM
IS QUANTIZED BY FOUR OR FIVE BITS
OF WHAT
THREE HUNDRED BITS
TWO
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
EXACTLY
YOU MEAN THIS PHASE THE THE HILBERT CARRIER
OR NO OF COURSE WE DID
YEAH
UH W WELL THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO
WE DON'T WELL THE FIRST THING WHAT YOU CAN REALLY DO IS JUST TO REPLACE IT BY GAUSSIAN NOISE
SO YOU CAN REALLY USE T LIKE IN UH L. P. C. SYSTEM
RIGHT
EXACTLY
OR YOU CAN REPLACE IT BY SOME COSINE ONE COSINE GENERATED IN A CEN CENTRE FREQUENCY OF THAT GAUSSIAN WINDOW
RIGHT
YEAH
IT MI IT MI YEAH
TWELVE HUNDRED
YEAH
YEAH IT'S POSSIBLE SOME OF IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
R RIGHT
WELL I'M JUST COMPARING WITH UH L. P. C. TEN STANDARD WHICH IS LIKE CLASSICAL L. P. C.
A LITTLE BIT OPTIMIZED
SO THERE IN THE THERE IS I THINK TWO POINT FOUR KILO BITS PER SECOND THE BIT RATE FOR THAT
YEAH DEFINITELY
THIS IS NO UH I MEAN L. P. C. TEN IS JUST L. P. C.
NO NO NO
NO
JUST NOISE OR JUST THOSE IMPULSES
CELP
YEAH THERE YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
FOUR POINT EIGHT OR SOMETHING
RIGHT
YEAH SURE
WELL MORE OR LESS WHAT WE DIDN'T DO IS ANALYSIS BY SYNTHESIS RIGHT
SO THAT'S WHAT CELP IS DOING RIGHT
SO YEAH SO THIS IS WHAT WE DO AND UH THAT MIGHT HELP A LOT OF COURSE
BUT W YEAH EXACTLY
THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION
IT WILL BE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH SURE
FOR EXAMPLE UH THERE WHAT I ALSO DID WAS UH A SIMPLE PEAK PEAKING ALGORITHM
SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK ON THAT SPECTRUM OF THAT OF THAT CARRIER SIGNAL
WHICH IS MORE OR LESS LIKE THE COSINE IF YOU REALLY TAKE A LOOK ON THAT
BUT IT IS KIND OF FREQUENCY SHIFTED COSINE OR FREQUENCY MODULATED COSINE
RIGHT SO IT'S TH THE FREQUENCY STILL TO BE CHANGING
OR OF COURSE THE AMPLITUDE IS JUST NOT CONSTANT ALL TIME
IT SHOULD BE THEORETICALLY
BUT PRACTICALLY IT'S NOT
SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE FOR A ONE SECOND SIGNAL YOU M MORE OR LESS YOU ALREADY MIGHT SEE SOME LIKE ONE
ONE UH IMPULSE THERE OR SPECTRAL LINE FOR
BUT USUALLY THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHICH ARE S QUITE SMALL BUT THEY ARE QUITE IMPORTANT
IF YOU DON'T TRANSMIT THEM THEN THE SIGNAL IS QUITE ROBOTIC OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO IF YOU'RE REALLY TRANSMITTING JUST ONE SPECTRAL LINE
BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND PRETTY WELL
THE SIGNAL IS AUDIBLE
OR IF YOU'RE ADJUST UH TH FIND ONE ONE LINE
ONE SPEAKER AND DOM DOM DOMINANT ONE IN THE SPECTRUM OF THAT C UH CARRIER HIL HILBERT CARRIER AND YOU JUST TRANSMIT THIS PARAMETER
NO N
IT'S EVEN EASIER BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST DIVIDE THE YOU JUST MULTIPLY THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE BY THE TABLE CARRIER
THAT THAT'S ALL
YEAH YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
SO SO YOU JUST MULTIPLY THAT UH ONE HILBERT CARRIER WHICH IS TRANSCRIBED BY L. S. F. S BY THAT THIS ONE I. F. F. T. SIGNAL
SO
OH F YOU MEAN THE PHASE OF THAT UH OF THAT CARRIER
OF OF COURSE I TRY TO PLAY ALSO WITH THAT
AND UH I FOUND THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH WHICH WHAT IS THE PHASE BECAUSE WE ARE USING JUST ONE SECOND WINDOW RIGHT
SO OF COURSE THERE THERE MIGHT BE UH SOME UH DISTURB UH DISTURBED UH WHEN YOU CONCATENATE THOSE SEGMENTS TOGETHER
BUT THEN THE PHASE MIGHT BE IMPORTANT
BUT OTHERWISE I MEAN I DIDN'T FIND ANY ANYTHING IMPORTANT WITH THE PHASE
LIKE GREAT KEEP THE PHASE ZERO AND IT WORKS
OR
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
BUT IT'S AGAIN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE I THEY ARE DOING THIS IN A FREQUENCY DOMAIN
BUT THIS IS IN TIME DOMAIN MORE OR LESS
RIGHT
THE SPECTROGRAM YOU MEAN
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
EXACTLY
WHAT WE CAN ALSO DO VERY SIMPLE IS JUST TO GET THE MAGNITUDE SPECTROGRAM USING THIS APPROXIMATION WITHOUT THE CARRIER JUST HILBERT ENVELOPE
BUT YOU JUST UH GET IT IN IN THIS WAY IN IN THE WAY OF ROB'S RIGHT
BUT YOU CAN ALSO GET THE S SHORT TIME FOURIER TRANSFORM UH AND KEEP IT RIGHT
JUST CLASSICAL UH FRAME BY FRAME ALGORITHM TWENTY MILLISECONDS
UH BUT YOU KEEP JUST THE PHASES INSTEAD OF MAGNITUDES
AND YOU CAN PUT THIS TOGETHER RIGHT
AND IT WORKS PRETTY WELL AND THEN THE SIGNAL IS NOT UH JUST UH WHISPERED
THEN YOU REALLY HEAR THAT THERE IS THE VOICENESS IN THE SIGNAL
BUT UH OF COURSE THE QUALITY IS UH IS NOT SO GOOD STILL
BUT UH YOU CAN USE IT FOR LIKE TWO THREE KILO BITS PER SECOND AND IT WORKS
LIKE YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH SURE
ANYWAY
SO UM HMM M MAYBE IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU T IF YOU TELL US UH WHAT YOU DO WITH THE SPEECH CODING 'CAUSE I D I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF P. H. D. S OF YOU
I THINK
SO IF YOU DID SOMETHING SO MAYBE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING AT LEAST TO
YEAH
YEAH SURE
IT'S TRUE
SO YOU WERE WHEN WHEN DID YOU DO THAT
OH OKAY
UH-HUH
I THINK SO YEAH
YOU MEAN USING THAT UH C. D. M. A.
OR
YEAH IT'S NOT G. S. M.
RIGHT IT'S UH KIND OF S NO C. D. M. A. IS UH ANOTHER LEVEL I THINK
MM-HMM
I THINK THERE IS A L LOT OF MONEY IN THAT LIKE RIGHT
LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION OF COURSE IT'S VERY INTERESTING BUT PEOPLE DON'T USE IT SO MUCH AS S JUST CODING JUST TELEPHONING RIGHT OR JUST
RIGHT
YEAH
THEY S YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
NO I I
WELL WHAT WE WERE WHAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IS OH C. D. M. A. I MEAN THERE IS THE B
WELL THE PROBLEM IS THIS IN WITH THIS APPLICATION
OR IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PROBLEM BUT ONE CONSTRAINT IS THAT WE ARE PROCESSING ONE SECOND OF THE SIGNAL
YOU CAN GO DOWN OF COURSE
BUT THEN YOU ARE LOSING LITTLE BIT OF THE BIT RATE LET'S SAY RIGHT
SO BUT THERE ARE MANY APPLICATIONS WHERE YOU REALLY CAN USE IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ALGORITHMIC DELAY ONE SECOND ALGORITHMIC DELAY
LIKE FOR I DON'T KNOW IF INSTEAD OF S. M. S. YOU CAN REALLY HAVE SOME CHANNEL WHERE YOU JUST RIGHT
UM SO PROBABLY
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
YEP
RIGHT
WHAT IF S
WHICH ONE S OH
WELL
BUT THE SINUSOIDAL CODING IS USUALLY M WHEN YOU S AT LEAST WHAT I THINK OR UH WHAT I KNOW IS WHEN YOU ARE DOING SINUSOIDAL CODING IT MEANS YOU JUST TAKE THE SPEECH SIGNAL AT THE BEGINNING
RIGHT
AND YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND TO UH YEAH TO FIND THE HARMONICS IN A TEMPORAL DOMAIN RIGHT FOR THAT
RIGHT
OH
YEAH
RIGHT
MORE OR LESS I DID IT MAYBE DIFFERENT WAY BUT KIND OF ALGORITHM LIKE OKAY
TRYING TO FIND OUT THE STRONGEST OR THE THE MOST DOMINANT PEAKS IN THE SPECTRUM WHICH IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME
BUT TH
BUT YOU KNOW THE THE F THE INTERESTING
RIGHT
RIGHT AND THAT THAT'S IT
AND THEN YOU DO MULTIPLES OF RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE IT
IF IT IS UNWRAP YOU MEAN
UNWRAP UH PHASE
RIGHT
YOU L RIGHT YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I ALSO PLAY WITH THAT
AND FOR EXAMPLE WHAT I FOUND I WELL IN THIS CASE UH WE ARE NOT TRYING TO ENCODE THE SPEECH SIGNAL
WE ARE TRYING TO ENCODE SOME CARRIER WHICH IS MUCH EASIER I WOULD SAY BECAUSE YOU CAN REALLY IM YOU CAN SEE THAT EVEN
SO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ENCODE AT THE PHASES SO I JUST FOUND THAT UH TWO BITS IS ENOUGH FOR THAT AND YOU REALLY DON'T HEAR THE DIFFERENCE
SO IF YOU KEEP ALL THE SPECTRAL LINES AS THEY WERE THERE BUT YOU WERE JUST UH QUANTIZING WITH TWO BITS OR THREE BITS FOR AMPLITUDE
TWO BITS FOR FOR PHASE
SO IT'S OKAY
THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE TO TRANSMIT MANY OF THEM
'CAUSE THERE IS NOT JUST ONE DOMINANT COMPONENT BUT USUALLY MORE OTHERS WHICH ARE QUITE SMALL RIGHT
OR WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO THEN YOU HAVE TO DECREASE THE THE THE SIZE OF NOT ONE SECOND
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN GET JUST VOICED PART AND UNVOICED PART
YOU KNOW ONE SECOND IT'S USUALLY MIXED RIGHT SOMEHOW TOGETHER
NOT NOW NO
I WI
UH UH WE DON'T NO WANT TO DO THAT YEAH BECAUSE IT'S QUITE TRICKY
RIGHT
YEAH SURE
EXACTLY
RIGHT
BUT FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WE ALSO FOUND IS THAT IF YOU USE JUST THE HILBERT ENVELOPE
THAT THAT ONE WHICH IS TRYING TO APPROXIMATE THAT ENERGY IN SOME LOW BAND
LIKE AR AROUND TWO HUNDRED T UH HERTZ AND YOU TAKE A LOOK ON THE SIGNAL
ON THE TRAJECTORY YOU CAN SEE THAT IT WORKS LIKE KIND OF UM VOICE DETECTOR
BECAUSE UH FOR A LOW ENERGIES THERE IS USUALLY NOISE
FOR HIGH ENERGIES THERE IS KIND OF A HARMONICITY
SO IT WORKS PRETTY WELL FOR THAT
SO WE MIGHT USE THIS ONE INFORMATION FOR THAT
BUT
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH
MM-HMM
RIGHT
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM
SURE
UH F
THAT WOULD BE NICE N NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
MY
MM-HMM
RIGHT
EXACTLY
WELL I DON'T KNOW
MAYBE IF YOU WE UH REALLY WANT TO IMPROVE THE THE QUALITY THEN WE WILL NEED IT I DON'T KNOW STILL
N NOT NOW
YEAH UH WELL I'M GONNA T HAVE A TIME NEXT NEXT MONTH OR IN THREE WEEKS SO I'LL TRY TO PLAY SOME EXAMPLES THERE FOR YOU AND
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO RECONSTR
HOW DOES IT LOOK LIKE OR SURE
YEAH MORE OR LESS
IT'S KIND OF UH NOT FREQUENCY
LET'S SAY AMPLITUDE MODULATION WHEN YOU HAVE JU JUST THE CARRIER AND THAT MODULATION SIGNAL RIGHT
YEAH WE YEAH YEAH YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH YEAH
IT'S IN BETWEEN EXACTLY
SO IT'S NOT THIS AND THAT
BUT STILL YEAH
BUT ANYWAY WHAT ALSO THE OTHER APPROACH WHICH IS POSSIBLE TO USE
THE OTHER IS ONE TO KEEP THE PHASE LIKE THIS ONE LIKE TWO SPECTROGRAMS ONE THE PHASE AND ONE THE MAGNITUDE
AND WELL I CAN AGAIN PLAY IT AND IT WORKS ON TWO KILO BITS PER SECOND
QUITE WHAT UH NO WHAT UH HE WAS DOING HE WAS USING IT FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
WHAT I WHAT I KNOW BUT FOR SPEECH CODING NO NO NO IT WAS I DON'T KNOW
FOR SPEECH CODING YOU MEAN
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
M MAYBE
RIGHT
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL FOR EXAMPLE THIS PHASE INFORMATION RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
I THINK SO
THERE ARE M MORE PAPERS WHICH ARE USING THIS APPROACH LIKE TRYING TO ENCODE THE MAGNITUDE SPECTRUM OR SPECTROGRAM
UH THE PHASE OR YOU JUST UH RE CAN AGAIN THE PHASE CAN BE REPLACED BY THE NOISE WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD
SO THAT'S UH THE BENEFIT UH VARIABLE APPROACH
SO IF YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE A BAND WIDTH YOU JUST CAN REPLACE IT BY NOISE AND IT WORKS
OF COURSE THEN IT DOESN'T SOUND AS THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE IT'S MORE WHISPERED OR WHATEVER
BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WELL
AND FOR EXAMPLE UH IF YOU MENTION THIS ONE APPROACH WITH THE THAT UH TRAJECTORY OF THE PHASE
OF UNWRAP PHASE RECRE UH I ALSO USE BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT HERE WHEN YOU GET INTO UH THIS DOMAIN WHERE YOU APPLY UH OR YOU'RE TRYING TO COMPUTE UH S POWER SPECTRUM IN IN ORDER T LET'S SAY THAT THIS KIND OF TRAJECTORY
IT DOESN'T IN FIT THE SAME FREQUENCY OVER TIME DOMAIN
BUT HERE YOU ARE TRYING TO COMPUTE UH DOING A TO DO LINEAR PREDICTION
SO WE ARE JUST DOING F. F. T. RIGHT
THEN APPLYING UH POWER IN ORDER TO GET UM TO S TO POWER DOMAIN AND THEN I. F. F. T. RIGHT
SO YOU GET THE AUTO CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS
SO BEFORE YOU'RE APPLYING UH POWER SPECTRUM
YOU CAN AGAIN GET THE YOU HAVE GOT A COMPLEX F FREQ FREQUENCY OR COMPLEX SPECTRUM YOU CAN GET THE PHASE RIGHT
AND THE PHASE LOOK QUITE SIMILAR LIKE THIS
SO YOU MIGHT SEE IT'S IS MORE LESS LIKE A LINE
RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH IT'S IT IS VERY DIFFERENT YEAH
THEN YOU ARE DOING IN DIFFERENT DOMAIN
I THINK THIS IS IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN THIS IN TIME DOMAIN
UM IT IS QUITE IT'S QUITE SENSIBLE TO ANY QUANTIZATION WHAT I FOUND
REALLY IT LOOKS LIKE THE LINES
SO YOU JUST SAY OKAY LET'S P LET'S PUT THE LINE THERE
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK
RE WELL YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
BUT YOU CAN HERE THAT THERE ARE MANY ARTIFACTS WHICH RIGHT EXACTLY
RIGHT RIGHT
AND THE ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT UH IT'S NOT BAND WIDTH VARIABLE
SO YOU CANNOT SAY THAT THIS PART WILL BE THE JUST THE NOISE WHICH YOU CAN DO IN HERE IN THIS THIS OTHER APPROACH
SO THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T PLAY WITH THAT SO M MORE BECAUSE I FOUND THERE ARE MORE UH DISADVANTAGES THAN THE ADVANTAGES THIS APPROACH
SO THAT'S WHY
YOU MEAN THIS ONE
YEAH IF YOU TAKE JUST THE ORIGINAL PHASE AND THE
RIGHT
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT A PHASE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
IT'S THE PHASE NO YOU CAN AGAIN PUT THE THAT ENVELOPE WITH THIS PHASE TOGETHER BECAUSE ENVELOPE IS TWE
NO NO
YOU G NO YOU GET THE F
YEAH YOU GET THE COMPLEX COMPLEX SPECTRUM WITH THIS
NO NO I STARTED WITH THE D. C. T.
NO AFTER D. C. T. YOU ARE TRYING THIS IS SO KIND OF AGAIN A REAL TRAJECTORY RIGHT
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIRST FIND THAT HILBERT ENVELOPE
SO UH LET'S WELL SO THIS IS A SPEECH
NO BUT HERE WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS REALLY THAT Y IT'S NOT PART OF HILBERT ENVELOPE IT'S PART OF THE D. C. T. SIGNAL
SO IT'S NOT IT'S ENOUGH IF YOU HAVE JUST THIS PHASE AND F AND THE HILBERT ENVELOPE YOU CAN PUT IT TOGETHER
YOU DON'T NEED THE CARRIER
I MEAN THIS IS KIND OF A CARRIER SIGNAL BUT IN DIFFERENT DOMAIN REPRESENTED
RIGHT RIGHT
SO I WHAT I THINK IS THAT WE ALREADY WILL NEED TO APPLY S KIND OF ANALYSIS BY SYNTHESIS APPROACH MM UH IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING
RIGHT
WHAT I
NO
YOU MEAN YE
RIGHT
RIGHT RIGHT
YES THAT'S TRUE
BUT I MEAN THAT'S MAYBE EVEN THE ADVANTAGE HERE BECAUSE YOU IT'S NOT SPEECH D BASED WHICH MEANS WE ARE NOT
RIGHT
SO YOU CAN WHEN I TRIED AND COMPARING WITH L. P. C. TEN ON A UH TWICE BIGGER OR HIGHER BIT RATE THIS WORK WORKS BETTER IT SEEMS TO ME
JUST FOR UNVOICED SPEECH
O I'M NOT MENTIONING UH VOICELESS BECAUSE THAT'S UNVOICED WHICH MEANS WHISPERED
UH YEAH BUT UH WHEN YOU HEAR AND TRY TO USE SOME EXAMPLES WITH THE MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE
RIGHT YEAH
MM-HMM
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
UH BUT ANYWAY IT SEEMED TO ME PRETTY GOOD
I MEAN THAT THERE MIGHT BE
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
UH IT SHOULD BE UH THIRTEENTH DECEMBER I THINK
I JUST UH YOU WON'T BE HERE
UH OKAY
NO I JUST SWAPPED IT WITH UH MIKE PERROT I THINK 'CAUSE H HE IS NOT GOING TO BE HERE THIS TIME
AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE IT IN UH IN JANUARY
SO WHATEVER
ANYWAY
SO BUT ANYWAY I I WANTED TO HEAR SOMETHING MAYBE FROM YOU WHAT YOU ARE DOING F WITH SPEECH CODING BECAUSE YOU WERE YOU MENTIONED THAT
BY
BUT IT WAS BASED ON LIKE YOU WERE USING KIND OF RECOGNIZER THERE RIGHT
UH-HUH
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH IT'S I'M I MEAN YEAH IT'S DIFFERENT
BUT UH IT'S SPEECH CODING AT LEAST
I THINK SO
RIGHT
YEAH SURE
BAND YOU MEAN
RIGHT
WITH DIFFERENT
I DON'T KNOW
BUT MAYBE WHAT WE CAN ALREADY DO IS UH TO DECREASE THIS UH THIS DISTANCE
WE CAN DO A HILBERT ENVELOPE APPROXIMATION WITH ONE SECOND
BUT THEN WE CAN SPLIT THAT SIGNAL INTO I DON'T KNOW TEN TEN UH SEGMENTS WITH THE ONE HUNDRED MILLISECONDS OR EVEN LESS
AND WE CAN APPLY SOME OTHER TECHNIQUE FOR THAT YOU KNOW
STILL
RIGHT
EXACTLY EXACTLY
YEAH
WELL TH MORE LESS THEY DON'T CARE WHAT'S UH WHAT WILL BE THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE OR THE BIT RATE
THEY JUST WANT TO GET SOMETHING NEW YOU KNOW
SO IF YOU GET THE V VERY UH LOW BIT RATE WITH A REASONABLE QUALITY OR REALLY HIGH BIT RATE
WHICH IS C AGAIN DIFFERENT BUT WITH UH HIGH QUALITY UH THEY WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THE BOTH
SO YOU KNOW ON ONE SIDE IT'S PRETTY GOOD BUT ON THE OTHER YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY YOU SHOULD GO 'CAUSE THERE ARE MANY OF THEM
AND UH
RIGHT RIGHT
OKAY
WELL I I WILL
W UH DO YOU WANT TO MENTION YOUR SPEECH CODING EXPERIMENTS
SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING I IN INDIA WITH UH
SO YOU KNOW THE SUB MM LIKE UM MORE DETAILS
OH YEAH
OKAY
RIGHT RIGHT
RIGHT
I SEE
YEAH BUT IT'S QUITE INTERESTING WITH THE EVEN WITH TH UH S CURRENT SPEECH CODING UH TECHNOLOGIES
WE ARE THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO USE K ZAP OR THOSE R. P. BASED APPROACHES
THERE IS NOTHING NEW MORE OR LESS
AND IF I WHEN I WAS UH LISTENING THE UH THE TALK OF UH MILAN JELINEK UH HE'S THE CZECH GUY BUT HE LIVES IN UH IN CANADA
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE UNIVERSITY
BUT THEY THEY HAVE UH THE PATTERN I THINK FOR CELP EVEN
OR
UM I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS EXACTLY BUT THEY GOT VERY VERY FAMOUS FOR THIS FOR THAT CELP
WHAT THEY DID EXACTLY I DON'T KNOW IF SOMETHING DIFFERENT A LITTLE BIT OR NOT
OR THEY JUST KEEP THOSE PATTERNS OR I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS EXACTLY
MAYBE HYNEK WILL KNOW MUCH MORE
BUT UH WHEN I HEARD THOSE THAT PRESENTATION THEY DIDN'T DO SO MUCH NEW
I MEAN UH IT WAS LAST YEAR AND UH I THINK HYNEK
HE WAS ASKING WH SO WHAT'S NEW THAT YOU ARE SO FAMOUS WITH THAT AND THEY N THEY SAID OKAY WE WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT
I MEAN YOU KNOW NOT TO MAKE ANY ERRORS LIKE IN BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT
BUT UH IT'S NOT SO EASY TO IMPLEMENT IT RIGHT
SO UH THERE IS NOTHING SO MUCH NEW REALLY LIKE
YEAH
RIGHT
RIGHT
EXACTLY
RIGHT
RIGHT RI RIGHT EXACTLY EXACTLY
BUT THEN THEY ARE S STILL USING LIKE ERROR SIGNAL WHICH IS GOING TO BE APPROXIMATED BY CODE BOOK RIGHT
AND A LINEAR PREDICTION WHICH IS USE WHICH IS APPROXIMATING JUST THE SPECTRUM OF FOR FOR AND EVERYTHING THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALL
SO STILL
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
WELL I HOPE THAT WE STILL HAVE A A LOT OF TIME FOR THAT BECAUSE UH
I THINK YEAH IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING YEAH
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS UH YOU KNOW HARMONIC VOICE MODELLING THAT H. M. M. SYSTEM WHICH IS USING USED FOR SYNTHESIS MORE LESS
IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING
I MEAN IT IT WORKS IT WORKS WELL
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH YEAH IT IS
YOU MEAN UH IN SINUSOIDAL UH MODELLING
YEAH
AND BUT ANYWAY DO YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT IS DONE WHEN YOU REALLY HAVE THOSE M. F. C. C. COEFFICIENTS
WHICH MEANS MAGNITUDE SPECTRUM AND THEN YOU ARE TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT THE SPEECH
WITHOUT A PHASE
BECAUSE I I TRIED YOU KNOW THOSE TH THOSE PAPERS
BUT S I'M LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT IT
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS
BUT
WHICH ONE
YEAH THAT WOULD BE NICE
OH
YOU KNOW M BUT THERE ARE SOME ALGORITHMS WHICH WERE QUITE UH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
UH IT SEEMS TO ME YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
LIKE TRY
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO UM MAYBE
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS UH TAKE JUST THE MINIMUM PHASE OF WHICH YOU CAN GET FROM A LINEAR PREDICTION RIGHT
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN MINIMUM PHASE SIGNAL
AND IT SOUNDS QUITE UH REASONABLY THE TWO
BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE LI IT'S NOT ORIGINAL AT ALL
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT EXACTLY
NO I'VE NO IDEA
RIGHT
TRUE RIGHT
FOR N FOR AURORA WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THAT
YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T DO ANY SPEECH RECON RE RECONSTRUCTION
YEAH
YEAH YEAH SURE
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
YOU MEAN WITH THIS PHASE UH SURE
YEAH
YEAH THEY DO SOME KIND OF RECONSTRUCTION OF SPEECH
UH YEAH
RIGHT
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
SO
YEP
YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SURE YEAH
OKAY
SO HOW ABOUT YOU
YEAH
YEAH
YOU MEAN LIKE CHANNEL AND SOURCE CODING TOGETHER
OR NO
WELL I CAN IMAGINE KIND OF LIKE J. PEG OPERATIONS
WHICH MIGHT BE MORE LESS LIKE IT'S SOURCE CODING AND THEN WE ALSO CHANNEL CODING BECAUSE WE JUST SMOOTH THE OR JUST I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
R RIGHT RIGHT
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT S CHANNEL CODING LIKE THOSE HUFFMAN CODING STUFF AND YOU KNOW
I MEAN IT'S JUST STANDARD
YEAH
THEY'RE JUST STANDARD TECHNIQUES
BUT
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH YEAH
I THINK SO
H YEAH
END
OKAY
THANK YOU GUYS
UH IF YOU FIND SOME GOOD PAPER WHICH YOU MIGHT
THERE WAS THAT FAM FAM WAVEFORM PRO PROTOTYPING COR
THE SHOW MUST GO ON
YOU CAN SAY THEN YOU
IT I TH I THOUGHT IT WAS CALLED PAS SO I THINK JUST USE THIS
PAS
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
WELL I SUPPOSE UH I SUPPOSE THEY CAN CAPTURE THINGS RIGHT
I MEAN DON'T S I DON'T SEE WHY YOU COULD NOT CAPTURE THE VIDEOS I MEAN WITH A CARD LIKE THIS
I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW
WELL AS FAR AS I AS FAR AS I KNOW I MEAN THEY DO OF COURSE THEY CAN DO OF COURSE SLIDE DETECTION
CHANGE SLIDE CHANGE DETECTIONS WHICH UH OF COURSE WHAT I UNDERSTOOD IS ALSO THEY TRY TO RECOVER THE LAYOUT SOMEHOW
I MEAN GIVEN THE SLIDES BUT THEY ARE IN NO CASE THEY ARE EXTRACTING THE TEXT FROM THE SLIDES
SO WITH IN UH IN UH ALL THE CASES WHAT I'VE SEEN
IN ALL THE CASES I'VE SEEN I MEAN THEY S ASSUME THAT AT LEAST YOU HAVE LIKE A P. D. F. VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT OR WHAT
AND BASICALLY THEY TRY TO MATCH WHAT IS DISPLAYED
TO THE DOCUMENT
SO FIRST THEY NEED TO EXTRACT THE INFORMATION FROM THE DOCUMENT WHICH IS NOT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE SO TRIVIAL
AT LEAST FOR UH BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO WORKING WITH UH MAYBE MORE COMPLEX DOCUMENTS WITH IMAGES AND TEXT AND SO ON
MAYBE WITH SLIDES IT'S EA IT'S EASIER TO EXTRACT UH THE INFORMATION
I ASSUME IT'S EA IT'S EASIER INDEED
BUT THEY UH ASSUME BASICALLY UH THAT THEY HAVE THIS DOCUMENT
WHICH IS SOMETHING SOMEHOW WE WOULD LIKE TO RELAX UH BECAUSE UH PEOPLE UH LIKE IN IT'S YOU MAY NOT WANT EACH TIME TO ASK THE PERSON
MAYBE THE PERSON HAS A POINT POINT NOT THE NOT A P. D. F. VERSION
OR MAYBE HE'S USING EXCEL TO DO A DEMONSTRATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND WE'LL WANT TO AVOID THIS
MM
MM
BUT BUT MOST YOU WOULD SAY MOST MOST OF THE POINTS FOR US I MEAN WOULD BE VALID
I MEAN SLIDE TRANSITION WE WOULD USE SLIDE UH NEED TO DO IT SLIDE TRANSITION
TO SOME EXTENT WE WOULD LIKE TO EXTRACT SOME ELEMENTS OF THE LAYOUT TO DISTING TO HAVE A MORE HIGH ANALYSIS
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS MORE AUTOMATICALLY AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE TEXT RECOGNITION TO DO TO BE ABLE TO DO RETRIEVAL UH OF SLIDES OR POINTS
I MEAN OF PARTS OF PRESENTATION
WE WOULD LIKE NOT TO HAVE TO RELY YEAH TO A FIRST P. D. F. VERSION OR ANY VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT
SO YEAH
SO THE C YOU HAVE BOUGHT THIS CARD RIGHT
I MEAN YOU SAY THIS IS A CARD
NO NO
YEAH
BUT I MEAN THIS ONE IS THE I. V. C.
OKAY
SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS ON THIS CARD THERE ARE FOUR INPUTS RIGHT
OKAY
NOT N SO ENOUGH UH WELL YEAH YEAH
I WAS THINKING TO SOME EXTENT NOTHING WOULD WOULD PREVENT US UH FROM ALSO ACQUIRING THE SLIDE BUT REALLY THE SLIDE STREAM FROM FROM THIS CARD INDEED
RIGHT
OR
YEAH
OKAY
TO CAPTURE THE SLIDE
YEAH
OKAY
WELL
I MEAN JUST BECAUSE WE CANNOT REC UH WE CAN W SOMETHING WE CANNOT DO WITH UH IT SEEMS FOR WITH THE HIGH Q QUALITY UH CAPTURE UH DEVICE IS TO HAVE A STREAM
I MEAN THE STREAM
RIGHT THE FULL STREAM
SO WE CAN TAPE SNAPSHOTS
SO BASICALLY IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO HAVE STILL UM UH THE S UH THE SLIDE STREAM SO THAT FOR INSTANCE IF WE DETECT THERE IS A NEW VIDEO THAT IS DISPLAYED ALSO ON
TO SOME EXTENT WE COULD JUST CUT THIS VIDEOS TO KEEP IT AND TO BE ABLE TO REPLAY IT UH LATER ON AND SO ON
AND MAYBE INDEED IF FOR INSTANCE THE SLIDE STREAM ON THE ON THE RIGHT IS AUTOMATICALLY SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE OTHER PARTS OF THE VIDEO
IT MAY BE EASIER TO S TO UH SYNCHRONIZE DIRECTLY BY SOME SOME MATCHING PROCESS
THE SLIDES THE HIGH QUALITY MEASURES WE HAVE HERE WE'VE DIRECTLY YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
SO AT LEAST UH THIS IS NOT AT THE ELECTRONIC LEVEL
BUT YOU WOULD SAY AS A CONTENTS FROM THE CONTENT LEVEL
DOING AN ALIGNMENT FROM THE SLIDE STREAM AND FROM THE SNAP SHOTS WE WOULD HAVE ON THE OTHER SIDE W IS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE
OF COURSE IF WE HAVE SOME YOU KNOW SOME CONSTRAINTS GIVEN BY THE ELECTRONIC I MEAN IT'S THAT'S BETTER
UH BECAUSE OF COURSE FIRST THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE EASIER AND IT MAY BE JUST A FEW SIGNALS THAT WE HAVE TO ALIGN ON THE OTHER PARTS
BUT I THINK I COULD SEE I COULD IMAGINE THAT THIS COULD BE A REASONABLE PROCESS TO DO
AND IT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS WOULD SOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES REGARDING I MEAN LIKE THE POSSIBILITY OF D OF DISPLAYING VIDEOS AFTER FROM FROM WHAT WE RECORD
SO YEAH
WELL THIS IS MORE OR LESS WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED RIGHT IF I UNDERSTAND
SO LIKE THE DIVA PROJECT IS A TAPE FREE ALREADY SMART MEETING ROOM HUH
OKAY
BUT THIS CAN BE DONE AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT
I MEAN IS THE OKAY
SO AT T. N. O. THEY HAVE SOMETHING
AH OKAY
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
NO
NO THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING
YEAH SO CURRENTLY BECAUSE THERE IS A TIME CODE UH VIDEO TIME CODE
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FRAME DROPPING I MEAN BECAUSE ANYWAY IN EACH IN THE VIDEO SIGNAL IT IS ENCODED THE TIME RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM
OKAY
WELL BUT YOU DON'T I MEAN AT THIS POINT YOU DON'T REALLY CARE BECAUSE
I MEAN IN THE SIGNAL YOU CAN EXTRACT THE TIME
I MEAN THE TIME STAMP IS I IN THE SIGNAL
SO IF YOU DROP SOME FRAME
WHICH HAPPENS SOMETIMES WHEN YOU DO COMPRESSION OR ACQUISITION UH YOU YOU UH EV YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY FIND THIS IN UH THE SIGNAL RIGHT
I MEAN IT'S ENCODED IN THE IN THE IMAGE
SO YOU CAN YOU CAN DO IT
OTHERWISE UH IF THERE IS SOME FRAME DROPPING YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THE NUMBER OF FRAMES YOU ARE COUNTING MORE OR LESS I SUPPOSE TO TO ASSESS IT
UH SO YOU HAVE YOU HAVE SOME PROBLEMS THEN YEAH
OKAY
WHICH I WHICH WAS MORE OR LESS T. N. O.
S PROBLEM
WITH RESPECT TO FRAME DROPPING RIGHT
YEAH
WELL I THINK IF IT WAS NOT A PROBLEM OF FRAME DROPPING THE ALIGNMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EASY TO TO DO
AND THE
REALLY
WELL SO IT WAS NOT SUCH A DIFFICULT PROCESS THEN
YEAH BUT IF IT'S ONLY TO FIND UH ONE OF SET YOU HAVE TO FIND SOME EXA SOME EXAMPLES
BUT I I HAD THE FEELING THAT THEY HAD ALSO SOME FRAME DROPPING THAT WAS UH NO
OKAY
OKAY
THEN THAT'S FINE
YEAH BUT MAYBE THERE ARE ALREADY SOME MACHINES YOU KNOW UH UH
UH
YEAH I MEAN JUST THAT YOU KNOW IF OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A C OTHER LIBRARIES THAT MAY
YOU KNOW CONFLICT WITH THE ONE YOU ARE TRYING TO USE
AT THE SAME TIME YO SEE IF YOU CRASH A MACHINE I MEAN BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING SOME TEST
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO HAVE WHAT'S ON YOUR MACHINE I MEAN TO UH TO BE TO BE UH DE ERASED OR WHATS WHATEVER
SO I THINK IT'S SO MAYBE THERE IS A MACHINE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER FOR THIS YOU NEED YOU KNOW A VERY POWERFUL MACHINE AND SO ON
BUT MAYBE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO USE A CURRENT MACHINE WHICH IS ONLY U YEAH THAT'S IS WITHDRAWN FROM THE NETWORK OR YEAH
THE CARD
YEAH
BUT STILL I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S DONE ON THE CARD YOU NEED TO BASIC THING YOU NEED TO CHECK IS UM IS A BUS RIGHT
I MEAN THE BUS WRITING I MEAN THE SPEED OF UH THE BUS
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO C. P. U. ITSELF MAY NOT BE SO
THE ACCESS YEAH
SO CAN WE EXPECT A CHRISTMAS UH GIFT
UH
MM
FOR INSTANCE I MEAN THE TEST OF LOOKING AT THEIR ENTRY GOES POINT BY POINT
SO LOOKING AT THEIR CODE I MEAN UH SO YOU SAID YOU WOULD LOOK AT THIS RIGHT
OR IS IT OKAY
'KAY
WELL UH
BECAUSE I MEAN I MEAN THE I. V. C. SYSTEM
I MEAN IT'S UH I SO MY FEELING IS THAT I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE EXPERTISE IN THIS LIKE IN FRIBOURG ALSO
SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD TAKE A LOT OF TIME I MEAN JUST TO LOOK AT THIS RIGHT
I MEAN AT LEAST ONE MONTH SEEMS TO BE UH QUITE ENOUGH FOR THIS RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE ANYWAY THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE WORKING ON RIGHT
IS THE I. V. C. BUT USING THE SIGNALS THAT ARE COMING I MEAN SO BASICALLY IT'S USING THE I. V. C. OKAY
OKAY SO CURRENTLY YOU ARE NOT WORKING ON THIS
OKAY THEN WE NEED
YEAH THAT THAT'S THAT'S SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUE I MEAN THAT UH MAYBE DON'T KNOW W WHETHER YOU REALISE
BUT OF COURSE IF WE HAVE THIS IN TWO YEARS MAYBE OKAY IT'S GOOD WE HAVE IT
BUT OF COURSE IT'S IT'S ON THE IT'S TOO LONG I MEAN IN TERMS OF IN TERM OF RESEARCH
IN TERMS UH MAYBE EVEN IN TERMS OF INNOVATION I MEAN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHAT UH THEY SAID
I MEAN HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT INNOVATION
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE AN INNOVATION
AND THE THE I KNOW I'M WE WE SEE QUITE WELL WHY IS WORKING ON THIS RIGHT
BUT IN TWO YEARS YOU KNOW IF WE WANT TO DO IF WE WANT TO BUILD A C. T. I. OR TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS
YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU C OF COURSE OKAY PEOPLE WILL SAY YEAH
BUT THERE IS ALREADY SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO PUT ON THE MARKET AND SO ON
SO IT MAYBE NOT THE IT'S IT'S TOO LATE UH TO TO DO IT
SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY SO THIS IS ONE OF THE POINTS RESPECT TO RESEARCH OF COURSE
IT'S I THINK IT'S GOING TO APPEAR MORE MORE AND MORE AND UH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
BECAUSE WHEN WHEN YOU SAY HERE NOW NO I'M NOT GOING TO START TO WORKING ON THIS BEFORE JANUARY
FOR ME THIS SURPRISES ME TO SOME EXTENT YOU KNOW I'M UH I THOUGHT I MEAN YOU WOULD YOU WOULD BE WORKING ON THIS
SO IF YOU SAY OKAY NOW IT'S UH YEAH
NO UH OUI
NO
I MEAN THE POINT IS THAT OLIVIER WILL R YOU HAVE I MEAN S SINCE ONE YEAR UH YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AND SO ON
SO IT SEEMS THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN A PRIORITY
SO THAT THAT'S UH THAT'S THE POINT
SO IF YOU HAVE NO TIME TO PUT PRIORITY AT SOME POINTS AND THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE DURING ONE YEAR ON THIS PROJECT
I MEAN YOU NEED TO SAY IT NOW
I MEAN THAT'S THE POINT NOW
SO THIS IS FRANCK
AT LEAST UH SAY THIS TO US AND WE'LL SEE UH WITH FRANCK
AND AGAIN I MEAN THIS IS A QUESTION
SO NOW YOU ARE SAYING YOU HAVE NO TIME
SO NOW YOU SAY TO US
SO NOW WE UNDERSTAND AND WE ARE MAYBE AFTER
WHEN WE IF WE DISCUSS WITH FRANCK UH FRANCK CRITTIN OR UH UH FRANK UH FORMAZ AND WE'LL SEE OKAY AND GO AND TRY TO SEE
OKAY APPARENTLY UH HE HAS NO TIME TO TO WORK ON THIS
SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE'D LIKE TO TO DO SOMETHING
SO WHAT KIND OF SOLUTION AS ALEXANDRE MENTIONS I DO WE NEED TO TAKE SOMEBODY
DO WE WANT TO DO WE NEED TO TAKE SOME INTERN TO WORK ON THIS UH AND SO ON AND SO ON
DO WE TAKE TO HAVE UH SOMEBODY UH FOR CONTRACT EVEN IF IT'S NOT AN INTERN BUT TAKE SOMEBODY FOR SIX MONTHS TO WORK ON THIS
I MEAN BUT SO THIS A POINT
I MEAN UH Y I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER PROJECTS YOU HAVE TO DO
I DON'T KNOW WITH WHO YOU ARE DISCUSSING ABOUT THE TIME YOU ARE YOU CAN S UH S SPEND ON EACH OF THE PROJECT
BUT IF Y BECAUSE NOW YOU ARE JUST TELLING US YOU HAVE NO TIME INDEED TO WORK ON THIS RIGHT
OKAY SO SO OKAY
YEAH BUT I MEAN C IT'S YEAH BUT
WELL I MEAN UH I MEAN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE AWARE OF UH M. F. C.
I MEAN I MEAN PEOPLE UH I SUPPOSE AT H. U. V. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE UH WHERE I WAS IN LE MANS IN THE U. B. UH I MEAN THERE UH WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY SOME SOME STUDENTS UH THAT WOULD BE AWARE OF AND THAT COULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS
I MEAN THEY ARE WORKING WITH SOFTWARE AND HARD BOTH OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE
UH I'M I'M SURE THE S SE
BECAUSE UH SO SO OLIVIER SAYS IT'S NOT BEFORE JANUARY ON HIS SIDE
SO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT UH ON YOUR SIDE WHE WHAT'S YOUR YEAH
LIKE WHAT
ONE DAY A WEEK UH SOMETHING LIKE THIS
BUT
BECAUSE UH BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES I WOULD SAY
LIKE IF THERE WOULD BE A MACHINE LIKE THIS WITH THE TWO CARDS SEPARATED AS I MENTION
I MEAN IF WE RECORD LE THE FLOW OF THE VIDEO FOR INSTANCE AND THE SNAP SHOTS FROM THE SLIDES TO SOME EXTENT THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY OF DOING SOME AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT WITHOUT HAVING A SPECIAL
YOU KNOW
SYNCHRON SO THIS MEANS THAT TO SOME EXTENT WE COULD HAVE A DEVICE WHICH WOULD NOT YET BE FULLY SYNCHRONIZED AND
I DON'T KNOW WE'VE UH YOU KNOW VERY WELL DONE UH CODE IN TERMS OF SENDING SIGNALS AND SO ON
BUT THAT MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT BECAUSE I MEAN IT SYNCHRONIZE UP TO DON'T KNOW FIVE SECONDS
AND YOU WOULD SAY FIVE SECONDS MAY SEEM A LOT FOR AUDIO AND VIDEO
BUT MAYBE F RESPECT TO SLIDES AND THE REST IS NOT IS SOMETHING THAT MAY BE TOLERABLE
SO STILL WE WOULD BE ABLE TO START DOING SOME RECORDINGS AND MAYBE UH DOING EVEN THE AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT OR AT LEAST WE WOULD HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT
YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF ALIGNMENTS
UH DO DO BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE WITH MICROPHONE ARRAYS WHERE YOU WOULD NEED MICRO SECOND ALIGNMENTS OF COURSE
UH OR EVEN MAYBE WITH WE WANT VIDEO WHERE IT MAY BE ONE OR TWO FRAMES I DON'T KNOW
SO THIS IS REALLY SOME SOMEHOW I MEAN THE UH THE THE ISSUE I MEAN I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF POSSIBILITIES TO DO THINGS
AND THE GOAL WOULD BE THAT INDEED WE COULD START UH REC DOING SOME OF THE RECORDINGS OF THE TIME SO THAT INDEED WE WOULD ALREADY WE UH WE WOULD HAVE UH SOMETHING WHERE UH WE COULD UH START GETTING THE DATA
BECAUSE AFTER I MEAN EVEN IF IT THERE WE CANNOT PUT ALL THE TIMES IN ONE WEEK RIGHT
I MEAN SO AND UH SO I MEAN THIS IS UH THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUE AS WELL
WHICH IS TO HAVE IT SO THAT WE CAN PLAY AND WE CAN MAKE A NICE DEMO AND SO ON WITH THE FULL UH THING AND SOMETHING
SO F THE OTHER PART IS TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHICH FROM WHICH WE CAN ALREADY RECORD DATA AND WITH SOME APPROXIMATION
AND I HAVE THE FEELING GIVEN THE DESCRIPTIONS THAT YOU MADE
THAT TO HAVE SUCH A SYSTEM WOULDN'T REQUIRE A SIX MONTHS OF WORK BECAUSE BASICALLY THEIR OWN CODE IS THERE TO SOME EXTENT AND UH THE I. V. C. IS SOMETHING QUITE STANDARD FROM WHICH WE COULD ASK I MEAN EVEN WE COULD EVEN PAY MAYBE PRO SOME PEOPLE FROM FRIBOURG
I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN TO COME HERE AND TO AND TO HELP US WITH THE INSTALLATION ON A COMPUTER AND UH AND UH TO TO TO GET THE SO I HAVE MORE THE FEELING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE ALMOST IN ONE MONTH
AGAIN I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE SYNCHRONIZATION I MEAN AS
YEAH I MEAN THE TWO YEAH YEAH
YEAH THE FOR INSTANCE A SIMPLE QUESTION MAYBE YOU CAN ARE WE SURE THAT IT CAN WORK ON A SINGLE COMPUTER
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN IS THERE ANY UH ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THIS
SO THIS IS YEAH
SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE IT IT'S MORE TESTING IT DOES NOT REQUIRE SO FOR THIS WE I MEAN IF YOU PUT THE TWO CARDS ON THE COMPUTER
YOU PUT THE TWO THEN YOU YOU BASICALLY YOU SAY PLAY ON THE BOTH SIDES AND YOU LOOK WHETHER AT THE END YOU HAVE UH A RECORDED SIGNALS WHICH IS IS IS UH THE TIME THAT IT SHOULD UH BE AND UH OR WHETHER I MEAN THE FACT THAT WHENEVER I MEAN THE SLIDES IS DOING SOME UH PROCESSING UH IT THERE IS SOME AND THERE IS SOME FRAME DROPS OR THINGS LIKE THIS
SO THIS IS UH
AH
MM-HMM
I'M I'M WONDERING WHETHER STILL WE COULD ASK FOR TO GET AN INTERN FOR THIS
I MEAN UH
YEAH THIS IS UH STILL UH EVEN EVEN THE NON DIPLOMA WORK
I MEAN THE THINGS WE COULD ASK UH BUT I WOULD YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
WELL YOU
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE
YEAH
WELL BUT YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
I THINK IT'S
UH
SORRY
I DON'T HAVE MY PRESENTATION
UM
YEAH
SO THEY'RE ON MY THEY'RE ON A
NO NO
THEY ARE
YEAH
NO NO
MY D. MACHINE
YEAH
OKAY
JUST GOING
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
SO UH UH YEAH
I WILL DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY
SO UH I WOULD LIKE JUST TO REVIEW AT THE DIFFERENT PROJECT REGARDING ACQUISITION SYSTEM
SO BASICALLY THERE ARE FIVE SYSTEMS
THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED SMAC WHICH IS DEVELOPED BY FRIBOURG AND CERN
THE SECOND ONE I IS YOUR SYSTEM
UH I WOULD TO SAY THE CHEAP MEETING ROOM SYSTEM
THE THIRD ONE YEAH MAYBE I CAN SHARE THAT WITH YOU
THE SMAC YEAH
SHOULD I WRITE
OKAY
THE FIRST ONE IS YEAH I WILL CALL THAT A.
SMAC WHICH IS DEVELOP BY FRIBOURG AND CERN
THE SECOND ONE B.
WHICH IS UH I WOULD LIKE TO CHE SAY UH CHEAP UH MEETING ROOM OR I DON'T KNOW
OKAY
P. A. S.
OKAY P. A. S.
THE THIRD ONE IS UM
OKAY
THE THIRD ONE IS CALLED UH THE S UM THIS IS UH THE SMART MEETING ROOM DEVELOP AT FRIBOURG WHICH IS CALLED THE SMART
IT'S DIVA
OKAY
THE P DIVA
D. I. V. A. SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THE THIRD ONE IS CALL UH THE THIRD ONE IS UH THE PROJECT THAT I HAVE TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT SMART MEETING ROOM AT IDIAP
UH FOR THAT WE WILL USE UM UH
YEAH A TAPE THREE UH OKAY LET'S CALL THAT
AND THE LAST ONE I WOULD LIKE JUST MENTION JUST TO FOR THE MEETING AND THIS IS UH THE FIRE WIRE
UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW MY PRESENTATION DURING MY TURN
YOU DID YOU
UH OKAY
E. WHICH IS FIREWIRE
OKAY
SO I WILL START JUST WITH THE SMAC
SO MAYBE I DRAW LINE HERE
SO THE SMAC
THE SMAC PROJECT THE SMAC PROJECT IS A PROJECT WHICH AIMS TO DO THE ACQUISITION OF AUDIO VIDEO AND SLIDE UH FOR PRESENTATION
YEAH THIS PROJECT IS DONE WITH FRIBOURG AND CERN
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE A VERY SHORT UM GRAPHIC
IN FACT THEY USE UM
A CARD A VIDEO CARD WHICH IS CALL UM I. V. C. MM YEAH
I JUST WRITE I. V. C.
IN FACT THIS IS A VIDEO CARD WITH FOUR UM INPUTS
ON THESE FOUR INPUTS YOU CAN HAVE ONLY VIDEO
BUT UH THEY WANT TO MAKE ALSO THE SLIDE ACQUISITION
SO ON ONE INPUT THEY PUT UM A CONVERSION BOX A CONVERTER WHICH CONVERTS FROM SLIDE
TO VIDEO
SO THAT MEAN THAT WE DECREASE UH THE THE QUALITY
WE HAVE A HIGH QUALITY IN SLIDE AND WE GO TO LOW QUALITY TO LOWER QUALITY WITH UH VIDEO
UM SO THIS ONE IS JUST FOR THE SMAC
NOW I WILL JUST MOVE
D
YEAH
THESE ONE ARE JUST FOR VIDEO AND AUDIO
YOU CAN USE UH THEM
AND THIS BOARD DOES UH THE DIVX COMPRESSION ON THE FLY
THIS IS UH THE BOX THAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE
THE THE CARD THAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE
UH I THINK
MM
OKAY
SO THE SOLUTION TO THAT LOW QUALITY IS UH SOLVED B BY YOU PROJECT THE PAS PROJECT
UH UH I MAKE A TICK HERE AND I CLEAN UP THIS IS JUST TO TO SOLVE THAT PRO THAT PROBLEM REGARDING THE SLIDE AND THE SLIDE RESOLUTION
SO WE REMOVE UH THAT PART
AND WE CALL THAT THE PAS
AND IN THAT CASE WE USE UM A FRAME GRABBER HERE
AND WE GO WITH THE SLIDE HERE
AND UM OF COURSE THESE TWO CARDS WILL BE ON THE SAME MACHINE
AND UH WE HAVE TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION HERE
THE MAIN CRITICAL POINT IS HERE
THE SYNCHRONISATION BETWEEN THESE TWO UH THESE TWO CARDS
AND WITH THAT THIS IS THE CARD THAT WE USE IN THE SMART MEETING ROOM AND THIS IS UH THE CARD THE UM
YEAH THESE ONE NO NO
TH UH THIS ONE IS AND THIS ONE THE VIDEO CARD
AND THIS ONE THIS IS UH THE CARD THAT WE HAVE ALREADY AT IDIAP FOR THE SLI
YEAH YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
SO
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SO WE CAN HAVE BOTH
WE CAN HAVE THE SLIDE FROM THE SLIDE CAPTURE AND WE CAN JUST USE UH A VIDEO SIGNAL TO TO CAPTURE THAT ALSO
TO HAVE TWO T UH MM YOU WANTS TO HA DO YOU HAVE TWO QUALITY H HIGH QUALITY AND
YEAH WE CAN JUST TAKE SOME SNAPSHOTS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WITH UM THIS ONE
SO YEAH YOU WON'T YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SOMETHING LIKE LIKE SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEP
YEAH YEAH
CH YEAH
VIDEO
YEAH
OKAY
SO UH I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PAS PROJECT
MAYBE I WOULD LIKE JUST NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE DIVA PROJECT
SO I CLEAN UP
YEAH
I
THERE
UM DID YOU READ SOMETHING REGARDING THE DIVA PROJECT
IN FA YEAH UH WE JUST REMEMBER THAT HERE WE WE STILL HAVE ONLY ONE MACHINE TO DO UH THE SLIDE VIDEO AND AUDIO ACQUISITION
AND THE DIVA IT WAS UH SOMETHING DIFFERENT
FACT WE HAVE A MASTER MACHINE THAT'S UM
WE HAVE A MASTER MACHINE HERE
AND WE HAVE SOME SLAVES MACHINE HERE
WE HAVE SOME CONNECTION AND HERE WE HAVE SOME INPUT
WE HAVE AUDIO
USUALLY WE HAVE AUDIO
AND
AND THE SAME FOR THIS ONE
AND UM BASICALLY ON THE SLAVE MACHINE WE HAVE TWO CARDS ONE FOR AUDIO AND ONE FOR VIDEO
SO THEY DEVELOP SOMETHING TO SYNCHRONIZE THESE TWO CARDS TOGETHER AND TH UH THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH IS IT'S MORE W WHICH IS CALL UH DIRECT SHOW
UH WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO TO SYNCHRONIZE UH THESE TWO CARDS TOGETHER
AND BUT OF COURSE YOU WANT THESE TWO STREAMS TO BE SYNCHRONIZE
BUT YOU WANT ALSO THESE TWO STREAMS TO BE SYNCHRONIZED
SO THEY HAVE A SYNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN TWO SLAVES WHICH IS DONE BY THE MASTER
HERE WE JUST USE UH THE ET ETHERNET NETWORK TO SYNCHRONIZE UH THESE TWO UM THESE TWO DEVICE
UM I JUST WRITE
INTERNET SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND UH THEY DO ONLY AUDIO AND VIDEO
UH THEY DON'T DO ANY SLIDE
UM
SLIDE ACQUISITION YEAH
OKAY
SO YVES ASKED FOR THE DIVA
I WOULD LIKE JUST TO TALK NOW REGARDING UH THE THE FIRE FREE SMART MEETING ROOM AT IDIAP
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION
OR UH
WHAT YEAH TAPE FREE SORRY
TAPE FREE SMART MEETING ROOM
SO FOR THAT I
YEAH
IT'S YEAH
IT'S A TAPE FREE BUT ALSO VIDEO
UH AND THE ACQUISITION IS DONE IN RAW VIDEO
SO THE FILE IS HUGE AND THEY REALLY NEED UH UM THEY HAVE A LONG POST PROCESSING TO CONVERT RAW FILE TO UH DIVX OR TO OUR OWN FILES
YEAH BUT IT TAKES TIME
IT IT'S JUST JUST TO MENTION THAT
UH SO
I WILL WRITE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
SO MAYBE FIRST I WILL JUST DESCRIBE THE MA THE SMART MEETING ROOM THAT WE HAVE AT IDIAP
IN FACT WE HAVE UH ALSO A MASTER SLAVE ARCHITECTURE
UM I CLEAN A LITTLE BIT
WE HAVE THE MASTER P. C. WHICH TAKE KS UH WHICH TAKES CARE ABOUT THE AUDIO
I CLEAN THAT
AND WE HAVE THE SLAVE P. C. WHICH TAKE CARES ABOUT THE WHITE BOARD AND THE SLIDES
NOW IF WE LOOK AT THE VIDEO
IF WE LOOK AT THE VIDEO IN FACT UM YEAH MAYBE FIRST I SHOULD MENTION THAT
BETWEEN THE MASTER AND THE SLAVE WE HAVE UM THE MM A SYNCHRONIZATION SIGNAL WHICH IS CALL TIME MIDI TIME CODE
I JUST WRITE MIDI
AND FOR THE VIDEO WE HAVE THE VIDEO INPUT HERE
WE RE USE THE UM MIDI SIGNAL
UH WITH UM TO INSERT THE TIME CODE ON EACH FRAME
AND WE SAVE THAT TO D. V. RECORDER
UH I I HAVE VIDEO
OKAY
UH WE KNOW THE PROBLEM OF THAT THAT UH THIS IS THAT AFTER EACH MEETING SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE CARE ABOUT THE D. V. TAPES AND TO T CONVERT THEM INTO DIVX
SO MY IDEA IS TO D DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS TO DEVELOP A S UM
UM UH A VIDEO SLAVE MACHINE
MAY I SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH A VIDEO SLAVE MACHINE UH WHICH USE THE MIDI UM WHICH USE ALSO THE MIDI TIME CODE
NO SORRY
SORRY I'M DOING SOMETHING WRONG
WE HAVE THE VIDEO HERE
WE JUST HAVE THE TIME CODE INSERTER
SO WE TAKE THAT SIGNAL HERE AND WE MOVE TO THIS UH MACHINE HERE WHICH IS IN FACT JUST UH THE I. V. C. VIDEO CARD
THIS JUST AN ACQUISITION CARD
AND WE COM AND WE S AND WE CONVERT FILE DIRECTLY TO DIVX
AND UM SO WE WILL HAVE HERE VIDEO
AND ALSO BECAUSE WE WANT TO CONTROL THAT MACHINE WE USE ALSO THE MIDI TIME CODE THE MIDI TIME CODE TO START AND TO STOP THE MACHINE
THIS IS JUST SOMETHING UH THAT UH THIS JUST TO REMOVE THE D. V. RECORDINGS
BUT UM YEAH
JUST UH THIS JUST AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE SMART MEETING ROOM
OKAY
UH DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION UH REGARDING UH THAT
YEAH
WE DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THE SYNCHRONIZATION IN THAT CASE BECAUSE THE TIME CODE IS INS SERTED HERE
AND WE TAKE AFTER THE TIME CODE INSERTION WE TAKE THE VIDEO SIGNAL AND WE PASS THROUGH THE MACHINE
SO UH THIS IS UH A SIMPLE SOLUTION BUT UM WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THE SYNCHRONIZATION
CO YEAH
THE SYNCHRONIZATION IS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO THE F LAST ONE IS UH THE FIRE WIRE ACQUISITION
UH I JUST
OKAY
OKAY
UM IN FACT THE THE MAJOR PROBLEM REGARDING ACQUISITION SYSTEM IS ALWAYS THE SYNCHRONIZATION
AND FOR THAT FIRE WIRE IS GOOD
I MEAN FIRE WIRE WAS A PROJECT
NOW THE PROJECT IS UH STAND BY
UH WE DON'T MOVE TO THAT PROJECT
I AM BUT I AM JUST GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS ONE
UM SO WITH ACQUISITION WITH ACQUISITION SYSTEMS UH THE MAJOR PROBLEM THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS UH THE SYNCHRONIZATION
AND FIRE WIRE GIVES YOU SOME UM SOME WAY TO BE SYNCHRONIZE IN FACT
UH THIS IS UH I JUST WANT TO TO DESCRIBE HERE THE BUS
THIS UH YEAH THIS IS OF THE BUS WHERE YOU CAN SEND YOU CAN SEND SOME PACKAGE
AND ANY DEVICE WE WHICH WANTS TO SEND A PACKAGE A P A PACKET SORRY SHOULD ASK UM THERE IS A MANAGER OF THAT BUS
THIS JUST OF THE BUS
ANY DEVICE WHICH WANTS TO SEND A PACKET HAS TO R TO R
UH REQUIRE SOME UH BAND WIDTH ON THE BUS ON THE BUS
AND SO AFTER THAT HE WILL HAVE THAT BAND WIDTH
AND HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT BAND WIDTH
SO UM YEAH HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT BAND WIDTH
AND SO WE ARE SURE THAT WE WILL HAVE A SYNCHRONIZE ACQUISITION WITH FIRE WIRE
AND SO SO THAT MEAN THAT UM
YEAH
YEAH
SORRY SORRY
UH YEAH
HARDWARE
IT'S I IT'S DONE BY IT'S DONE BY HARDWARE
IT'S DONE BY HARDWARE
NO NO NO NO NO
AND IN FACT YEAH
I I AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE HAVE A BUS MANAGER AND THE BUS MANAGER SEND JUST A FLAG TO SAY NOW IT'S TIME TO GIVE ME YOU DATA
AND ALL DEVICES WHICH HAVE UH REQUIRED SOME BAND WIDTH WILL SEND THE DATA
SO I'M JUST DRAWING SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THIS IS THIS KIND OF SIGNAL THAT THE TH BUS MANAGER IS SENDING
AND JUST AFTER THAT BUS JUST AFTER THAT UH SIGNAL ALL DEVICE WILL SEND UH THE DATA
SO WE WILL HAVE THE DATA FROM A. FROM B. AND FROM C. AND SO ON
AND AFTER THE NEXT ONE WE WILL HAVE AGAIN THE UM
THE DATA FROM A. B. AND C. AND SO ON AND SO ON
AND SO WITH FIRE WIRE WE ARE SURE TO HAVE A UM AN ACQUISITION SYSTEM
NOW THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH FIRE WIRE IS THAT THAT FIRE WIRE IS JUST AN KIND OF INTELLIGENT UH A SMART PIPE
A SYNCHRONIZED PIPE
WE CAN PUT WHAT WE WANT INSIDE
SO WE CAN PUT RAW DATA OR WE CAN SEND A DIVX DATA
OR WE CAN SEND ALSO UH WHAT I UH WAS PRESENTING IN MY TERM PRESENTATION WAS A H. TWO SIX FOUR
BUT IN THAT CASE WE NEED SOMETHING UH HARDWARE HERE TO UNCODE RAW DATA TO A GIVEN FORMAT
OF COURSE UH THE IDEA IS TO REDUCE UM THE BAND WIDTH ON THE BUS ALSO
AND ALL DATA ARE SENT THROUGH THE MASTER
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUEST
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH IN FACT THE UM SLIDE CARD L SORRY
THE SLIDE CARD AND THE VIDEO CARD ARE BOTH S. D. K.
SO WHAT
YEAH
BOTH ARE S. D. K.
YEAH
YEAH Y YEAH
YEAH THIS FOR THAT YOU UH I DON'T REMEMBER BY HOW
NO
BUT
USUALLY AUDIO AUDIO AND VIDEO SHOULD BE SYNCHRONIZED
BECAUSE UH THIS JUST AN ON AN AUDIO VIDEO CHANNEL
SO UH THEY ARE SYNCHRONIZE
UM SO WE CAN PLAY WITH THE VIDEO
WE CAN PLAY WITH THE SLIDE
UH AND AFTER THAT AND THE MAJOR POINT IS TO M COMBINE BOTH
YEP
WE WE DON'T HAVE SYNCHRONIZATION
WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION AND FOR THAT MIGHT BE WE CAN USE UH DIRECT SHOW
WHICH IS A SYN WHICH IS A TECHNIQUE TO SYNCHRONIZE DIFFERENT DEVICE
NO NO
THIS IS JUST UH AN APPLICATION WHICH I
NO NO NO NO NO
NO
THIS NOT ON THE CARD
THIS JUST AN APPLICATION THAT RUNS ON THE MACHINE
UM F I THINK DIRECT SHOW YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FOR FREE
I'M I'M NOT SURE
M I SHOULD CHECK
OR
YEAH IT M YEAH
I THINK THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO HAVE A MACHINE JUST WHICH IS ONLY DEDICATED TO TO THAT
BECAUSE UH IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU USE A MACHINE WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE PLENTY OF LIBRARIES
AND SO YOU YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE JUST A DEDICATED MACHINE JUST FOR THAT
JUST FOR
OKAY
OKAY
MM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I I OUI
BECAUSE
BECAUSE I THINK UM THE VIDEO IS DONE THE VIDEO COMPRESSION IS DONE ON THE ON THAT CARD AND UH I'M NOT HUNDRED PERCENT SURE
BUT I THINK THE J. PEG THE J. PEG CONVERSION FOR THE SLIDE CAPTURE IS DONE ALSO ON THE CARD
SO WE DON'T NEED
AH YEAH
YEAH
BUT I MEAN YEAH
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THE THE SPEED OF THE COMPUTER COULD BE LOWER
MAYBE A FIRST SO SOLUTION WILL BE JUST TO START W WITH
BECAUSE WE NEED TO START WITH SOMETHING
WE HAVE THE SLIDE CAPTURE FROM DARREN
WE HAVE UM I WILL WORK ON THE VIDEO ACQUISITION FOR THE INPU THE TAPE FREE SMART MEETING ROOM
SO I WILL START WITH THAT TO DEVELOP SOME KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THAT BOARD UH THAT VIDEO BOARD AND AFTER THAT WE CAN COMBINE BOTH
NO
FOR NOT FOR NO NO
THIS NOT FOR END OF NEXT YEAR
IT'S TOO LONG
AND IT IT'S UH IT'S TOO LONG IT'S TOO LONG
FOR MYSELF I WOULD LIKE TO SAY UH APRIL MAY
APRIL MAY WE SHOULD HAVE RESULTS
UH NO NO NO
UH I MEAN THE UM
UH NOT AL ALMOST UH THE UH THE THE UH THE COMPLETE APPLICATION
MAYBE SOME MINOR WILL APPEARS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
UH THEY HAVE
YEAH TH IT'S A YEAH
BUT WE START WITH THE I. V. C.
WE START WITH THE DATA PATH
UH THE THE SLIDE FRAME GRABBER
AND AFTER THAT IS AND THE QUESTION IS HOW TO SYNCHRONI TO TO TO MAKE BOTH CARD WORKING TOGETHER
YEAH
UH I. V. C. I. V. C. SHOULD GO FASTER
YEAH
I WILL UH I'M NOT CURRENTLY WORKING ON IT
I WILL START TO WORK ON JANUARY ON THAT POINT
SO UH BUT I THINK
NO NO
I'M NOT WORKING
I SCHEDULE TO TO WORK ON THAT FROM M
YEAH
BUT I HAVE ALSO A QUE
MAYB
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY UH THERE IS MANY UNKNOWN IN THAT PROJECT
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WE CAN MAKE UH UH A SCHEDULE OF THAT PROJECT TO JUST TO TRACK TO JUST TO SEE IF WE TRACK THE TIME TABLE
IF WE DON'T WE WE ASKS FOR MORE PEOPLE MAYBE H. E. V. S. PEOPLE
TO TO TO BE SLIGHTLY INVOLVED IN THAT PROJECT TO BE TO TO RESPECT THE DATE
YEAH
N
YEAH
IT'S TOO LONG
NO
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT UH AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE SOME OTHER PROJECT I I WANT TO FINISH UH THOSE PROJECT FIRST
BUT FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE UH I RECEIVE SOME NEW PROJECT
I SAID THAT I HAVE NO TIME YET
I SAY I HAVE NO TIME GI NOW CURRENTLY I UM I SAY SOME FOR SOME PROJECT YOU SAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
BUT PEOPLE WILL STAY WILL CONTINUE TO SAY NO NO YOU WILL FIND TIME JUST TO DO THAT PROJECT
THE
YEAH
CURRENTLY BUT UH UP TO DECEMBER I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORK ON IT
BUT I PLAN ALREADY
I I UM WITH I. M. TWO I I I DID UH I MENTION THAT I WILL HAVE FROM JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX I WILL HAVE TIME FOR THAT
UH I HAVE A
NO I WILL WORK FULLY ON THAT ON THIS POINT
FROM JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX I WI
MAYBE A GOOD THING WILL BE TO MAKE A PLAN TO TO WE SAY WE WE WON'T SET THE DEADLINE HERE
WE ARE HERE
WE SPLIT THAT PART IN DIFFERENT SEGMENTS
UH Y
YEAH
YEAH THE YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO
NO NO NO
YEAH
YEAH
WHICH IS REALLY BAD
YEAH
I I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
NO I UNDERSTAND
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
WHAT
YEAH
BUT I THINK YEAH THAT WILL BE GOOD JUST TO HAVE A PLAN AND TO HAVE SOME DEADLINE IN THAT PLAN
AND AS SOON AS WE WE WE AS SOON AS WE WE WE ARE NOT IN TIME WE WE WE CON
YEAH
YEAH AND TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM LIKE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND WE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH IF I IF I SAY UNTIL JANUARY THIS IS JUST TO FINISH
UH I WANT TO HAVE THE DEADLINE AT END OF DECEMBER TO FINISH ALL MY PROJECT
I WANT TO FINISH ALL THESE PROJECT WHEN EVERYTHING IS FINISHED
AFTER THAT I CAN MOVE TO ANOTHER ONE
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
YEAH
NO
NO
UH I I DON'T KNOW REGARDING H. E. V. S.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS UH STILL IN TIME
BUT YOU CAN HAVE YOU CAN ASK FOR A STUDENT A D A DIPLOMA WORK
WITH THE LAPEL
SO WE I THINK WE ORGANISE UH JUST TO TO DISCUSS UH
TO DISCUSS UH YEAH THE PROJECT ALEXANDRE AND UH JEAN MARC UH PROPOSED
A ABOUT UH CAPTURING UH AUDIO VIDEO AND SLIDE UH IN A SYNCHRONIZED WAY
AND SO WE WILL START WITH UH AN INTRODUCTION
UH I THINK OLIVIER PREPARED SOME SLIDES ABOUT UH REVIEWING UH
CURRENT SYSTEMS
AND UM
AND THEN EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE MANY THINGS TO TO TALK ABOUT
JUST TO TO START DISCUSSING ABOUT CLEARLY THE PROJECT AND ALSO UM DEALING WITH OUR KIND OF TIMING CONSTRAINTS
AND UH
THE U. U. S. U. UH U. S. B. CORD DOESN'T WORK
AND YOU DIDN'T PUT ON THE
MAYBE YOU CAN ACCESS THROUGH THE NETWORK
IF IT'S ON YOUR H.
OR IT'S ON UH YOUR D. MACHINE
SO MAYBE WE WI WE WILL BE ABLE TO
SHOULD WORK
WHAT
SO UM W YEAH WE HAD LIKE FIVE SLIDES Y UH PRESENTING DIFFERENT SYSTEMS
AND MAYB MAYBE YOU WE CAN DO THAT AT THE WHITE BOARD
I IT'S A BIT STUPID
BUT UH Y YOU KNOW
I THINK YOU REMEMBER WELL THE DIFFERENT UH PARTS
AND UH I'M SURE UH WE CAN DO THAT AT THE WHITE BOARD
YEAH IT WOULD BE GREAT TO USE THE WHITE BOARD
SO THE THE THE FIRST ONE IS UH SMAC
OKAY
YEAH MAYBE YEAH
JUST A REVIEW OF CURRENT SYSTEMS UH TO INTRODUCE
WELL CHEAP MEETING ROOM IS THE YOU KNOW MM IT'S A CONFERENCE ROOM
OR
YEAH
PAS
ALEXANDRE
PAS
YEAH
P PAS PROJECT
SMART MEDIAT UH SMART MINUTES BUT UH I THI DIVA
BECAUSE A SMA YEAH SMART MINUTE IS ALL THE PROCESS OF CAPTURING THE MINUTES AUTOMATICALLY
BUT IT'S DIVA WE CAN SAY
FREE
MM
DOESN'T MATTER
YEAH
AND THIS THE THREE OF THOSE ARE THE V THE THE VIDEO
AND UH I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT THIS C I THINK IT'S QUITE AMBITIOUS PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S WITH UH THE CERN
AND THEY W THEY UH ALREADY WORKED ON UH A EUROPEAN PROJECT CALLED INDICO WHERE THEY THEY HAVE UH RELEASE
DELIVER A FULL UM KIND OF CONFERENCE UH UH SOFTWARE
AND UH TO TO MANAGE UH ALL THE THE CONFERENCE ASPECTS UH UH WE HAVE IN A CONFERENCE AUTOMATICALLY
AND UH I KNOW THAT AT FRIBOURG THEY INSTALLED UH ALREADY IN IN A IN A BIG UH AMPHITHEATRE FOR STUDENTS
AND I GUESS IT'S CURRENTLY WORKING
AH NO
EITHER JUST TO UH IN PARENTHESES UH WE DIDN'T CHOOSE THAT UM THAT SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY HAD NO UM THE THE SLIDES WERE NOT CAPTURED VERY UH IN A VERY UH PRECISE WAY
THAT'S THE POINT
OKAY
OTHERWISE THEY UH IT'S FULLY AUTOMATIC
OR HAVE HAVE YOU DISCUSSED WITH THEM
DID YOU DISCUSS THAT
IS IT FULLY AUTOMATIC
YOU DON'T KNOW
OKAY
BUT THE P I
BUT I I IT ALL SYNCHRONIZE AND I IS IT DOING ALL WHAT WE WANT BUT WITHOUT THE SLIDE UH PRECISION
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
AND UH OKAY
AND WE ARE SU AND WE ARE SURE THAT IN THAT UH CONTEXT OF SMAC PROJECT WITH UH UM FRIBOURG WORKING ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS UH THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH PRECISION UN ENOUGH RESOLUTION IN THE SLIDES
MM YEAH
OKAY
TALK CONFERENCE
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
TO C TO CAPTURE
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS
MM-HMM
HMM
SO YOU YOU WOULD YOU C YOU CAN UH LINK LIKE THIS
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
TAPE FREE
TAPE FREE
D. V. TAPE FREE
YES
MM-HMM
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU THEY USE MORE OR LESS IN T. N. O. ALSO
THEY DIDN'T HAVE UH TAPES
BUT WITH DIFFERENT CARDS
THEY HAD SOMETHING
FOR THE AMI PROJECT
HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
BECAUSE THE SYNCHRONIZATION PROBLEM COMES FROM THE THE GRABBING FROM THE D. V. TAPE IN IN D IN D. VIX
SO IT'S AFTERWARDS
MM
OH NO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE YEAH
MM THEY DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH FUN GRABBING
THE PROBLEM IS WAS THAT IT WAS NOT SYNCHRONIZED
SO THE TIME CODE WAS WRONG FOR FOR THE DIFFERENT VIDEOS
THEY HAD THE UH UH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO YOU IF YOU SAW THE TIME CODE IT WAS SIX HOURS NI UH FIFTY MINUTES
AND H THERE FOUR HOURS THIRTY TWO MINUTES
SO IT'S IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TIME CODE
WELL THAT'S WHAT THEY DID UH MANUALLY AFTER THE AFTERWARDS
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH FRAME DROPS IN FACT
NO THEY D YEAH YEAH YEAH I'M SURE
BECAUSE
WELL IT'S MANUAL TO TO SYNCHRONIZE IT THE FRAME
YEAH THAT'S WHAT THEY DID
NO NO BECAUSE UH WE DID THE SOFTWARE HERE AND IT THEY DIDN'T CHOO NO OUR UH SOFTWARE
PACKET
AND THIS IS NO NO NO
AND THIS IS DONE AT THE UM YOU HAVE LIBRARIES
ET ET CETERA TO TO CHOO WELL UH A ALL YOU YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT UH ASKING ABOUT BAND WIDTH ET CETERA
IT TH WHEN Y UH YOU USE A SYSTEM UM HARDWARE
YEAH YEAH
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO CODE ALL THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS ET CETERA
SO JUST FOR EXPLANATION
MM-HMM
YES
OKAY
YEAH
SO WE NEED UH WELL THIS IS WILL BE DONE TOGETHER T LIKE IN TO TO TRY TO DIVIDE THE TIME UH WHAT DO WE DO
UM WE WE DON'T WANT TODAY TO TO PUT DEADLINES YOU KNOW
BUT UM WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE CAN DO AND HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO
I WAS THINKING UH FOR INSTANCE UH IN TH IN WHAT WE HAVE UM UH BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT UM USING UH LIKE UH D. L. L.
M. F. C. UH UH MICROSOFT SOFTWARE
BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO TO GO WITH THAT
AND UH SO WHAT WE HAVE UNTIL NOW IS THE SOFTWARE THAT DARREN DID FOR THE FRAME GRABBING
AND AND ACTUALLY I C UM I CAN START PLAYING AND UH LOOKING AT THE THIS UH IN DETAIL
SO DARREN SOFTWARE
ABOUT UM FRAME GRABBING
SUP I SUPPOSE M. F. C. C. NO UH NOT M. F. C. C. BUT M. E M. F. C.
YOU HEARD OF THAT
AND UH D. L. L. ET CETERA
THE ALL THE WINDOWS UH UH PRO PROGRAMMING
UM SO THIS IS ONE UH STEP
THEN UM THE AUDIO VIDEO CARD UM SO SO UH FIRST UH WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS
TO LOOK AT THE DEMOS THAT ARE UH I WITH THE WHAT THEY CALL THE S. D. K. UH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT
UH DEMOS TEST
UM TESTING THE CARD WITH UH ONLY ONE AUDIO FOR INSTANCE AND THEN ONLY ONE VIDEO
AND E EVEN UH TESTING WITH ONLY THE SLIDES UH TO CAPTURE ALL THE UH LIKE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING THE THE S UH THE VIDEO S UH STREAM
WELL SLIDE STREAM
THE FRAME
YOU MEAN THE FRAME GRABBING CARD
YEAH
THEY HAVE S. D. K. UH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT THAT IS BASED ON UH M. F. C. LIBRARIES AND C. PLUS PLUS LIBRARIES
OKAY
OKAY
SO ONCE YOU WE'VE TESTED THE INDIVIDUALLY THE CARD WE CAN TEST TO SYNCHRONIZE THE AUDIO AND THE VIDEO TOGETHER
OR IS IT NO IT'S SYNCHRONIZED
OR OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
AND THE I TH NOW WE ARE
AS YOU SAID UH WHAT NOT NOW BUT UH THE NEXT POINT WOULD BE TO USE THAT CARD WITH THE OTHER CARD AND TO MERGE THE SLIDE SIGNAL WITH THE
WELL UM THE S UH YEAH THE SYNCHRONIZATION SIGNAL COMING FROM THE FRAME GRABBING CARD
IT'S UH IT'S IT'S NOT A SYNCHRONIZATION SIGNAL IT'S A SLIDE WITH A T
OUI OUI
YEAH WE WILL
AND IS IS IT EXTERNAL TO THIS CARD
IT'S EXTERNAL
OR IT'S I
SO IT'S EXTERNAL
IT'S NOT IN THIS UH CARD
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY THAT
OR WELL UH TO TO UH AT LEAST THE BASIC
OKAY
AND THAT WILL WILL UH WILL BE WILL HELP US TO SYNCHRONIZE THE THIS FRAME GRABBING CARD AND THIS VIDEO CARD
SO UH T YEAH WE NEED TO DO SOME TESTS
READING AND YEAH
OKAY
AND THEN WHEN WE HAVE OKAY
WHERE DO WE DO THAT
HE WE DON'T KNOW YET WITH FRANK IF WE INSTALL THIS CARD MAYBE HERE
OKAY AND AT IDIAP IT'S POSSIBLE THERE
OKAY
MM-HMM
WELL ON MY MACHINE HIS MACHINE OR THIS MACHINE MAYBE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
ISSUE
SO YEAH
UH UH MM
YEAH CHRISTMAS TWO SEVEN
NO NO
UM YEAH THAT'S GOOD QUESTION
YEAH ALEXANDRE DID NOT CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE WAY UH YOU I NO NO NO BUT UH YOU ARE MORE IN RESEARCH
MM-HMM
OKAY I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING THAT MM UH WELL WE'RE NOT D DOING DEADLINES
BUT UH YEAH
MM YEAH
NO NO
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YE WELL WE WOULD LOOK BOTH AT
BECAUSE WE ARE ALSO BOTH UH QUITE BUSY WITH OTHER PROJECTS OF COURSE
UH E H. F. E. S. DATABASE UH WITH J. FERRET UH
OKAY THIS IS BETWEEN BOTH
YEAH OF COURSE YEAH
READY TO BE USED
YEAH
SO UH
DATA
MM-HMM
YEAH WE YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO YEAH
LET'S SEE
FROM FRO FOR CHECKING DARREN'S CODE ET CETERA WE CAN EXPECT UNTIL UH
AND YEAH FOR O ONE MONTHS OR SO THEN UH THE UH THE I UH I. V. C. UH W WITH THE PEOPLE AT FRIBOURG HAVE UH YEAH
OKAY SO UH AT FRIBOURG WE WE HAVE
MM-HMM
OKAY
AND THEN THE DIRECT SHOW
OR YEAH
SO WE CAN SAY WE TRY TO TO MAKE SOMETHING FOR APRIL
BUT UH WELL I I WANT THIS TO TO WORK IN THE FOR THE TIME UH IN THE MM-HMM

OKAY MAYBE IN FIFTY PERCENT UH ON THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WHY THIS WAS YEAH MO YEAH W I DON'T WANT TO TALK TOO MUCH MAYBE
UH BUT UH WITH SEBASTIEN SORRY THIS WAS MAYBE UH HIS CONCERN

THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO AND I BEFORE COMING HERE I JUST TRIED TO TO MAKE UH UH A PLAN
BUT I DON'T ANSWER YEAH
W WELL THE LET'S SAY UH APRIL O. SIX AND UH WE DO UH OUR BEST WITH UH TRYING TO KEEP YOU INFORM WITH THE ADVANCEMENTS
AND IF WE SEE EARLY THAT CLEARLY UH THERE I
MM-HMM
AND IT SHOULD BE SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE IN C. PLUS PLUS M. F. C.
UH
YEAH
OR A STUDENT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO NO NO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
WELL I WOULD LIKE TO TO TO WORK ON P KIND OF PART TIME UH UH W O YEAH
YEAH
AND ONE FULL DAY A WEEK
AND I WOULD OKAY
MAYBE YOU WON'T LIKE MY ANSWER BUT I WOULD SAY THAT UM WE CH WE WE START BUT WE H WE REALLY HAVE TO START ON WORKING WI UH READING ALL THE CODE FROM DARREN
THEN THIS UM CARD WITH THE CODE I. V. C. CARD AND TO TO TRY THIS
THEN WE TRY A LITTLE BIT DIRECT SHOW TO SEE UM UH TO TO HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW HOW LONG UH THAT COULD BE
AND THEN AT THE MOMENT WE CAN SAY OKAY WE NEED SOMEONE TO HELP US
WELL W UH LET'S DO THAT
LET'S DO THAT
OKAY
FO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM YEAH
TO
SO WITHOUT DIRECT SHOW YOU MEAN THE FRAME GRABBING SIGNAL AND TIME ALIGNMENT
UH WI THAT WOULD BE DONE UH IN LIKE IN COMMON SOFTWARE THAT WE HAVE UH AFTERWARDS
OKAY TH AND THIS POINT IS ABOUT TESTING AND UH YEAH
OKAY
SO YOU COULD SAY OKAY LET'S FOR CHRISTMAS LET'S TRY THIS WITHOUT THE ALL THE SYNCHRONIZATION
UH WITH DIRECT SHOW ISSUE
OKAY OH YEAH YOU ARE YOU CANNOT OR O L UH BY DOING ONE ONE DAY A WEEK MM YOU KNOW JUST I THINK THE CARDS
OKAY
ANYWAY THE RECORDING IS FINISHED I THINK
YEAH
SO I TRY MY BEST UNTIL JANUARY
AND UM AND I TRY TO DO WHAT JEAN MARC UH DESCRIBED TO GIVE YOU A FIRST FEEDBACK ON THE DIFFERENT CARDS
UH AND UH AND FROM THERE IT WOULD M YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
I WOULD SAY UH LET'S LET'S YEAH LET'S TRY TO HAVE ONE UH STUDENTS UH TO HELP US ON THAT
I DON'T KNOW
THAT IS VERY WELL WE HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER THE STUDENTS IT'S TOO IT'D BE STUPID
BUT UH UH THE THE STUDENT SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT M. F. C. WITH OH OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE D WE HAVE TO TO STOP TALKING YET
BUT UH THE RECORDING HAS FINISHED
MM-HMM
KEEP GOING
YEAH YEAH
SURE THAT'S INTEREST US
IT'S OKAY
IT SHOULD
BUT FOR THE MOMENT JUST FOR THE PURPOSE WELL F FOR THE MOMENT IT'S JUST TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER SO WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT THE UH
YEAH FOR WITH PAS
IT'S OKAY
YEAH GOOD IDEA
UH THIS SOUNDS LIKE ALEXANDRE PAS
YEAH THAT'S NOT THAT
IT'S DIVA
N'EST CE PAS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
BUT L LET BE CAREFUL
THERE'S ONE IMPORTANT POINT
THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAY YOU ACQUIRE THINGS SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY THE KIND OF PROCESSING YOU WANT TO HAVE
SO IN OUR CASE WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD PROCESSING OF SLIDES THAT IN OUR CASE IT MEANS TO TRANSCRIBE WITH AN O. C. R. AND THEN MAKE INDEXING
WE NEED TO HAVE HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGE
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN BY PRECISION RIGHT
SO IN A SENSE THAT'S THE POINT
FOR US WE NEED TO HAVE UH THIS SUFFICIENT RESOLUTION IMAGES OF SLIDES TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO
SO THAT'S WHY I GUESS WE DON'T FOLLOW THAT SOLUTION
BECAUSE APPARENTLY YEAH
MM-HMM
AS FAR AS I KNOW SO FAR UH THEY DID SIMILAR WORKS ON MEETINGS DOCUMENT CENTRED MEETINGS
THEY ALWAYS WORKED ON MANUAL TRANSCRIPTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
SO THEY NEVER REALLY TOOK INTO ACCOUNT A POSSIBILITY OF ACTUALLY PERFORMING PROCESSING ON THE DOCUMENT THEY TALK ABOUT DURING THE MEETING DURING IN THIS CASE THE UH THE TALK
THE CONFERENCE THE THE TH THE PRESENTATION
AS FAR AS I KNOW
AS FAR AS THEY PUBLISHED I KN I KNOW THE RESULTS THEY PUBLISHED UH SO FAR
SO ESSENTIALLY THEY N NEVER TOOK INTO ACCOUNT I MEAN THE WORK AT THE HIGH LEVEL WHICH MEANS BASICALLY WE HAVE THE INFORMATION COMING FROM HERE AND THERE
AND WE N CREATED TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW TO STARTS FROM THE TEXT THERE AND THE THINGS THAT ARE SAID AND W IF WE FIND CONTEXT
I MEAN THEY MAKE SOME KIND OF PROCESSING
BUT AS THEY DON'T WORK ON THE LOW LEVEL SO LOW LEVEL IT MEANS BASICALLY OKAY TAKE THE SPEECH AND EXTRACT THE TRANSCRIPTION
I TAKE THE IMAGE UH OF THE DOCUMENT AND I TAKE THE TRANSCRIPTION
THEY BASICALLY DON'T REALLY CARE OF THIS ASPECT AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND MM
AS FAR AS I KNOW
MM-HMM
YEAH
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
YEAH
YEAH
LET'S SAY THAT IT MAKES UH LESS AUTOMATIC IN THE SENSE THAT AT POINT YOU NEED SOMEONE GIVING THE FILE AND PUTTING THE FILE UPLOAD IN SOMEWHERE ET CETERA
AND IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROCESSING
SOME WAY IS ALWAYS DRIVEN BY W WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO
THEY WORK A LOT ON LAYOUT ANALYSIS
I KNOW THEY MATCH UH UH THE LAYOUT IN TWO X. M. L. FILES ET CETERA
SO IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF APPROACHING THE PROBLEM WHICH MEANS A DIFFERENT WAY OF CAPTURING DIFFERENT EXIGENCIES IN IN CAPTURING THE THE DOCUMENTS YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
MM-HMM
I IT'S THE SAME AS AS YOU HAVE IN THE PICTURE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEP
DEFINITELY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
ACQUISITION
MM-HMM
TAPE FREE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
MM YEAH
NOW BASICALLY WE HAVE ALL THIS KIND OF GENERAL VIEW ABOUT ALL THE SYSTEMS MAYBE WE CAN TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK TO OUR SYSTEM
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAD THERE ARE MM WE HAD THE LONG DISCUSSION AND FINALLY WE DECIDED FOR FOR ONE APPROACH
AND MAYBE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK JUST A MOMENT UH AT WHAT POINT WE ARE AND W WHEN WE PLAN BASICALLY TO GET SOMETHING UH DONE AND WORKING
I CAN ADD TO THAT LIST OF PROJECT IS SOMETHING THAT JEAN MARC AND ME WE HAVE FOUND IN THE LITERATURE
THERE IS F. X. THAT IS DOING SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO TO WHAT WE DO HERE BASICALLY
A CAPTURE THROUGH THE PROJECTOR SIGNAL OF THE SLIDES AND THEY FOR THE MOMENT THEY JUST PLAN TO USE THE SLIDES AS A AS A WAY TO INDEX THE PRESENTATIONS
BUT BUT UH ROUGHLY IS IS AN IDEA THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO TO OUR IDEA
SO WELL ESSENTIALLY NOW WE HAVE THE MATERIAL AS FAR I'M AS I'M UNDERSTOOD
UH AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO TELL US ROUGHLY WHEN DO YOU THINK UH WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOMETHING WORKING
MM-HMM
ISSUES YEAH
MM CAREFUL BECAUSE THE UH I LISTENED TO FRANK AND APPARENTLY DON'T WANT TO BUY A NEW MACHINE BEFORE WE SHOW THAT THIS WORKS
SO WE HAVE TO USE MATERIAL THAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE
MAYBE THERE IS SOME FREE MA MACHINE THAT IS NOT
OKAY S SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE OTHER MACHINES ACTUALLY YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
SOME OF UH SOME OTHER MACHINE YEAH
MM-HMM
SO MM IN TERMS OF TIME WHAT WE CAN THINK
WHEN WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE
CHRISTMAS GIFT OR
EARLY NEW YEAR GIFT
UH
BUT THE WAY OF COURSE I'M I I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT UH THE WORK INVOLVES
SO IS THIS UH NO THAT'S NOT THAT I DON'T CARE
BUT UH I D I DON'T UNDERSTAND SOME WAY EXACTLY
I THINK THE THE THE REAL POINT IS WHEN
ROUGHLY
I MEAN I I DON'T SAY WELL NO NO NO
I DON'T WANNA PUT A DEADLINE
UH BUT UH GIVEN THE CURRENT UH MATERIAL WE HAVE UM MM GIVEN YOUR ACTIVITIES BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU BOTH ARE INVOLVE IN MANY OTHER THINGS
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU YEAH AS JEAN MARC SAID IS CHRISTMAS AND UH SO WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE CHRISTMAS GIFT
OR IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SAY IS CHRISTMAS TWO THOUSAND SIX
SO I I I DEFINITELY JUST WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING VERY ROUGH ON WHEN YOU EXPECT TO FINISH THIS
THAT'S PROBLEM
UH THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM
I MEAN DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING FOR THE VERY NEXT MONTHS
DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING FOR THE END OF NEXT YEAR
DO YOU THINK SP
MM
SO IS FOR SO HALF NEXT YEAR
SO JUNE JUNE JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX
RE RESULTS WHAT DOES IT MEAN
THE END OF THIS
SO IT WORKS IT DOESN'T WORK
YOU KNOW FOR FOR ME WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHEN IT IS READY TO BE USE
SO WHEN I CAN SAY START COLLECTING DATA UH I START USING
I START PLAYING WITH THIS
BASICALLY THE PROCESS IS READY AND WE CAN START HAVING OUR DEMO
AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE IS A RISK THAT UH WE SUBMITTED A PROJECT MAYBE IT WILL BE REJECTED WE DON'T KNOW
BUT POTENTIALLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STUDENT SUPPOSED TO WORK IN THIS
IT WILL BE NO NOT BEFORE APRIL TWO THOUSAND SIX ANYWAY
BUT UH YOU KNOW MM SOME WAY WE WE WE WE CANNOT HAVE A STUDENTS AND MAKE HIM WAIT ONE YEAR BEFORE HE HAS UH THE MATERIAL TO WORK
SO MY POINT IS WHEN
REASONABLY
UH ROUGHLY I DON'T DON'T DON'T WANNA HAVE AND IT'S NOT A DEADLINES OUI
BUT WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE THE SYSTEM READY TO WORK UH WORKING
YEP
MM-HMM
TOGETHER
SO THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN PROBLEM AS FAR AS AS I UNDERSTAND
MM-HMM
UH MAKE SOMETHING RE THAT YOU ARE USING VERY VAGUE EXPRESSION
RESULT MAKE SOMETHING
JUST JUST UH JUST TELL ME WHEN IT IS READY
AND IF YOU THINK IT'S IT'S NOT BEFORE UH BUT BUT MUST BE REASONABLE I M I MEAN IF YOU THINK IT WILL BE NOT BEFORE DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX
SAY DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX
SO DON'T TRY TO TELL ME MARCH OR APRIL I W IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT IT IS UNREALISTIC TO SAY THAT
MUST BE REALISTIC
YOU SAY JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX WE KNOW IT IS JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIX
UH I KNOW
SURE
SURE
BUT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL BUT THERE IS NO DAY TO RESPECT
IT'S JUST TO KNOW I MEAN AND IF YOU CAN HAVE EARLY EARLY WARNINGS IN THE SENSE THAT IF YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A MAJOR UH PROBLEM SOMEWHERE
BUT IS JUST TO KNOW IN THE SENSE THAT REALLY UH THIS P THIS MM THING HAS BEEN STOP NOW FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
UH UH IT N IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL
NOW WE HAVE IT
IT'S SOMETHING THAT UH IS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
WE SEE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE WORKING ET CETERA
WE ARE GOING TO LOSE IT SOME WAY IF UH IF WE DON'T PUT SOME AND VERY HONESTLY YEAH
I I IT'LL IT'LL NOT BE
THIS IS INNOVATION YEAH
UH YOU KNOW IN A SENSE I NEVER TRIED FOR EXAMPLE EVENTUALLY TO ASK FOR ONE PERSON DEDICATED TO THIS BECAUSE I ALWAYS HAD THE FEELING THAT YOU ARE VERY INTERESTED
YOU WANTED TO DO IT IT'S SOMETHING YOU SOME WAY YOU UH I MEAN IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS INTERESTING TO YOU
BUT UH IF YOU HAVE NOT THE TIME AND THE POSSIBILITY TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU YOU BOTH ARE INVOLVED IN MANY OTHER THINGS
WE CAN EVENTUALLY TRY TO ASK TO HAVE ONE PERSON TO INVOLVE ONE PERSON THAT WILL BE DEDICATED STRICTLY TO THIS
WE CAN TRY
I MEAN WE CAN ASK UH UH IN THE SENSE THAT IF IT IS A PRIORITY FOR IDIAP SO FAR WE WOULD GET VERY GOOD SIGNALS FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW
I I DON'T KNOW
BUT UH PLEASE IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE ENERGY TO DO IT
UH OR IT INVOLVES TOO MANY THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT KEEP UNDER CONTROL GIVEN THE OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO
UH DON'T THINK THAT OKAY SOMETHING NICE WE WE CAN WAIT OR SOONER OR LATER IT WILL HAPPEN
UH YEAH
EXACTLY
SO I THINK IT'S THE MOMENT UH FOR YOU TO REALLY REALISE TRY TO TO HAVE A REALISTIC UH DATE
AND IF YOU THINK THERE ARE TOO MANY THINGS THAT YOU RISK TO LOSE CONTROL UH TELL IT NOW
AND WE CAN TRY TO SAY WELL WE WANT TO DO IT BUT UH BASICALLY MAEL AND OLIVIER WERE THE PERSON MM-HMM
NO NO
BUT BUT YOU CAN BE INVOLVE IN A DIFFERENT WAY
I MEAN YOU CAN EVENTUALLY HAVE UH A SUPERVISION ROLE IN THE SENSE THAT YOU THINK THAT I I KNOW HOW TO DO IT
I LIKE TO DO IT BUT I HAVE NO TIME
BECAUSE AT A CERTAIN POINT IT'S A MATTER OF TIME
WE CAN TRY TO TO ASK
UH BUT UH PLEASE JUST DON'T KEEP THIS AS A KIND OF THING
YEAH I LIKE TO DO IT I LIKE IT IT'S NICE ET CETERA
YEAH
YEAH BU BUT BUT HERE YOU HAVE TO TAKE A RESPONSIBILITY
YOU CAN'T SAY I LIKE TO DO IT AND BUT THEN AH BUT I WILL DO IT WHEN I CAN
EXACTLY
MM-HMM
UH YEAH YEAH YEAH
OKAY THIS IS YEAH
NO NO
OKAY SO NOW IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY I CANNOT FIND TIME
IF YOU CAN'T FIND TIME YOU HAVE TO SAY IT NOW
AND THIS IS ALSO FOR YOU
I MEAN I IT'S NOT AN ACCUSATION
WE WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME CONDITION
MM-HMM
EXACTLY
MM-HMM
S S
SO LET ME POSE THE QUESTION VERY BROADLY
DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE A PERSON THAT HAS THIS WILL HELP YOU
WE CAN ASK WE CAN TRY TO ASK MAYBE IF SOME PERSON FOR SIX MONTHS SO THAT YOUR ROLE IS SIMPLY TO HELP AND ADVISE
WE CAN TRY TO ASK
I MEAN
S
I'M SORRY BUT YOU STILL DON'T ANSWER TO MY MY QUESTION
YOU ARE NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTION
YEAH
LET ME POSE AGAIN THE QUESTION VERY CLEARLY
IF I GO TO HERVE I CAN TRY AND SAY WE ARE IN THIS SITUATION APPARENTLY
WHY DON'T WE TAKE ONE PERSON THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS FOUR MONTHS THAT DIRECTLY ADVISED BY OLIVIER AND UH AND WE CAN SPEED UP
CONSIDER THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO FIND THEM ET CETERA AND SO ON
DO YOU THINK IT'S AN OPTION
MM-HMM
AT EACH
YEAH I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE YEAH
DO YOU THINK IT'S A REASONABLE OPTION
DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT UH CAN HELP YOU
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A MATTER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU GUYS TO BUT THERE IS NOTHING BAD IF YOU SAY YOU HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL UH FULL OF WORK
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ADDED ON THE TOP
UH IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TIME GUYS
I MEAN THIS IS UH BUT PLEASE JUST TELL ME
WE WILL FIND THE TIME HOWEVER
SO APRIL O. SIX YOU WILL HAVE YOUR SYSTEM
OR NO WE ARE NOT SURE
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
UH IT CAN HAPPEN THAT WE DON'T
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO FIND ON THE WAY
MAYBE WE THINK IT TAKES ONE WEEK AND THEN IT TAKES ONE MONTH
UH W WE DON'T KNOW
UH MAYBE WE WILL S WE WI WILL NOT ABLE TO BE CONTINUOUS
BECAUSE ONE OF THE WRONGEST THING IS TO WORK ONE WEEK THEN ONE MONTH NO ET CETERA
THAT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT BREAKS
I MEAN DIFFICULT HUH
MM SO THAT'S THE POINT
SO THAT WHICH DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE EXCLUDED F FROM THE THING IN THE SENSE THAT IN ANY CASE SOMEONE WILL ASK WILL HAVE TO ADVISE THE PERSON EVENTUALLY
AND IT CAN'T BE HIM IT CAN'T BE ME
IT CAN BE YOU THAT BASICALLY FOLLOW ADVISE HELPS
BUT AT LEAST THE MASS OF THE WORK WILL BE DONE BY SOMEONE ELSE THAT CAN SPEND A HUNDRED PERCENT OF TIME ON THAT
NOW IT'S NOT EVEN GUARANTEED IN THE SENSE THAT I CAN ASK THIS
I CAN SAY THAT WELL THIS IS THE SITUATION AND UH YOU ARE
OR EVENTUALLY YEAH SOMEONE CAN SAY OKAY NOW THIS BECOME YOUR PRIORITY
FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE AND GO WITH THAT
I DON'T KNOW
OR WILL TELL YOU OKAY UH JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX BUT FROM JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX YOU DO NOTHING ELSE THAN THIS
YOU KNOW W WE CAN FIND THE TIME WHETHER IT IS YOUR TIME WHETHER IT IS THE TIME OF SOMEONE ELSE
BUT UH I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO STOP WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL MONTHS THAT YOU SAY WE LIKE WE WANT
AND I'M SURE I BELIEVE YOU
BUT THEN IT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT MUST BE DONE OUTSIDE UH THE UH NORMAL ACTIVITY
UM I'M UH I'M SORRY
YEAH
BUT BUT UH OTHERWISE I MEAN AS YOU SAY TO DO IT IN TWO YEARS P
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU LIKE THAT I TRY TO TO TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND TRY TO SAY THAT THERE IS A TIME PROBLEM AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO DO IT
OKAY
BUT THAT CAN BE
BUT UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT CAN BE TOLERABLE YEAH
YEAH
EXACTLY
IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEP
UH I NO
LET ME
THAT SEEMS TO ME CLEAR
UNTIL JANUARY IS UH IS BUSY
SO
SO YEAH
JUST TO GO TO A CONCLUSION BECAUSE APPARENTLY YEAH
SO IT CAN'T WORK UH YEAH EXACTLY
CAN'T WORK UH UNTIL JANUARY
SO IT'S UP TO YOU
IT'S UP TO YOU TO EVALUATE YEAH
MM-HMM
AND THEN WE D MAKE A DECISION IN THE SENSE WHETHER YOU CONTINUE WORKING OR WE TRY TO FIND THE TIME IN A DIFFERENT WAY OR WE TRY TO ELIMINATE YOUR OTHER PRIORITIES YOU'RE UNDER
HMM
YEP
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFERENT PROBLEM
THE PROBLEM IS REALLY UP TO YOU GUYS WHETHER YOU THINK IT'S GOOD TO HAVE ONE PERSON
TRY TO HAVE THAT BECAUSE UH I CANNOT SAY WE HAVE TRIED TO HAVE
W EXACTLY IT WI BUT BETTER NO PERSON THAN A BAD PERSON ANYWAY
YEAH
OKAY
THANKS
YEAH
YEAH
UM A LITTLE BIT BUT UH I'M M I'M NOT SURE HE KNOWS UH EVERYTHING
SO UH BASICALLY UH WELL
FIRST WE TRIED TO UM EXPLAIN WHY IN THIS UH RESC UH N. BEST LIST RE SCORING UH FROM THE SLIDES TO ENHANCE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION ON THE MEETINGS DATA IS NOT WORKING
SO UM UH THAT'S ONE THING
AND UH SO WHAT WE DID WITH ALESSANDRO IS UH UM CH T UH PERFORMING SOME STATISTICAL TESTS TO SEE WHATEVER R IF THE IF THE WORDS UH THE THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORDS DURING THE MEETING IS UH IN INDEPENDENT OF THE AP APPEARANCES OF THE DIFFERENT SLIDES
SO THE IN THE CASE IF IT IS DEPENDENT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT CERTAIN WORDS TEND TO APPEAR DURING CERTAIN SLIDES AND THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION AND UH THEN THERE WILL BE UH A REASON LIKE FOR BELIEVING THAT UH THIS WILL WORK
THE RESU THE RESULT WAS NO
YEAH TRUE
YEAH ALMOST NOTHING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HUH
SO MATTHEW WE WERE UH YEAH
IT'S UH WE WERE TALKING THAT WE DID SOME EXPERIMENTS TO SEE IF THE WORD DURING MEETING THE WORDS APPEAR INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SLIDES IN A SENSE THAT UH IF CERTAIN WORDS TEND TO APPEAR DURING CERTAIN SLIDES OR NO
AND UH THE ANSWER IS UH NO
AND UH SO WE DID A STATISTICAL TEST FOR THAT
AND I WILL ADD ALSO THAT WE DID THAT ON THE UH W THE WORDS AFTER FILTERING THEM FROM THE REMOVING THE THE STOP WORDS
YEAH SO UH SO UH BEC S BECAUSE YEAH
WITH THE STOP WORDS OKAY TH THERE WOULD BE A REASON FOR UH IN INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE THERE IS UH SUCH A HUGE MESS OF THEM
BUT UH EVEN UH AFTER REMOVING THEM UH THERE IT IT REMAINS UH INDEPENDENT
AND ACTUALLY UH SO WHEN I WAS DOING THE RE SCORING EXPERIMENTS I WAS DOING THAT ON UH ONE MEETING THAT I SELECTED AS BEING LIKE THE BEST LOOKING ONE
UH IT HA IT HAD THE M THE MOST UH SLIDES
AND NOW I DID THE SAME UH ON UH THE OTHER MEETINGS WHICH WERE AVAILABLE WHERE WELL IT'S ONLY THREE MEETINGS BECAUSE WELL HERE THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM WHICH ARE FROM THE TEST SET UH FROM THE AMI RECOGNISER W BUT ONLY THREE OF THEM HAVE UH SLIDES
SO IT'S TOTAL OF THREE MEETINGS AND FOR THE OTHERS THE TENDENCY AND I C 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I WAS WHEN I WAS DOING RE SCORING
I WAS UH TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FOR ONE GIVEN SLIDE ALSO THE N NEIGHBOURING SLIDES
AND AS I WAS IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SLIDES WHICH WERE AFFECTING THE THE UTTERANCE I WAS RE SCORING UM THE PERFORMANCE WAS IMPROVING SLI S UH SLIGHTLY
VERY VERY LITTLE
BUT UH
YEAH
UH THE THE FIRST THING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EX THE EXPERIMENT TO SEE THE UH IF IT'S DEPENDENT OR INDEPENDENT
HOW WE DID IT
UH SO WE USED THE PEARSON UH CHI SQUARE UH TEST NO
AH OKAY
IT WAS TO TO SEE IF UH CERTAIN WORDS HAVE A TENDENCY TO APPEAR DURING UH UH THEY IF THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO APPEAR DURING CERTAIN SLIDES
W
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT WAS NO
AND S SO WHEN EXTENDING THE THOSE EXPERIMENTS TO THE OTHER MEETINGS UH WHEN WHILE I WAS OBSERVING AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE FIRST MEETING I WAS USING
UH SO I WAS R OBSERVING AN IMPROVEMENT AS I WAS INCREASING UM LIKE THE UM THE CONTEXT
YEAH
UH
ON THE ON THE RECOGNITION YEAH
SO THERE WAS UH THE IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO INCREASING AS I WAS INCREASING THE CONTEXT
WHILE ON THE OTHER MEETINGS IT'S UM IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY FLUCTUATING AND UH I IT IT UH IT LOOKS MORE LIKE UM UH PS UH WELL
WHAT'S THE WORD FOR THAT
STATISTICAL UM UM FLUCTUATION
SO UH
MM-HMM
HUH
MM-HMM
EXACTLY
SO THAT'S WHY UM UH IF WE LOOK ON THE RELATIONSHIP THAT UH EXISTS BETWEEN THE SPEECH AND THE SLIDES UH THE TASK OF IMPROVING THE RECOGNITION
UH THE OVERALL UM SP UH SPEECH RECOGNITION USING THE SLIDES UH SEEMS TO BE UH UH NOT VERY UH UM GOOD
I MEAN UM WE CANNOT EXPECT MUCH FROM FROM IT
MM WELL FOR NOW THE UH MOST EFFORT WAS UH ON UH UM SHOWING WHY I IT'S I IT'S IT WILL NOT WORK
ESPECIALLY THOSE EXPERIMENTS AND THESE UH STATISTICAL TESTS
BUT UH WE W WERE THINKING FOR EXAMPLE OF A TASK LIKE UM TRYING TO UH SEE IF UH WHERE A SPEAKER IS TALKING I MEAN IF THE SPEECH IS ACTUALLY CORRELATED WITH THE SLIDES UH WHERE THE SLIDES UH WHICH HAPPEN DURING THE NOT CORRELATED
BUT IF THE
UH WELL IF THE UM
IF THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE SLIDES OR NOT
INDICATOR
YEAH OR FOR EXAMPLE UH WHAT HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE OF THE MEETINGS IS THAT P PEOPLE WERE UM SUMMARIZING THE THE RESULTS OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING
YOU KNOW
SO IN THE BEGINNING SO THE MEETING STARTED WITH THE SUMMARY OF WHAT HAPPENED UH PREVIOUS TIME AND THIS WAS NOT RELATED TO WHAT WAS ON THE SLIDES
LINK UH
BUT THIS IS ONE YEAH
HUH
MM-HMM
YEAH IT WAS RECYCLING UH KIND OF
TASK
HUH
HUH
EVEN SUMMARIZATION
OR
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
UH NO
NO
BUT FOR THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW UH UH THE ALTERNATIVE MEASURES
OR MAYBE WE SHOULD FINISH WITH THIS FIRST
UH I MEAN UH
YEAH THIS UH THIS WOULD BE A F UH ANOTHER SUBJECT I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS
S BUT UH W BUT UH UH BASICALLY JU JUST YOU KNOW IF WE FINISH UH DISCUSSING THIS FIRST
MM-HMM
THIS IS NOT CLEARLY DEFINED YET
BUT UH UM SOMETHING UM USING THIS RELATIONSHIP UH BETWEEN THE SLIDES UH AND OTHER EVEN OTHER TEK TEXTUAL SUPPORT AND THE UH AND THE SPEECH
HUH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH SURE
WELL THIS IS UM THE
QUESTION I'M WORKING ON
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
YEAH THAT THAT COULD BE INTERESTING TO TRY TO MERGE THOSE TWO UH THINGS
UH YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH AND I UM UH
ARE THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THAT OR NO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM YEP
YEAH THAT'S WHAT WHAT IS MISSING
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
NO
AMI MEETING
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
IT'S A FIRST STEP
HMM
HMM
AND WE COULD UH DO AUTOMATICAL UH SPEAKER RATING IF THERE ARE GOOD SPEAKERS OR BAD SPEAKERS DEPENDING IF THEY JUST READ UH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MAYBE POSSIBLE SOMEDAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL UH DID TRYING TO REALLY DETERMINE THE UM THE UM UH SUBJECT OF SOMETHING FOR MY PROPOSAL I MEAN
YEAH ARO AROUND FEBRUARY OR MARCH
SO REALLY UM
YEAH
SO TO FIND SOMETHING FOR THAT
UH ALSO WITH THE TH THINKING MAYBE TURNING THIS UH WORK INTO PUBLICATION THE ONE ABOUT THE FOR SURE
AND UH ALSO UH UH WELL THAT UH DEPENDS A LITTLE ON ON ON YOU
BUT TRY TO FINISH WITH THE UM MEASURES AND THE CALL ROUTING
'CAUSE I WAS TALKING WITH THAT UH ABOUT THAT TO HERVE UH SINCE I WAS UH I WILL RECYCLE THIS POSTER FOR I. M. TWO
YOU KNOW ABOUT UH ABOUT THIS
AND UH THAT COULD BE COOL TO TO FINISH IT
MAYBE FUSE IT WITH UH IAN'S WORK AND UH DO A JOURNAL PAPER HE WAS SUGGESTING
SO SO YOU'RE SO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT YOU YOU NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU UM TRIED OTHER FEATURES AND UH
BECAUSE AND INITIALLY IT WAS A S NUANCE TRAINED ON NUANCE UH NO
OR
MM-HMM
RUN RUN RUN WHAT EXACTLY
FOR THE THE THE CALL ROUTING ITSELF OR THE RECOGNITION UH THE PHONEME RECOGNITION
YEAH
I HAVE ALL UH JEAN YVES'S UH SCRIPTS AND UH PROGRAMS FOR PERFORMING THE CALL UH ROUTING I THINK UH STARTING FROM THE PHONEME SEQUENCES
YEAH I I KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THE CLUSTER
YEAH IF IT'S JUST RUNNING A SCRIPT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
BUT THIS IS BASICALLY DETECTING SPEECH AND NO NON SPEECH
YEAH
IT'S THIS UH PROBLEM I HEAR EVERY TIME ON THE SPEECH MEETING HOW DO WE DETECT SPEECH AND NOT SPEECH
AH AND UH
OR OH OKAY
IT'S NOT JUST SPEECH AND SILENCE
IT'S SPEECH AND AND OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT WHO REALLY CAN DO UH WHEN SOMEBODY WILL REALLY BE ABLE TO DO THAT
I MEAN DETECT THE SPEECH FROM NON SPEECH IT WILL BE A LITTLE REVOLUTION NO IN THE
MM-HMM
YEAH WELL THIS IS BASICALLY IN MY THREE UH MAIN JOBS UH PROPOSAL UH UM THIS
AH YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT YEAH
AH YEAH SURE
BUT UH UH UH SHOULDN'T MAKE IT CLEARER BEFORE ON THE ON THE ON WHAT UH I I WILL WRITE
AND EVEN UH A FIRST UH UH SUBMISSION USING THIS WORK UM WILL MAKE THINGS CLEARER FOR ME UH WRITING THEM DOWN AND F FOR IT WILL HELP I THINK FOR THAT ALSO
MM
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL I THINK UH FIRST UH THIS SUBMITTED AND THIS WILL HELP FOR THE PROPOSAL
AND SINCE UH WE CANNOT START IMMEDIATELY WITH THE MEASURES I THINK THAT'S THE BEST THING TO DO
MM WELL NO
WELL FOR ME IT'S I THINK WE UH IT'S FINE
YEAH AND I THINK UH THAT WILL BE EXACTLY ONE HOUR AND UH UH FILL THE TAPE
UH THE TAPE IS SIXTY MINUTES
AH SO I WAS RIGHT
AH YEAH
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY WE START WAITING FOR PEOPLE COMING LATE AND UH I CAN SAY THIS BECAUSE IN THIS MOMENT YOU CANNOT ANSWER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MICROPHONE
SO I CAN SAY WHATEVER AND YOU CANNOT REPLY
SO YEAH
YE
IN MY OPINION IT IS NO BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE LANGUAGE
I MEAN INTUITIVELY OF COURSE YOU TEND TO USE MORE THE WORDS THAT ARE ON THE SLIDE
BUT THE MASS OF THE WORDS ACTUALLY YOU USE ARE WORDS THAT ARE COMMON
JUST THINK THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORDS ON AVERAGE WHATEVER CORPUS YOU TAKE ARE STOP WORDS ARTICLES ET CETERA
SO IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION FIFTY PERCENT GOES AWAY
OF THE REST UH REMAINING FIFTY PERCENT I MEAN ARE ALL WORDS THAT APPEAR ONE TWO THREE TIMES
SO IN ANY CASE EVEN IF ACTUALLY AND THEY TEND TO BE UH RELATED OR A STATISTICALLY RELATED TO A SINGLE SLIDE IN ANY CASE IN TERMS OF UH RECOGNITION DO NOT HELP AT ALL OR HELP A VERY LITTLE
SO UH THAT'S THE KIND OF THING UH I MEAN THAT'S THE KIND OF MEASURE THE IND STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE IS NOT ON SINGLE WORDS
HMM
YOU KNOW
EVEN IF ACTUALLY I REMEMBER I JUST MADE SOME MEASURE UH SAYING OKAY L LET'S LOOK AT HOW MANY WORDS I DON'T HAVE IN THE DICTIONARY AND ARE IN THE SLIDES
IT WAS TWO PERCENT
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
SO SOME IN SOME SENSE IT INTUITIVELY IT SOUNDS VERY GOOD
BUT IN PRACTICAL TERMS IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION UH HERE WE WE WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR
IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION THAT IM IMPROVES VERY SLIGHTLY
UH IT IS DIFFERENT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE OTHER TASKS WHERE THE ONLY WORDS THAT ALL ARE WORDS
IN THAT CASE EVEN THE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS UH HE GETS AT THAT POINT THEY CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE
BUT DOES THE RECOGNITION
AND SOME WAY THE STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE I THINK IT CAN BE A GOOD EXPLANATION TO SHOW WHY IT IS HAPPEN EVEN IF IT IS COUNTERINTUITIVE
BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS BASICALLY
YEAH
MM-HMM
BE BE B BE CAREFUL IT'S NOT EXACTLY THIS BECAUSE FOR SURE THERE ARE WORDS THAT TEND TO BE
SO THE POINT IS YOU WANT TO VERIFY WHETHER YOU CAN IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION RATE BY USING AS AN INFORMATION THE WORDS THAT UH ARE CONTAIN IN THE SLIDES
SO BASICALLY THE IDEA IS THAT UH IN THE MOMENT YOU ARE IN THE SLIDE SOMEWHERE YOUR LANGUAGE CHANGE ACCORDINGLY TO THE SLIDE
SO THE FACT OF HAVING THAT INFORMATION SOMEWHERE CAN HELP YOU TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION
BUT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS
AND THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN FOR MANY REASON
FIRST FOR EXAMPLE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORDS IN ANY KIND OF TEXT ARE STOP WORDS
SO ARE EVERYWHERE
AND THE REMAINING A APPEAR SO LITTLE THAT IN THE CASE CANNOT REALLY IMPROVE THAT MUCH
MOST OF THE WORDS WE USE ACTUALLY WHATEVER WE TALK ABOUT ARE COMMON UH WORDS
SO HOW TO VERIFY THIS
I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN MEASURED ET CETERA BUT STILL IS A BIT QUALITATIVE
TO HAVE A QUANTITATIVE MEASURE MM-HMM WE SIMPLY DID UH A MEASURE OF STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE WORDS IN GENERAL
SO NOT SOME WORDS THE WORDS IN GENERAL
OTHERWISE YOU CAN SEE THAT IF A WORDS APPEAR ONCE BASICALLY IT IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELATED TO ONE SLIDE HUH
BUT YOU HAVE TO I IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION HAVE TO MAKE IT OVERALL
I MEAN WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS NOT THE WORD THAT APPEAR ONCE IT'S THE WORD THAT APPEAR
IF UH I EXACTLY
IF IF THERE IS ONE WORD THAT APPEAR ONCE ALL OVER THE MEETING
IT APPEARS IN CORRESPONDENCE OF ONE SLIDE THEN OF COURSE IT SEEMS TO BE VERY RELATED
BUT VERY FEW WORDS UH THEY REPRESENT A VERY LITTLE PART OF THE WORD MASS MM
SO WE SIMPLY USED A VERY OLD TEST STATISTICAL TEST
THAT BASICALLY MEASURE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SOME WAY THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING ONE WORD IN CORRESPONDENCE OF A CERTAIN SLIDE IS SIMPLY THE PRODUCT OF THE PROBABILITY OF THE WORD FOR THE PROBABILITY OF THE
THAT'S IT
SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID
BUT IS IN GENERAL THE LANGUAGE AND NOT CERTAIN WORDS
BECAUSE CERTAIN WORDS FOR SURE HAVE A STRONG DEPENDENCY ON THE SLIDES
BUT THERE ARE L FEW
YEAH
FLUCTUATIONS
MM-HMM
IT IS NOT IN TERMS I MEAN FOR ME FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS NOT IN THE SENSE THAT UH AFTER WORKING A LITTLE BIT ON LANGUAGE YOU REALISE THAT THIS KIND OF THING DO NOT HELP SIMPLY BECAUSE MOST OF THE WORDS UH HAVE NOTHING TO DO SPECIFICALLY WITH THE SUBJECT YOU USE
UH MOST OF THE WORDS WE USE UH THAT'S STRANGE BUT ARE SIMPLY NECESSARY TO BUILD A SENTENCE
THERE ARE VERY FEW UH CONTENT UH WORDS
BUT IT IS TRUE THAT INTUITIVELY UH AS WE ARE DRIVEN IN OUR ATTENTION UH I MEAN IN IN OUR UNDERSTANDING WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DRIVEN BY ATTENTION
THAT WE TEND TO SPOT ONLY THOSE WORDS
EXACTLY AND IN SOME SENSE INTUITIVELY IT SEEMS THAT IT CAN HAPPEN
I MEAN THIS IS NOT THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS AND IT NEVER WORKS ACTUALLY I IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION
FOR OTHER TASK IT CAN BE UH IT CAN BE UH HELPFUL
YEAH
YEP
BE CAREFUL
CORRELATE IS A DANGEROUS WORD IN STATISTIC
IT SEEMS TO BE THE OPPOSITE AS BEFORE
THE
OR ROUGHLY
BASICALLY UH ONE THING IT CAN'T BE DONE
AND AND HERE UH ON THE CONTRARY FOR EXAMPLE THE FEW WORDS THAT ARE MM HOW MAY I SAY IT RECOGNIZED MORE CAN REALLY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE
IT ISN'T THE CASE IF YOU WANT TO SEE IF UH I MEAN WHAT IF SEEN IN THE MEETING AND THAT OKAY
THERE ARE PRESENTATION
THEN YEAH STILL THE SLIDE IS THERE
BUT ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS
OR NOT REALLY OTHER THINGS BUT THE SLIDE IS NO LONGER UH A SUPPORT FOR THE DISCUSSION HUH
THERE ARE MOMENT THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS THE SUPPORT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DESCRIBE ET CETERA
AND THERE ARE MOMENT WHERE IT IS NOT
IS A JUST A BACKGROUND UH THING
AND WE ROUGH ESTIMATED VERY QUICKLY
BUT IT WAS ONE THIRD OF THE TIME
AT LEAST IN IN THE MEETING WE HAVE SEEN
THE SLIDE WERE JUST THERE I MEAN BUT THEY WERE NO LONGER USE AS A SUPPORT
IT WAS A DISCUSSION RATHER BETWEEN PEOPLE
SO IN THAT CASE THE PRESENCE OR THE ABSENCE AND ESPECIALLY THE FREQUENCE WITH WHICH YOU OBSERVE THE WORDS THAT ARE ON THE SLIDES CAN BE AN EXCELLENT UH UH CLUE
HUH
INDICATION A CLEAR INDICATION WHETHER ACTUALLY DOES IT SUPPORT OF THE DISCUSSION OR NOT
UH IT CAN BE THIS
IT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A KIND OF FOCUS OF INTEREST
IT CAN BE SIMPLY INTERPRETED IN THE SENSE OF SAYING UH OKAY I MEAN YOU HAVE THIS CHANNEL OPEN THERE
DO I HAVE TO P TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT OR NOT
OR ALSO IN TERMS OF ACTION
YEAH UH WHEN YOU SEE THAT S THE DISCUSSION IS COMPLETELY M DISCONNECTED WITH RESPECT TO THIS SOME WAY UH IT MEANS THAT IT'S HAPPEN IN SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE
SO I MEAN IT'S A KIND OF FEATURE THAT IN MY OPINION CAN BE EASY TO DETECT IT AND UM THAT CAN
YEAH UH F CAN BE INTERESTING TO DO
RELATIVELY EASY TO DO
AND UH IN THAT CASE FOR EXAMPLE THE FEW WORDS MM THAT YOU THAT YOU GET MORE CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE
OH SO IS THAT MM DOUBLE WAY TO TO SHOW HOW SOME WAY DEPENDENT ON THE TASK
WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXACTLY
MM-HMM
YEAH
SOME WAY WELL THERE ARE F YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM HMM
YEAH I KNOW THIS WE ARE S S TALKING ABOUT TODAY SHORT TERM IF YOU WANT
UH THINGS JUST TO THE USE THE THINGS
I MEAN ALL THE WORK THEY THAT HAS DONE BASICALLY WHICH IS A HUGE WORK
AND THE DATA WE HAVE THEN UH ENOUGH FOR THE FOR A THESIS OF COURSE IT MUST BE MUCH BETTER
BUT OF COURSE THE THERE'S ONLY TWO TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORDS
SOME OF THEM YOU CAN DO IT ON A SINGLE MEETING
SO THIS KIND OF FEATURE EXTRACTION BECAUSE BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT IT IS SAYING YES NO THIS CHANNEL IS GOOD
NOW IS BACKGROUND
NOW IS FOREGROUND ET CETERA
YOU CAN PUT IT IN THAT IN THAT WAY
THIS YOU DO IT ON A SINGLE MEETING
AND THEN THERE ARE CORPUS UM BASED UM HOW MAY I SAY IT WORKS SO YEAH THAT IS ONE POSSIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE FINDING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT MEETINGS
THEN I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN AT THAT POINT IT BECOMES PRETTY MUCH CRUCIAL THE KIND OF UH DATA YOU HAVE IN THE SENSE THAT FOR THE WAY WE HAVE COLLECTED THE DATA SOME WAY I DON'T KNOW IF IT CAN BE AT THE SAME TIME TOO EASY IN THE SENSE THAT SOME WAY YOU HAVE LITTLE GROUPS OF MEETINGS EXTREMELY CORRELATED
SO I MEAN IT IT MAKES IT EASIER
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH SIGNIFICANT CAN BE AT THAT LEVEL
IT CAN BE
I IN A SENSE
IF YOU WANT UH THIS KIND OF WORDS BECOME INTERESTING WHEN THE CORPUS IS REALLY BIG UH UH WHEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CONSIDER EACH MEETING AS A SINGLE ITEM
SO IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU HAVE TENS HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF MEETINGS WHICH IS NOT THE CASE
BUT I MEAN YOU CAN DO OTHER WORK IF YOU CONSIDER IN TERMS OF SPEAKER TURNS OR IN TERMS OF SLIDES AND THAT IS IMMEDIATELY MULTIPLY
YEAH
YEP YEP
THAT IS ANOTHER
SO IT CAN BE ONE MORE FEATURE THAT HELPS IN BUT IT IS VERY SHORT TERM
I MEAN JUST UH WELL IT IS JU JUST FEW FEW FEW TIMES WE TALK TOGETHER AND IT WAS JUST
MEAN THE VERY QUICK THING YOU CAN CAN HAVE UH LIKE THIS
MM-HMM
BUT I THINK IN A SENSE IN MY OPINION WELL THERE ARE TWO THINGS
WHEN THIS UH STATISTICAL TEST IT CAN BE WE HAVE MADE AN EXPERIMENT WE GET A RESULT SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVE WE GIVE AN EXPLANATION
AND UH THAT'S IT
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SOME WAY CLOSES HERE
SO WHEN IT GIVES YOU THE KIND OF ANSWER YOU GET IS THAT OKAY TO GO IN THAT IN THAT DIRECTION MAYBE IS NOT THE BEST THING
MAYBE TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION THAT WAY IS NOT UH SOMETHING YOU CAN EXPECT
SO IT GIVES THE POSSIBILITY TO DECIDE TO GO UH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAT CAN BE MORE ON THIS UH LET'S SAY
THIS IS
HMM
MM-HMM HMM
WELL UH I THINK THE ADVANTAGE EVENTUALLY W I MEAN THE ADVANTAGE WITH THIS KIND OF THINGS IS THAT ARE MUCH EASIER
GAZE TRACKING IS STILL
JUST WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IS A DIFFICULT THING
I MEAN IT REQUIRES CAMERAS WITH PRETTY GOOD QUALITY ET CETERA
UH BUT I THINK HIS QUESTION IS MORE UH GENERAL
A AND IT SAYS SO I MEAN BASED ON THIS WORK DO YOU FIGURE OUT UH A DIRECTION IF THEY GUESS CORRECTLY
UH A DOMAIN A DIRECTION FOR YOUR THESIS FOR YOUR EXACTLY
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
ONE DOMAIN YEAH
NOT A COLLECTION OF LITTLE UH THINGS COMPLETELY UNRELATED
BUT UH
THAT'S VERY
MM-HMM
YEAH
M BUT STILL DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF SAYING WHAT I YEAH YEAH SURE SURE
WHAT I WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO FOR YOUR THESIS
I MEAN AS HERVE SAID I MEAN BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IN FOUR LINES
WHAT WILL BE THE TOPIC OF MY THESIS THE SUBJECT OF MY THESIS
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT JUST SAYING I'M GOING TO DO UH THIS THIS THIS AND THAT
I MEAN BECAUSE THIS WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
BUT YEAH IN A VERY BROAD SENSE I MEAN W WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE WHAT KIND OF UH
IF I INTERPRET CORRECTLY
THEN UH ONE BASIC THING I SUGGESTED EVEN THINKING ABOUT I MEAN IS EXACTLY THIS STRU ALL THESE SCENARIOS THAT CAN BE A MEETING
THAT CAN BE PRESENTATION WHERE YOU HAVE A S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPEECH BETWEEN THINGS THAT ARE SAID AND UH SOME TEXTUAL DOCUMENTS SOME WAY
WHY NOT TRY TO TO TO TO STUDY THIS RELATIONSHIP TO IMPROVE THIS RELATIONSHIP TO USE THIS RELATIONSHIP FOR UM MM WHATEVER IT IS
INDEXING OR ANNOTATION OR WHATEVER META DATA EXTRACTION
AND IF YOU WANT FOR EXAMPLE THIS LITTLE WORK UH ABOUT SEEING WHEN THE SLIDE CHANNEL IS BACKGROUND AND FOREGROUND IS NOT BEGINNING OF THIS KIND OF THING
SO A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO CHANNEL THAT PROVIDE SOME KIND OF INFORMATION
MM-HMM
SURE
SURE
SURE SURE SURE SURE
MM-HMM
NO NO BE CAREFUL
FOR THE RECOGNITION IN GENERAL THERE IS NO CORRELATION IN THE SENSE THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS ON THE SLIDE
MOST OF THE WORDS YOU USE MOST OF THE WORDS YOU USE ARE NOT REALLY CORRELATED TO THAT
ARE SIMPLY WORDS
AND CONSIDER ALSO THAT WE ALL SPEAK ENGLISH HERE
AND APART OF UH NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED VOCABULARY IN GENERAL
SO WE TEND TO USE ALWAYS THE SAME WORDS
BUT ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW LINGUISTIC RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ON AVERAGE THE PEOPLE USE FIVE HUNDRED WORDS
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE A DISPOSITION
AND WE SAY EVERYTHING UH YEAH
WE SAY EVERYTHING WITH THAT
AND PROBABLY WE NOT A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER WE USE EVEN LESS
SO THAT'S GIVES AN IDEA OF WHY BASICALLY IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS USE ANYWAY THE SAME WORDS
AND A FEW OCCURRENCES OF WORDS THAT ARE THERE IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION MAKE ONE TWO PERCENT
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY UH AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION
THEN YOU CAN CHANGE OF TASK AND USE A TASK THE TASK WE WERE MENTIONING ABOUT THE BACK CHANNEL OR FOREGROUND CHANNEL
IN THAT CASE THE ONLY WORDS THAT REALLY ARE IMPORTANT ARE THOSE WORDS THAT APPEAR ON BOTH SLIDES
AT THAT POINT I MEAN A LITTLE IMPROVEMENT OF THAT IT BECOMES A BIG IMPROVEMENT
I MEAN MAYBE IN TERMS OF RECOGNITION IT'S ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT
BUT IN TERMS OF THAT TASK IS MAYBE TWENTY PERCENT
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S ANOTHER INTERESTING POINT
I MEAN WE ARE USING DATA THAT ARE FAKE
ANY UH IN ANY CASE THEY ARE SIMULATION NO REAL DATA
AND ESPECIALLY THE SLIDES
I THINK I'VE SEEN THOSE SLIDES
I MEAN THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH ARTIFICIAL
EXACTLY
BUT BUT NOT PRE PREPARE
BUT
YEAH BUT
YEAH I YEAH I MEAN UH EVERYTHING IS PRETTY MUCH ARTIFICIAL
THAT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
SO YOU MENTION FOR EXAMPLE THIS UH FACT THAT SOMETIMES UH SPEAKERS TEND TO READ
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN YOU HAVE BULLET LIST HUH
SOMETIMES PEOPLE REALLY GO THROUGH
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE DATA SIMPLY BECAUSE UH UH IT WAS NOT THE SAME PEOPLE PREPA UH EXACTLY
AH
SO FOR EXAMPLE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE IN ANY CASE BECAUSE THE HERVE'S INFRASTRUCTURE IS READY AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO COLLECT THE PRESENTATION
THERE MAYBE WE CAN SEE
THE AUDIO IS IS IS VERY BAD
I I THING IS REALLY
YOU KNOW THAT WAS COLLECTED M A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS WITHOUT UH TOO MUCH CARE
IT WAS IT WAS UH A PERSONAL EFFORT OF MAEL THAT DECIDED TO DO IT
IT WAS REALLY GOOD TO DO IT
IT WAS VERY GOOD
BUT BASICALLY IT WAS MADE WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC KNOW WITHOUT THINKING WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE JUST TO HAVE THEM
SO THE ESPECIALLY THE AUDIO CHANNEL IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH THAT'S UH THAT'S THAT IS ONE OF THE REASON FOR EXAMPLE WHY WHICH UH MARK WE POINT PRETTY MUCH ON SLIDES AS A MEAN OF INDEXING
BECAUSE AT THAT POINT THERE IS NO INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMANS AND CAPTURE
BECAUSE WHENEVER YOU HAVE MICROPHONES THAT YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT'S IT'S IT BECOMES COMPLETE UH REALLY
YEAH
WE ARE BUILDING THIS SLOWLY
I MEAN IT'S IT'S UNFORTUNATE
I MEAN IS IS IS TAKING TIME FOR THE MATERIAL AND SO ON
BUT YEAH
THERE WILL BE THIS
UH IT WILL BE ONE CAMERA POINTING VERY GENERAL BUT JUST FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES ESSENTIALLY
ONE UH MICROPHONE
AND WE ARE THINKING TO USE UH LAPEL MICROPHONE YOU KNOW THIS THIS THING
AND SO THAT POTENTIALLY HELPFUL HOPEFULLY HELPFUL TO TO DO RECOGNITION
AND TO SLIDES THROUGH THE PROJECTOR
WO
LET'S SAY THAT UH IN ANY CASE UH W WELL THERE ARE TWO REASON
FIRST OF ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT CAN BE EASILY THE THE THE IDEA IS REALLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU TAKE YOU BRING SOMEWHERE ELSE AND IT WORKS
SO IT MUST BE AS EASY AS POSSIBLE
BUT IN ANY CASE I MEAN THE DEVICE WE ARE DOING HAS INPUT CHANNELS
SO SOME WAY YOU CAN ADD AS MANY INPUT AS WE WANT
SO WE ARE DEALING NOW WITH THREE
BUT THERE ARE OTHER INPUT UH LINES OPEN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
ALTHOUGH AT THAT POINT WE CAN USE THIS
I MEAN I WAS MENTION THE THE LAPEL MICROPHONE MM JUST LIKE THIS
BUT IF YOU TELL ME THIS THAT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE AT THIS POINT WE CAN USE THIS KIND OF THINGS
BUT I DON'T WHY WHY NOT UH SO THERE WILL BE OTHER DATA THEIR TEST DATA
UH AND ESPECIALLY FOR THIS KIND OF PROBLEM I THINK IT CAN BE A MUCH MORE USEFUL KIND OF DATA BECAUSE THERE IS REAL PRESENTATIONS
I MEAN IS IT'S REALITY
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S UH Y N IT IT IT IT'S EXACTLY
IT'S MORE REALISTIC AND UM YEAH PROBABLY IT CAN HELP GO IN THIS DIRECTION OF SAYING WELL LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPEN BETWEEN SPEECH AND SLIDES
UH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEP
OKAY THAT IS COOL
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S COOL
UH YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT'S A IT'S A EUROPEAN PROJECT ANYWAY
SO I GUESS UH IT MUST BE AVAILABLE SOMEWHERE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
M
YEAH MM-HMM
BUT ONLY WE'RE MEASURING ONE THIRD
IT'S NOT
AT LEAST IN NO I'M UH TALKING NOW ABOUT UM THE MEETING
HOW PRESENTATION OF COURSE
ON PRESENTATION IT IT SHOULD BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH OF COURSE
NO THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT IN MY OPINION UH WITH THE WORK THAT'S BEEN ALREADY DONE IS SOMETHING WE CAN GET PRETTY QUICKLY
IT'S AN INTERESTING TASK
IT'S MORE SPECIFIC ON UH MEETINGS
CERTAINLY NOT FOR UH FOR PRESENTATION
AND IT REPRESENT A NICE TASK THAT CAN BE MEASURED THAT IS CLEAR AND
MM YEAH
YEAH
UH I IN TERMS OF ACTUAL RECOGNITION CAN OF COURSE UH HELP
SO IT'S IT'S UH BUT OF COURSE NOT GOING TO BE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A KIND OF THESIS ABOUT THIS
NO THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
I MEAN
THAT UH IN A SENSE IF YOU WANT I MEAN THAT THAT'S AT LEAST THE WAY I SEE THE THAT LIST I HAVE MADE FOR MY OWN THESIS
I MEAN UH YOU DEFINE THAT DOMAIN I MEAN WHICH IS UH LARGE I MEAN WHICH CAN BE VERY GENERAL
SO INTERACTION BETWEEN UH SPEECH AND SLIDES COOL
AND THEN YOU SEE HOW ALL THESE THINGS THIS TWO LITTLE WORKS OR THE STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE
AND DETECTING WHEN IT IS UH ARE TWO LITTLE WORKS THAT SOME WAY FIT IN THAT VERY GENERAL UH FRAMEWORK
SHOWN FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW IT N THAT THINGS MM THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
FOR EXAMPLE ONE THAT I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO DO WHICH IS KIND OF FUN
SO WHEN YOU HAVE A BULLET LIST CAN I CLICK ON ONE OF THE BULLET AND GET THE PIECE OF SPEECH WHERE THE GUY WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT
BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST READ
SOMETIMES PEOPLE UH IM IMPROVE IS MORE UH SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHAT THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT FITS IN THAT KIND OF UH MM FRAMEWORK
AND THAT'S INTERESTING IN TERMS OF UH I MEAN FIRST OF ALL AGAIN IS MEASURABLE IN TERMS OF BROWSING
IN TERMS OF RETRIEVAL IN TERMS OF INDEXING ANNOTATION META DATA EXTRACTION
THAT CAN BE APPLIED IN MANY
THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW THAT UH THAT'S UH THAT'S SOMETHING UH YOU'RE MAYBE JOKING NOW
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN UH BE DONE FOR EXAMPLE
AND UH SOME WAY THERE ARE PARAMETERS THAT CAN BE MEASURED THAT TELL YOU THAT FOLLOWING CERTAIN UH CRITERIA UH THERE IS ONE VERY EASY FOR EXAMPLE
I HAD THE THE THE SP THERE ARE SPEAKER THAT NEVER LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE
THOSE ARE BAD SPEAKERS IN GENERAL
IT'S VERY WRONG
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE
THIS IS ONE
THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVENTUALLY CAN BE DONE
IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORDS ON YOUR SLIDES YOU NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO READ THEM
THE SPEAKERS THAT TAKE A TIME WHICH IS TOO CLOSE TO THAT THEY ARE NOT GOOD SPEAKER BECAUSE SOME WAY UH UM THEY'RE TALKING TOO FAST
THEY ARE NOT UH
YEAH THEY ARE NOT GIVING YOU THE TIME
AND THERE IS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CAN BE UH SOME WAY DETECTED AND MEASURED THAT TELL YOU WHETHER THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY RESPECTING SOME FORM OF UH UH
IT'S A BIT UH OF HAVING DIFFICULT AND UH I WOULD NOT UM GO THAT MUCH IN THAT DIRECTION
I MEAN IT'S UH BUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW UH
FIGURE YOU KNOW
TABLES NUMBER
AH VISUAL THINGS
WELL THAT'S FOR EXAMPLE WITH UH WE SUBMITTED A PROJECT WITH J JEAN MARC UM TO USE THAT THING AS META DATA
AND BASICALLY ONE THING FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND AND AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN FIT HUH
IT WILL BE NOT UH MAYBE
BUT BUT UH IF YOU GET THE PROJECT ET CETERA IN ANY CASE IT'S SOMETHING THAT JEAN MARC AND ME WE WANT TO DO
UH BASED ON THE KIND OF GRAPHIC OBJECT YOU HAVE SO TABLES QUESTIONS
UH FIGURES PLOTS ET CETERA THE SIDE ONE FOR EXAMPLE IT IS A RESULT
TRY TO GET SO THAT'S AGAIN IN TERMS OF STRUCTURING BROWSING STRUCTURE AND RETRIEVAL OKAY WHEN IT IS A RESULT
WHEN IT IS AN INTRODUCTION
WHEN IT IS UH
YEAH
YES YES YES YES YES YES
UH
UM
IT'S NOT REALLY TRUE
IT'S NOT REALLY IT'S NOT REALLY TRUE
YEAH YEAH IT'S NOT REALLY TRUE
YEAH THAT'S O IT'S ONE OF THE MOST FUNNY THING I MEAN YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOU WORK IN THIS THING
EACH ONE OF US HAS AN IDEA AND THEN IT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL
I MEAN S SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE STICK VERY CAREFULLY
IF THE P IF THEY PUT IN THE OUTLINE UH LET'S SAY TITLE ONE TITLE TWO THEN YOU'LL YOU FIND TITLE ONE TITLE TWO
BUT MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE ARE MUCH MORE GENERAL
SO MY OUTLINE IS SOMETHING LIKE INTRODUCTION AND EXPERIMENTS THE RESULTS CONCLUSIONS
YOU DON'T FIND THE SAME TITLE IN THE SLIDES
IT'S IT'S REALLY A DIFFERENT STYLE OF UH THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T PUT FOR EXAMPLE OUTLINE
WE WERE UH FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UM CORPUS OF M. L. M. E. SO THE ONE IS ON THE DEMO
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PRESENTATION HAVE NO OUTLINE
IN THE CORPUS OF THE TAM TWO THOUSAND FOUR TAM PRESENTATION TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PRESENTATION HAVE NO OUTLINE AT ALL
THAT'S THAT'S UH WHAT YEAH UH W IT IS
AND BASICALLY THAT'S THAT'S UH AND AGAIN THE OUTLINE IS TYPICAL MAYBE IN SCIENTIFIC PRESENTATION
WELL IN THAT CASE THAT MAJORITY HAS
OTHER KIND OF PRESENTATION PROBABLY NO
I MEAN IT'S IT'S AN HABIT WE HAVE
BUT UM YOU BUT AGAIN UH
I MEAN UNFORTUNATELY TH N THERE IS NOTHING TRUE
NOTHING TRUE IS IS EVERYTHING IS CHANCE PRETTY MUCH
SO UH THAT WAS ON
ON POSSIBLE WORK
MM-HMM
NOT MAYBE
FOR SURE
YEAH
MM-HMM
I SEE
I KNOW
YEAH YEAH
I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW
I SEE
AND SO ESSENTIALLY SAY WELL AS THERE IS THIS SILENCE TIME WHICH TEND TO BE EVEN MORE THAN THAN HOW IT IS
SO BETTER TO HAVE A KIND OF SILENCE DETECTION
SO SOMETHING THAT REALLY TAKES THIS AND THEY RECOGNIZE ONLY THAT UH THAT PART
THIS WILL IMPROVE THE PHONEME UH RECOGNITION RATE
THAT'S WHAT IT OF OF COURSE OF COURSE OF COURSE
AND AT THAT POINT EVEN THE UH CALL ROUTER THAT UH JEAN JEAN YVES HAS UH MADE CAN IMPROVE UH ITS PERFORMANCE
AND IT CAN BE USED AFTER UH TOOL FOR THE MEASURE WORK
UH
THAT WE GOT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SURE SURE
THEN OH YEAH YEAH YEAH
I KNOW
I KNOW THE PROBLEM
I SEE
I SEE
I SEE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I SEE
I SEE THE PROBLEM
I'M NOT NOT SURE IT'S
YEAH
I'M LOSI
NO
NO
MM-HMM
MM
NO NO
BASICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT AT UH AT A LEVEL THAT COULD BE ANYWAY
SO THE IDEA WAS GOOD
I THINK YEAH WITH A BETTER UH PHONEME RECOGNITION RATE DEFINITELY IT COULD UH IMPROVE ALSO THE THE CALL ROUTING PERFORMANCE
NOPE
BUT WE CAN WE CAN FIND
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
BUT WE CAN SOME WAY FIND A GUY
I MEAN THIS SHOULD SHOULD BE HAVE ALL DETAILS
SO IT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY TO AT LEAST THIS IS THE LAST NEWS I HAD AND THEN I CAN TRY TO GET HIM BACK
UH
YEAH
NO
GOING VERY PRA PRAGMATIC UH THERE IS A SUBMISSION UH DEADLINE FOR EXAMPLE THIRTY ONE DECEMBER FOR CONFERENCE ON MULTI MEDIA AND EXPO WHERE I THINK THESE TWO LITTLE WORKS ON
SO IT CAN BE
IT'S AS A PROPOSAL
BECAUSE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THIS WORK ON THE PHONEME ANYWAY STILL TAKES SOME DEVELOPMENT TIME IN THE SENSE THAT UH NO
OKAY
I SEE
MM-HMM
AND
YEAH
ANYWAY THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE ARE RESULTS
YOU ARE YOU HAVE JUST TO TO DECIDE UH YEAH WHAT WHAT WHAT UH WHAT YOU WANT TO WORK FIRST AND AND AND FINALISE
I THINK YOU CAN REALLY START FINALISING MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S OKAY
SO THE TAPE IS TA TAPE IS AT THE END
YEAH SORRY ABOUT THAT MATTHEW IS STILL ON THE WAY
OKAY HANG ON REPLY COMING
YEAH IT'S OKAY
U OH I HATE THESE THINGS
VOILA
OKAY
SO
UM WE CAN MAYBE GET A HEAD START
UM HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO MATTHEW ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING
OR
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WHICH WAS THE INTUITIVE FEELING
YEAH
YEAH
AND IS AND THE R RESULT WAS NO
BUT UH BU BUT THE QUESTION IS IF IS THAT RESULT NO BECAUSE IT'S NO OR IS IT ALSO JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NOT REALLY ENOUGH DATA TO BE SURE ABOUT ANYTHING
SURE
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S NOT GONNA YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THIS IS SO SORT OF A FEELING THAT WE HAD BUT HADN'T SHOWN
I THINK I MEAN I IN UH FROM UH FROM AN APPLICATION POINT OF VIEW IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VOCABULARY CONTAINS ALL THE WORDS ON THE SLIDES
BUT FROM A RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE IT'S NOT INTERESTING
THERE'D BE VERY FEW
WELL THIS IS H THIS IS HOW THE DICTIONARY'S CALCULATED
IT CALCULATED SUCH THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE WORD IT DOESN'T AFFECT TO A GREAT DEGREE THE THE THE WORD ERROR RATE
SO
YEAH
SURE
YEP
M LIKE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT TH YEAH
NO
WELL THIS IS YEAH
THAT'S YEAH
YEAH
OH SORRY ABOUT THAT
YEAH
OF COURSE
YEAH YEAH
YEP
'CAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
YEP
YEP
HMM
YEAH
HMM
I MEAN THE IT'S PROBABLY VERY DEPENDENT ON THE SPEAKER AS WELL
SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HABIT OF JUST READING WHAT THEY'VE GOT ON THEIR SLIDES AND SOME PEOPLE ARE COM ARE ARE WELL
OR OR OR QUITE PURPOSEFULLY TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS SO THAT THEY'VE SORT OF GOT MULTI MODALITY OF YOU KNOW
BUT SO I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S NOT A SURPRISING RESULT THEN
THE UM
YEAH
YEAH
S
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SURE
WE S GO STRAIGHT TO THE SEMANTICS OF THE YEP
HMM
YES
MAYBE
OKAY
OH OKAY
WELL I MEAN UH IT JUST COMES DOWN TO THE TO THE MERE FACT THAT WORD ERROR RATE IS JUST TAKE THE WORDS
HOW MANY OF THEM DID YOU GET RIGHT
TAKE PLUS OR MINUS TWO OR THREE OR FIVE OR TEN WORDS DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
SO YEAH
EVEN IF THOSE WORDS AT THE END OF THE DAY WOULD BE QUITE IMPORTANT IN ANY SORT OF SEARCH OF THE TRANSCRIPT
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST USE THE SLIDES TO SEARCH THE TRANSCRIPT
I IF YOU HAVE TH SLIDES THEN YEAH
NO
Y YOU'D JU I MEAN THE UH I MEAN IT SO I MEAN HAVE YOU BEEN DOING OTHER THINGS THEN
HAVE YOU HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TO DO IN IN IN PLACE OF THIS
OR OR OR LEADING ON FROM THIS GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE LEARNT
'CAUSE OURS IS STRICT
YEAH
YEAH
ASSOCIATED
YEAH
SURE
THE FOCUS
YEAH OKAY
YEP
OKAY
M MEETING ACTION SORT OF FOCUS
YEP
HMM
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEAH SURE
YEAH
W
WELL
YEAH
YE YEAH OKAY
SO I MEAN UH YOU COULD BEGIN WITH S SAYING THE A UM THE SIMPLE TASK OF JUST DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THE SPEECH IS RELATED TO THE SLIDE CONTENT
AND WHICH IS SORT OF BUILDING UPON WHAT YOU KNOW DONG AND OTHERS HAVE WORKED ON IN TERMS OF
YOU KNOW IS IT DISCUSSION MONOLOGUE FROM THE ORIGINAL M. FOUR DATA COLLECTION
UH A Y ARE ARE YOU ALSO CONSIDERING THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEETINGS FOR INSTANCE
UM WELL OKAY
WELL I MEAN IT IF IF IF THESE SIMILAR SORT OF PHRASES OR WORDS WERE DISCUSSED IN THIS MEETING AND WERE ALSO DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING
THEN YOU SORT OF HAVE A A LINK BETWEEN MEETINGS FOR INSTANCE
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS YOU HAVE TO CHES THE CHECK THE STATISTICS
BUT I I MEAN 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOTTA THINK TOWARDS WHAT YOU KNOW
THIS THIS WON'T OCCUPY AB AB YOU KNOW WON'T OCCUPY YOU FOR THREE YEARS OR WHATEVER JUST ON THIS I GUESS
BUT HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE FUTURE AND SO JUST A S
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
AND YEP
YEP
YEAH
WELL Y YEAH
SURE
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN UH IT'S IT'S AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA COLLECTED OR ANNOTATED YET IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW ISN'T IT
YEAH
YEP YEP YEP
HMM
YEAH SURE
OR B OR AS YOU SAY BACK CHANNEL VERSUS YEAH
'CAUSE I TH THINK THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING
I MEAN 'CAUSE IT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF SPEECH ACTIVITY WHICH IS YEAH
SURE
OKAY
OKAY
SO I MEAN AS FAR AS THAT YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING TO DO THAT I PRESUME
UM YOU DON'T NEED ANY EXTRA STUFF FROM US IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
OR I MEAN THAT'S GOOD
THAT'S GOOD
BUT I MEAN IT IT
UH YEAH I WOULDN'T GET TOO DISTRACTED I GUESS ON D D IF YOU'VE GOT TWO TRACKS I'D LIKE TO
YEAH
UM
YEAH
HMM
BUT I
AND UH THE K AND THE QUESTION IS ALSO ARE THERE OTHER SORT OF MORE SENSIBLE WAYS OF DOING IT
FOR INSTANCE UM GAZE TRACKING
I MEAN IF IF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE SLIDES
YEAH SURE
AND IT HAS SPECIFIC TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
UH BUT I MEAN FOR INSTANCE IT SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE OTHER STUFF THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING ON UM CALL ROUTING FOR INSTANCE
AND AND UM YOU KNOW UH ERROR MERIT ERR ERROR MEASURES YES
I MEAN I THINK I MEAN I I THINK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO DRAW SOME SORT OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO AS WE WERE SAYING
I MEAN MAYBE IF YOU YOU DON'T MEASURE THINGS IN TERMS OF WORD ERROR RATE MAYBE THIS SORT OF INFORMATION DOES ACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING
GIVEN THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WORDS ARE NOT ACTUALLY INTERESTING
UM SO I MEAN
W
WELL W UH W NO IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT IT'S F WHAT IS IT
YEAH
HMM
SURE
MM
YEAH
I THINK I THINK IT'S MAYBE AN INTERESTING TEST SCENARIO AND WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE SORT OF BASING SOMETHING AROUND SPEECH AND AND TEXT
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE ONE SORT OF EXTRA HIGHER GOAL ABOVE THAT SO THAT YOU CAN MOTIVATE FUTURE RESEARCH
HMM
YEAH
YEAH THIS WAS
YEAH
FOR ENGLISH IT'S ESPECIALLY LOW
YEAH
YEAH
SPECI
YEAH
YEAH
WELL ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THESE MODELS HAVE BEEN TUNED TO INCLUDE AMI DATA
SO I MEAN PERHAPS IF YOU HAD SLIDES AND AND PRESENTATIONS TO DO WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS OFF TOPIC
YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOU HADN'T SEEN ANY PRIOR DATA THEN YOU MIGHT SEE A BIGGER CONTRIBUTION AS WELL
BUT I MEAN ESSENTIALLY YOU'VE ACTUALLY SORT OF INCLUDED THE INFORMATION FROM THE SLIDES IN THE LANGUAGE MODEL
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY THEY'RE PRE PRE PREPARED
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
IT'S NOT THERE
OKAY
Y THE AUDIO QUALITY THOUGH
YEAH
YEAH
WAS GOOD TO YEAH
YEAH
AH
YEAH THEY HAD LIKE UH Y UH Y THEY YOU KNOW THEY HAD THIS SET UP WITH THE UH THE MICROPHONES
SO SOMEONE EVERY IT THERE WAS ONE MICROPHONE SHARED BETWEEN EVERY TWO PEOPLE
BUT THEY HAD DEALS WITH PEOPLE FORGETTING TO TURN THE MICROPHONE ON FORGETTING TO TURN IT OFF
UH F IT WAS IT WAS MEANT I THINK THEY THEY CHOSE THAT LECTURE THEATRE POSSIBLY WITH THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR COLLECTING DATA
I MEAN I UH I'M SURE THEY COULD HAVE PROBABLY HAD UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH HOST IT OR WHATEVER
BUT I TH I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE H. C. I. PART OF IT DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT TO HOW THEY PLANNED
SO AP
YEAH
UM IT IS I MEAN IT'S SAME AS US PUTTING ON A THE HEADPHONES AND WHATEVER
I MEAN EVEN THAT MINOR THING
I MEAN ANY ANY AUDIO CAPTURED DURING THAT PERIOD IS I IS RUBBISH
BUT THERE'S NO SORT OF SYSTEM THAT'S REALLY BUILT TO D TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE CAPTURING THAT
OKAY
THE
UH WHAT WILL THAT INCORPORATE
WILL IT INCORPORATE LIKE UH AN S. M. A. AND UH
YEP
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO NO NO UH MICROPHONE ARRAYS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
I GUESS THAT'S QUITE A THAT'S A QUITE A BI BIG DEAL FOR SETTING UP THE RECORDINGS I GUESS
YEAH
YEP
AS YOU WANT YEP
OKAY
YEAH BUT LET'S PRETEND THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN ANY FORESEEABLE FUTURE
WH UH THE I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING FROM PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVES
YOU'D YOU'D HAVE TO THE THE AMI RECOGNITION SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW IS EITHER FOR THESE MICROPHONES OR FOR THE MICROPHONE ARRAY
THERE'S NO LAPEL SYSTEM TRAINED FOR INSTANCE
SO I MEAN THAT IN ITSELF IT WOULD I MEAN YOU'D HAVE SOME FUN TRAINING SOME MORE SPEECH RECOGNITION MODELS
BUT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S
SURE
YEAH
IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE USING FOR THIS TYPE OF TASK
I THINK
YEAH
AND EVERY TIME WE D WE GENERATE A NEW CORPUS AND TRY TO CARRY OUT NEW RESEARCH WE DISCOVER SORT OF AREAS THAT ARE TOO CONTROLLED YOU KNOW
I MEAN THE AMI ONES WERE A LOT BETTER IN TERM OF THAT THAN M. FOUR OR WHATEVER
BUT STILL
I MEAN ES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET INTO HIGHER LEVEL SORT OF UH INTERPRETATION IT'S YEAH
OH WELL
I'M UH I'M JUST CURIOUS DO THE LIKE THE ICSI MEETINGS DO THEY HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE AUDIO
DO THEY HAVE SLIDES OR ANYTHING ALONG THAT I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD
OKAY I'M JUST THINKING WHETHER OR NOT THERE AN ARE ANY OTHER SOURCES I MEAN MAYBE CHIL DATA
'CAUSE IT'S I THINK IT'S GONNA BE MORE LIKE THE TAM TYPE SITUATION
SO
MM-HMM
I DON'T KNOW
BUT I MEAN GIVEN THAT IT'S COMING FROM THE SAME BASIS AS AMI
I I EXPECT THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF RELATIVELY F LIBERAL SORT OF DISTRIBUTION POLICY
YEAH
YEAH
THE ONE THING ABOUT THAT AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP IN THE LAST NIST EVALS WAS THE FACT THAT IT'S ALMOST TOO UNI MODAL
YOU'VE JUST GOT ONE LECTURER TALKING
SO ONCE AGAIN YOU DON'T SEE THE THE COMPLEX SORT OF LEVELS OF INTERACTION
I MEAN UH Y UH THERE'S NO WAY OF GETTING AROUND THAT
I MEAN YOU JUST HAVE TO THINK OF A A TASK A CHALLENGE THAT IS RELEVANT TO THAT TYPE OF RECORDING
WHICH MIGHT MM YOU MIGHT USE THE SAME METHODS AS WHAT WE'VE BEEN PR TALKING ABOUT TODAY
BUT THE ACTUAL SORT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MEASURE MIGHT NEED TO BE SLIGHTLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT I GUESS
I DON'T YEAH YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF SAY MEASURING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SLIDES OR OFF CHANNEL
I MEAN YOU MIGHT FIND NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF YOUR DATA IS DIRECTLY REFERRING TO YOUR SLIDES IN A T IN A TAM
THAT IS UH IS IN TAMS
YEAH BUT I'M I'M MEANING IF YOU MOVE ON TO THESE CORPORA YEAH
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE BASICALLY YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
AND UH AND AT THE S AND AT THE SAME END OF THE DAY
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE USING OR LEARNING ABOUT THE SAME TECHNIQUES THAT YOU'LL NEED FOR DOING OTHER THINGS ALONG THESE LINES
SO
OKAY
IT WELL IT'S IT'S TO MAKE A PROPOSAL BASICALLY FOR YOUR YEP UH
THIS N
OKAY
YEP
THE SP
MM-HMM
YEAH
SURE
SOMETIMES IT'S A LOT MORE
YEAH
YEAH
MM YEAH
YEAH
WELL YOU'D UH SURE
AT L AT AT LEAST SPOT IF THEY FORGET TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING AND IT WON'T LET THEM CONTINUE ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE UNTIL THEY'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE POINTS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL UH THAT THAT WAS JUST THROUGH SHEER WEIGHT OF CONTENT THOUGH
W
B YEAH
AS IN FIVE SIX YOU KNOW NUMBER WHERE WHERE THE GRAPHEMIC YEAH WELL I YEAH
YEAH
ALTHOUGH I REMEMBER DISCUSSING THIS LIKE UM 'CAUSE UH WHEN NEVILLE WAS WORKING ON HIS HIS STUFF WHICH WAS JUST BASED ON THE SLIDES
IF UM HE HE ASKED ME ALL YOU KNOW COULD I PRE SEGMENT THE SLIDES FOR HIM UH
YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO S YOU WANTED TO HAVE THE TOPIC SEGMENTATION
AND I SAID WELL JUST LOOK AT THE THE HEADINGS
BECAUSE ANYBODY GENERALLY WHO WRITES THE SLIDES YEAH
IT'S NOT OKAY
IT'S TRUE FOR ME THEN
OKAY
YEP
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
UH IT YEAH IT DEPENDS YEAH
THAT'S A STYLISTIC THING AS MUCH AS ANYTHING
YEP
YEAH
HMM
MM
YEAH
WHICH UH WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A GOOD OR A BAD THING
IT DEPENDS ON THE TALK
YEAH PRESENTATION YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SOMETHING WE'RE TAUGHT AT UNIVERSITY FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE
THE STRUCTURE
YEAH YEAH SURE
IT'S ALL SUBJECTIVE
HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
IT'S QUITE STRICTLY IMPOSED NOW
YE
YEAH
AFTER THE AFTER THE HARD DRIVE CRASH WE TOOK THE TIME TO ACTUALLY REBUILD THE THE THE SYSTEM AND ACTUALLY TRAIN 'CAUSE ORIGINALLY WE SORT OF HAD THE IDEA OF OH WE'LL USE A RECOGNIZER THAT'S BEEN TRAINED ON A LARGE AMOUNT OF TELEPHONE SPEECH DATA AND THAT SHOULD GIVE US A BETTER RESULT
I JUST AS A CONTRAST I TRAINED ONE SPECIFICALLY ON THIS DATA
RESULTS WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL UM WHICH SAYS TO ME THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DATA RATHER THAN AND IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS
IT'S SIMPLY THAT IT HASN'T BEEN UM CHUNKED IT OR OR SEGMENTED IN A WAY THAT'S TYPICAL OF SPEECH RESOURCES
IN TERMS OF UM YOU CAN HAVE LIKE UH A TWO SECOND UTTERANCE UH CREDIT CARDS AND THEN TWENTY SECONDS OF SILENCE COMING AFTER IT
WHICH IN WHICH WHEN YOU F WHEN YOU FIRST THINK ABOUT IT YOU JUST THINK OH SILENCE WHATEVER NOTHING WILL HAPPEN
BUT A LOT OF THE NORMALIZATION THAT WE USE
UH YEAH C. M. S. C. C. V. N.
UH SO W WE NEED A DECENT END POINT DETECTION SYSTEM RUNNING BEFORE WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN DO THAT
AND WE'RE CONVERGING ON HAVING ONE NOW JUST IN IN SORT OF TANDEM WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT OF THIS WEB BASED RECOGNIZER
UM BUT OF COURSE UNFORTUNATELY ALL THESE THINGS TAKE TIME
UM BUT I I THINK WE SHOULD SEE A DECENT SORT OF IMPROVEMENT THEN
NOT JUST IN TERMS OF NO LONGER HAVING RECOGNITION ERRORS WHENEVER SILENCE APPEARS
'CAUSE YOU GET THAT IMMEDIATE BENEFIT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INSERTION ERRORS
BUT ALSO IT SHOULD ACTUALLY AFFECT THE RECOGNITION ON THE SPEECH SEGMENTS AS WELL
TH
THE
YEAH
YEAH
MM THAT'S THE HARD P OH I MIGHT UH GIVEN THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD WITH THIS CORPUS I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES
THAT'S THE INTENTION YEP
SURE SURE
WE TRAINED THE SYSTEM JUST ON THIS DATA
LIKE THERE WERE THERE WERE SIX THOUSAND UTTERANCES THAT WEREN'T USED FOR UH THE CALL ROUTING SIDE OF THINGS
I THINK THEY TH THERE WERE THIRTEEN THOUSAND IN THE ENTIRE CORPUS
SIX T HALF OF THEM ROUGHLY WE'VE THROWN AWAY
SO USE THAT FOR ACOUSTIC TRAINING
AND THE RESULTS FROM THAT WERE ALMOST THE SAME AS WHAT WE GOT FOR THE C. T. S. MODEL
Y YEAH
BUT ONE CAN IMAGINE A COMMERCIAL SYSTEM UH THAT THAT THAT S STEVEN COX USED FROM NUANCE PROBABLY HAD ALL THESE THINGS
BUILT IN END POINT DETECTION ET CETERA ET CETERA
SO
MM
YEAH
YEAH
AND THERE'S ALSO JUST THINGS LIKE TELE UH RECEIVER NOISE AT THE BEGINNING AND OR AT THE END OF THE AND I MEAN THESE THESE ARE THINGS YOU CAN GET RID OF IF IT'S A
MM
YEP
MM OKAY THIS IS F OKAY
OKAY
WE CAN JUST RUN SOME GENERIC YEAH
WELL I DON'T MIND RUNNING IT
I'VE GOT ALL THE SCRIPTS SET UP
SO
WELL I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE I SEE THE POINT ACTUALLY
UH
MM
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW THING TH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT A
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S A
WE MIGHT AS WELL
'CAUSE I MEAN WE'VE UP UNTIL NOW UH YOU HAVEN'T BEEN RUNNING ANY RECOGNITION ON AND NEITHER DID JEAN YVES ON THAT ON THAT DATA
YEAH
YEAH
OH SURE BUT I MEAN THE SCRIPTS ARE SO AUTOMATED IT'S JUST A MATTER OF SITTING UH UH SUBMITTING A JOB TO THE CLUSTER AND
I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF THAT
I DON'T MIND RUNNING IT
THAT'D IT'D BE LIKE UH HALF AN HOUR'S WORK IN A DAY TO RUN THE RECOGNITION SCRIPTS
I MEAN I I I I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING
ARTEM SHOULD FAMILIARISE HIMSELF WITH THE A. S. R. SYSTEMS OR WHATEVER
FINE
BUT I DON'T UH I D I DON'T THINK THIS IS A POINT THAT'S WORTH SORT OF WORRYING ABOUT AT THIS STAGE ANYWAY
I MEAN
WELL 'CAUSE I'M I'M SORT OF ASSUMING THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SO AN END POINT DETECTION REGARDLESS OF THIS WORKING ON THIS NUANCE CORPUS
SO
WE NEED IT FOR AMI
WE NEED IT FOR UM THE ONLINE DEMO
FOR UH ALL THESE THINGS YEAH
IT'S IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WOULD THINK
WELL IT'S SPEECH AND ANY AND ANY OTHER CLASS OF SOUND
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
IT'S
AND IS
AND ANY OTHER CLASS YEAH
IF IT WAS JUST SILENCE IT'D BE EASY
BUT UH UM AND IN CONTROLLED PLACES YOU CAN'T JUST ASSUME IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW ANY ENERGY BELOW A CERTAIN THRESHOLD
AND THIS IS WHAT EVERYBODY SORT OF CLAIMED THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED WITH YEARS AGO
BUT
WELL I MEAN THIS IS ONCE AGAIN A
YEAH SURE
BUT I MEAN THIS IS ONCE AGAIN A VERY CONSTRAINED TASK AGAIN
I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S YOU YOU'RE ALMOST ASSURED IT'S ONLY GONNA BE A SINGLE SPEAKER ON THE MICROPHONE
SO I MEAN THE THE ONLY SORTS OF NOISE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH UH IS IS IS HISS OR IMPULSIVE I WOULD SAY
OR OR THAT WOULD BE A GOOD START
NO NO
YEAH
YEAH
IT WAS SHOWING THAT
UM YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM I TAKE IT EITHER
NO
OKAY
WELL IT'D BE NICE TO GET THE THESIS I THINK
THERE'S A SORT OF JUST A RESEARCH REPORT SORT OF BASIS FOR THIS
YEAH
BUT
OKAY
YEAH
APPLY SOME PRESSURE
UH N NO IT SHOULD BE LOOKING TOWARDS THE START OF NEXT YEAR BASICALLY
THE IS IT SO I MEAN YOU SHOULD
OKAY WHICH IS
YEAH
AND IT'S NICE TO GET SOME FEEDBACK ON I MEAN THAT FEEDBACK WILL PROBABLY COME AFTER YOUR PROPOSAL POSSIBLY
BUT UM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
EXACTLY
N YEAH SORT OUT ANY BUGS OR WHATEVER
YEAH
YEAH
I I I'D PREFER TO GO BACK TO THE C. T. S. MODELS I THINK AS WELL 'CAUSE I THINK I THINK THEY DID WORK A LITTLE BIT BETTER
SO YEAH
YEP
HAYES IS ANOTHER ONE ISN'T IT
OH OKAY SORRY
I WAS LIKE 'CAUSE I SAW YOU SLI I SAW YOU LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH BEFORE AND I LIKE WOW
GONNA HAVE TO S HAVE THIS AMI CORPUS LINKED IN NO TIME
OH OKAY
UH NOT NORMALLY YEAH
IT COULD GO TO THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT
YEAH
YEAH WE'VE BEEN TOLD
OKAY
FINE
YEAH
COULD YOU JU JUST QUICKLY REWIND
YEAH
OKAY
OH
OKAY
OKAY
OH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO NO
WAIT WAIT
IT'S GOING VERY FAST FOR ME ACTUALLY
THING ACTUALLY
IT'S VERY FAST
SO WHA FIRST POINT THE FIRST THING YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU TOOK THE SLIDES AND YOU WAS AND YOU HAD A L BIG DICTIONARY AND YOU ARE SEEING UH WHAT WHAT ARE THE INSIDE THE SLIDE
RIGHT
UH WHAT THE 'CAUSE I FIRST STATEMENT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
UH WHEN YOU SAID THE THE ST UH UH THE S UH THE W YEAH
SO WE WHAT'S SO YEAH SO COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME LITTLE BIT MORE IN DETAIL
YEAH
NO NO NO DON'T GO THAT
I I WANT THE NO
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THE WO UH THE TE UH THING LIKE SAYING THAT I TOOK A DICTIONARY AND THEN A WORD FROM THE SLIDE AND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND CLEARLY CLEARLY THAT
MM MM-HMM
OKAY BUT DO HOW DO WHY DO YOU WANT CERTAIN WORDS
LIKE WHA HOW DO YOU EXPECT THAT CERTAIN WORDS
YEAH
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
IT APPEARS IN ALMOST UH UH IT IS IF IT APPEARS IN ALL THE SLIDES IT SAYS A HUNDRED PERCENT CORRELATION FOR ME
ONE PERCENT WELL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ARE LIKE THAT
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY IT'S INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER
OKAY
OKAY FINE THAT'S FINE THAT'S UH UH UH S CERTAIN WORDS IT SHOULD
YOU HAVE TO
OKAY
FINE
NOW I'M UH OKAY
I'M INTO THE LOOP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
CONTEXT
BUT IT IS IMPLEMENTED ON THE A. S. R.
OR UH WHERE
OKAY
OKAY
OH OKAY
YEAH
ELSE INTERPOLATE EXTRAPOLATE
YEAH
YEAH
UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU MEA SO UH YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT UM LIKE WHEN ONE CASE YOU WERE SAYING THAT IF YOU INCLUDE THE CONTEXT AND ALL THOSE THING IT HELPS IN YOUR A. S. R. IMPROVEMENT
BUT IT DOESN'T WHICH MORE SUBJECTIVE I THINK THIS WHOLE
YEAH
UH-HUH
YES
YEAH
MM
MM YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT YEAH
OR IT COULD
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO YOU SO YOU SO OKAY
SO MAYBE LIKE IT CAN BE UH SOMETHING LIKE IN A MEETING IT CAN BE LIKE AN UNUSUAL SCENARIO FOR YOU IN A PRESENTATION WITH A SLIDE
AND THE UNUSUAL SCENARIO THAT YOU'RE NOT USING THE UH SLIDE AT ALL
MM-HMM
YEAH
WHAT ARE THE OTHER SLIDE YEAH
WE HAVE PLENTY OF THINGS TO DO
WHAT TRACK
YEAH
GO ON
YEAH IT'S NO PROBLEM
OKAY
SO UH WELL SO ULTIMATELY NOW THE NEXT STEP WHAT IS THAT
BECAUSE I WANT LIKE KIND OF A UH SO AT FIRST YOU SAID THAT OKAY NOW YOU DID THIS
THIS CORRELATION STUDIES
AND THEY SHOW THAT THERE'S A VERY LESS CORRELATION OR IN FACT NO CORRELATION KIND OF THING
AND UH UM UH SO UH SO WHAT NEXT IN ON TOP OF IT WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD I MEAN IS THE QUESTION NOW
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH SO T I MEAN TO THE DIFFERENT DIRECTION NOW THAT'S WHAT I MEAN TO SAY
WHAT YOU LIKE TO TAKE FROM THERE
UH IT'S NOT DEFINED YET OKAY
MM-HMM
BUT WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM
WE NEED A DEFINITION OF SOME KIND OF UH PROBLEM RIGHT
UH YEAH
YEAH
NO NO NO
NO BUT
YEAH DIRECTION
YEAH THAT'S THAT IS A THING
WE GO ON TO THE NEXT DIRECTION
IT SHOULD NOT THAT I IT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN THAT YOU'RE DOING SO MANY THINGS AND ULTIMATELY IT DOESN'T GOES INTO A THESIS
THE THAT'S THAT SHOULD NOT THE PROBLEM
YOUR THESIS SHOULD BE W IN ONE DIRECTION
ONE PROBLEM
AND UH SHOULD GO UH IN ONE OR UH ONE D YEAH
IT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
UH THE IT MAY BE GOOD AS A C. V. FOR YOU BUT THEN AS A THESIS YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS UH DEFENDING IT AND ALL THOSE THINGS
SO WHAT IS THAT UH WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT POSSIBLE DIRECTION YOU WANT TO TAKE
UH
ERROR MEASURE
IT'S YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
MM
S SEE THAT IS GOING TO TELL US UH SOMETHING LIKE UH WHA THE THING IS THAT I UH IT IT SEE YOU CAN TOTALLY GO INTO THE TEXT DOMAIN AND BE THERE
YOU KNOW
IT CAN BE S NO PROBLEM
BUT AS LONG AS UH IT IS OKAY
BUT IF YOU WANT TO DO WITH UH S LIKE CERTAIN SOMETHING WITH THE SPEED AND ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER THEN IT'S A DIFFERENT SCENARIO
UH YOU MAY NOT WANT TO WORK ON ALL THE PROBLEMS
SOMEONE MAY WORK ON SOME OTHER PROBLEM
BUT THEN YOU YOU MAKE USE OF THAT TO EXTEND YOUR WORK IN SOME
AND UH AND AS I ALSO T IT DEPENDS LIKE ALSO LIKE I THINK IF UH BOSS IS INTERESTED IN WORKING IN BOTH SPEECH AND TEXT
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND VERY WELL
THAT PART IS ALSO THERE
NO THE BOSS
LIKE HAVE A IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF SAYING LIKE YOU SHOULD LIKE WORK ON BOTH SIDE YOU KNOW THE TEXT AND THE SPEECH ASPECT OF IT
SO YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH W ONE THING INTERESTING IS WHAT WE CAME UP IN THE DISCUSSION ALSO YOU ABOUT TELLING THAT UH DETECTING SUCH SCENARIOS WHERE THERE IS NO RELATION BETWEEN THE SLIDE AND THE PERSON TALKING
THAT MAY BE ONE GOOD STARTING POINT FOR YOU ACTUALLY
AND THEN AT THAT POINT Y UH YOU DETECT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU SHOW SOMETHING LIKE UH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT I IF THERE IS UH IF UH THERE I IF IT IS OUT OF DISCUSSION
THE WORDS ARE NO WAY ARE GOING TO HELP YOUR RECOGNITION ANYWAY A. S. R.
BUT IF IT IS MORE ON THE UM THE SLIDE INFORMATION IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU
BUT UH IF IT IS UH IF IT IS RELATED TO THE SLI WHAT HE IS GIVING A PRESENTATION ON THE SLIDE THEN YOU SHOW THE YOUR A. S. R. IF YOU DETECT THIS EVEN THEN YOU CAN SHOW THAT HOW WHERE YOU CAN REALLY HELP OR NOT HELP
BECAUSE YOU SAY THERE'S NO CORRELATION NOW
BUT THEN HERE IT COMES THAT THERE AT SOME POINT THERE MIGHT BE A CORRELATION THERE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
SO OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
OH
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THE TH SIDES AND THE TALK
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
LIKE ANOTHER MIC
TH YEAH MOST OF THE MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE THE TITLE TO DO NO
THE AMI DAT THE AMI DATA WHAT THAT LIKE THAT ONLY MOST OF THE TIME YOU KNEW THEY HAD THE WORD
THE WORD YOU ARE GOING TO PRESENT
EVERYONE IS PRESENTING THE SAME SET OF SLIDE
YEAH
WHAT ABOUT M. L. M. I.
W THE ONE WE COLLECTED LAST YEAR
AUDIO IS VERY BAD RIGHT
YEAH
UH ONE SINGLE CHANNEL OR AT LEAST A CLOSED CHANNEL COLLECTION NO
OKAY OKAY OKAY
IT WAS GOOD
THA THA THA THAT
UH OKAY
SO THEY ARE IS THERE ARE STILL USING THAT UH DESKTOP MICROPHONE OR WHAT OVER THERE
OR
UH
AH
OKAY
OKAY
THAT'S FINE YEAH
YEAH
IT'S A
YEAH IT'S A
YEAH I UNDERSTAND
OKAY SO NOW THERE BE UH WOULD BE SOME TIME WH WHAT IS WE SHOULD BE GETTING A TIME RECORDING SYSTEM RIGHT
THAT UH UH UH SO
MM
OKAY
LAPEL
SHOULD BE OKAY
NO IT IT'S IT'S UH QUITE A BIT YEAH PROBLEM TO DO THAT KIND OF THING
YEAH
MM
YEAH BUT PROBABLY WE WERE THE F YOU KNOW THE POST UH THE THE THING IS SOMEWHERE PROJECTOR
SUPPOSE THERE'S LIKE THE THE WHITE BOARD OR WHATEVER THE PRESENTATION IS OVER THERE THE SPEAKER IS MORE PROBABLY IS GOING TO THIS WAY OR THAT WAY
SO PROBABLY YOU YOU MAY NOT NEED A VERY BIG MICROPHONE EITHER
PROBABLY ONE OR TWO
UH UH YE UH YEAH
UH YEAH
HMM
YEAH
NO THE THEY THE THE THE
CHIL MAY BE INTERESTING FOR YOU
BUT IT'S A L UH WELL YEAH IT MAY BE INTERESTING FOR YOUR PROBLEM I THINK
Y YEAH
NO NO NO
YEAH
YEAH IT'S MORE LIKE TAM
BUT UH YEAH
THE THE THEIR COLLECTION IS MUCH UH UH LIKE THEY HAVE UH R. T. N. S AND ALL THOSE THING
PEOPLE SITTING AND UH IT'S A LEC IT'S A LECTURE UH A MEETING COLLECTION
AND I UH IS IT THROUGH N N UH L. D. A. OR SOMETHING
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO SO PROBABLY WE CAN YEAH
CHIL MAY BE INTERESTING ACTUALLY
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT
IN THE TEXT
MM
WELL BUT UH
S
YEP
HMM
MM-HMM
THAT'S THAT'S A YEAH
THAT THAT THEY HAVE
MM
THEY'RE TALKING FAST
I HAD A PROBLEM I LIKE FIND THE ANSWER FOR MY OWN
YEAH
SO WHAT ABOUT THE FIGURE THINGS
WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S A FIGURES COMING ON THE SLIDE
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH THAT
ON THE S UH-HUH
EITHER STOP IT
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
USUALLY IN PRODUCTS AND RESOURCES
OKAY SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO BETWEEN THE DATA WHEN YOU COLLECT AND THIS
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW
BY THE TIME YOU GET THE DATA IT'S GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER TWO MONTHS IF I AM RIGHT THE WHOLE CAPTURING SYSTEM WHEN IT IS GOING TO COME
SO WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP
YEAH YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT IT IN LIKE TWO MONTHS ALSO AGAIN
YEAH YEAH TO SUBMIT YEAH
IT'S ONE YEAR RIGHT
FOR SURE
YOU YOU NEED IT BAD
CALL ROUTING WHERE
THAT'S INTE
I THINK WE SHOULD YEAH
THIS IS YEAH
UH H OH
YEAH
MM YEAH
MM YEAH
UH UH
UH YEAH
YEAH
EVEN IF LITTLE BIT OF
OH
THIS
UH YE YEAH

YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT TO
YEAH
EXA THAT'S THE INTENTION THERE
SURE
MM YE
NO NO NO NO NO
IT I
YEAH
SURELY THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT ACTUALLY
SO MAYBE LIKE WE HAD TO DO THIS END POINT DETECTION AND PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OF FINAL FILTERING
AND THEN I THINK YOU SHOULD BE PRETTY MUCH CONVERGING TO THE SYSTEM
BUT THE STILL THE REASON WITH THE THE THEY HAD LIKE WHAT ARE THE SYSTEMS WE TRAIN ON DATABASES ARE THEY ARE CHOP NEATLY
THAT THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH SILENCE BEGINNING NOT TOO MUCH SILENCE AT THE END
THEY ARE THEY ARE J THEY THEY CHOPPED SO NEATLY FOR THE IT LIKE CUSTOM MADE DATABASE
BUT UH HERE IT'S NOT LIKE THAT YOU KNOW LIKE UH-HUH
YEAH
THERE ARE THE SEVERAL THINGS
LIKE ONE THING IS LIKE WE CAN DO THIS BEGIN AND END DETECTION AS WE SAID
OR YOU AND HE CAN UH WE CAN TRY TO USE UH FRANCE TELECOM'S UH APPROACH ACTUALLY
AND THAT UM UH UH THEY THEY HAVE THIS FRONT END WHICH UH UH WHICH WHICH CAN DO A SPECTRAL
AND PLUS IT CAN GIVE YOU A VOICE ACTIVITY DETECTION
PART F PART FROM BASIS IT CAN GIVE
SO SOMETHI WE CAN JUST YEAH WE CAN JUST RUN IT QUICKLY AND SEE
AND PROBABLY YOU WILL HAVE TO RUN IT
WILL GIVE YOU THE IDEA THAT IS IT OKAY LIKE
YEAH
NO NO NO NO
UH NOT RUNNING I MEAN TO SAY P PROBABLY UH HE SHOULD RUN IT OR UH LIKE WE CAN GE HELP HIM TO RUN IT ACTUALLY
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT HE HAS TO GET INTO
UH
I MEAN TO SAY I I MEAN TO SAY THAT IT'S OKAY
WE HAVE ALL THE SCRIPTS
BUT PROBABLY UH HE SHOULD RUN IT I MEAN TO SAY
IT'S A
THE ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS PROBABLY
UH THE THEY ARE UH THE SCRI BECAUSE UP TO UH PROBABLY MAYBE WE SHALL DO MM IT YEAH
UH FOR TO MAKE IT FASTER WE SHOULD RU IT RUN MAYBE
IF WE RUN F WE OURSELF IT IT'S VERY FAST
UH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM OKAY
NO BUT I MEAN TO SAY THAT IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU GIVE HIM THE SCRIPTS AND ASK HIM TO RUN UH THE
UH NO
YEAH
BUT IT'S UH
YEAH
YEAH OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT UH-HUH
NO NO NO NO I THE END POINT SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT THING NO
THAT'S AND WE NEED IT FOR AMI PLUS OTHER THING
AND SO BUT THE I AM TO ALL SAYING YEAH
I I AM
IT'S N IT UH NO NO NO IT'S NOT SPEECH NON SPEECH
UH UH IT'S UH IT'S UH IT'S YEAH

IT'S NOT SILENT
IT'S UH YOU CAN SAY THAT'S VERY YEAH
AND IT CAN BE IT CAN BE ANYTHING
YEAH
BREATHING
YEAH
NO ANYWAY SO WE OKAY SO WE'LL FINISH THIS CALL ROUTING STUFF
WHAT DO YOU SAY ALL THI THIS IS OKAY WITH YOU RIGHT
SO WE'LL K BECAUSE I THINK UH IT IT IT HAS NOT BEEN EVEN SUBMITTED OUTSIDE ALSO THE WORK WHAT JEAN YVES DID YET
MM YEAH NOT DONE THAT YET
TRIED
UH YEAH HE STILL YEAH
UH UH
YEAH
SO YEAH IT IT'S PRETTY MUCH GOOD TIME ALSO NO
AND HE C HE CAN AND UH WHEN DO YOU INTEND TO START WRITING THE PROPOSAL
PROBABLY YOU SHOULD START I THINK
S SLOW
LITTLE BIT START THINKING
NO NO YOU YOU SHOULD NOT WAIT TILL THE END
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN TO SAY
UH YES
BECAUSE YOU
BECAUSE IT
OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
UH
YEAH IT CAN GO THERE YEAH
SEE
NO NO NO
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S GOOD IF HE SUBMITS HIS PR PROPOSAL
AS A RESEARCH REPORT YOU PUT HERE SUBMIT IT FOR THE CONFERENCE
IT'S QUITE GOOD FOR THE PROPOSAL DIRECTLY
YEAH
YEAH
NO
I THINK UH WE WE MAY HAVE TO LIKE IT CAN HAVE A UH IT'S IT'S KIND OF LIKE UH UH MAYBE TAKE LIKE UH UH TWO OR THREE DAYS
YOU KNOW LIKE TO SIT OUT AND SAY UH ONE CONVERGE TO ONE APPROACH AND THEN JUST DO WITHOUT THAT YEAH
AND PROBABLY YEAH
SO THAT IS THE THING
WE HAVE TO SORT OUT THE BUG KIND OF THING AND SEE HOW RELIABLE IS THIS END POINT DETECTION FOR US
YEAH MM-HMM
UH YEAH I THINK UH THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO C. T. S. ACTUALLY
YEAH
OKAY
AND UH YEAH SO THAT IS THIS
SO YOU WANTED TO TALK SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
WELL WE OBSTRUCTED YOU WITH THAT
YOU WANTED TO TALK SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALSO
NO
OR MAYBE ANOTHER MEETING

SO I SAID THERE'S SOME PROBLEM WITH YOURS UH YOUR UH UH THE WAY HE UH PUT THE ROLL INSIDE
THERE IS SOME PROBLEM IT HAS GOT STUCK SOMEWHERE
IT CAN NEVER GO TO FORTY ONE FORTY YEAH I UH UH THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT IS FINE
FORTY FORTY ONE IS BUT SEE HE HAS ALREADY
DON'T LISTEN
OKAY
HOLD THAT
OKAY
OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
I THINK FOR US IT'S JUST LIKE A NORMAL WHITEBOARD BUT THEY'LL BE RECORDING WHAT WE WRITE DOWN
MM
MM
BUT FOR US IT'S JUST LIKE A NORMAL WHITEBOARD
MM-HMM
I HAVE TO DRAW
M MY MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
SORRY THIS IS ALL TANGLED UP HERE
THAT'S BETTER
MM-HMM
I'M A VERY BAD DRAWER
WEIRD
UM
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GUESS FROM MY DRAWING
I'M A BAD DRAWER
OKAY
THEY'RE EARS BY THE WAY
NO
UM CLOSE THOUGH
OKAY SO LIKE A PET ANIMAL
LIKE A CAT
NO NOT A CAT THOUGH
OKAY
SO
IT'S NOT A CAT IT'S A DOG
YES
IT'S GOT A TAIL THEN
YEAH YEAH
SO DO CATS
AND YOU GUESSED CATS WITHOUT A TAIL
OKAY
OKAY THERE YOU GO
SO WHAT FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS
UH
DOGS ARE ALWAYS FRIENDLY AND LOYAL AND FUN
A HORSE
THIS IS WHY YOU'RE THE DESIGNER
AND I'M MARKETING
AH
MM-HMM
THAT'S IT
A BLUE AND BLACK ZEBRA
THE VERY RARE BLUE ZEBRAS
YES
YOU GOT A LOT OF ROOM HERE
YOU CAN PROBABLY REACH
NO
I TOOK A DOG
UM
A MOUSE
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT'S A VERY BIG RAT

MM
I'M MARKETING
YEP
MM-HMM
ANNA
MM
MM
YEAH
OTH YEAH
MM
MM
MM
BUT WE CAN'T REALLY DESIGN FOR SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN INVENTED YET
MM
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
BUT
NINETY PERCENT OF THE TIME NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME PEOPLE WILL BE USING THE MAIN FUNCTIONS THE VOLUME THE DIFFERENT CHANNELS
SO WE CAN HAVE ALL THE FANCY THINGS AS WELL BUT THE MAIN CONTROLS NEED TO BE VERY OBVIOUS AND VERY EASY TO USE
MM
MM
MM
SO TRY AND GET T. V. MANUFACTURERS TO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO WE UH WE WILL WAIT FOR ANNA A FEW MINUTES
I THINK IT SHOULD WORK LIKE THIS
SO I WILL TRY TO GET MY PRESENTATION RUNNING
MM
IT'S NO MATTER

SO GOOD MORNING EVERYONE
UM
WELCOME AT UH AT THE KICK OFF MEETING OF OUR UH LATEST PROJECT
I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE BEEN UH UPDATED ABOUT IT
GOOD
SO W WE WILL TRY TO STRUCTURE THIS UH MEETING WITH AN A WITH AN AGENDA UH AS PRESENTED HERE
UM AFTER THE OPENING WE WILL TR GET ACQUAINTED TO EACH OTHER
SEE WHAT OUR ROLES ARE IN THIS PROJECT
SO UM
WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH UH SOME UH W TECHNICAL TOOLS TO UH
TO COMMUNICATE AND TO WELL LEARN FROM EACH OTHER'S PLANS UH AS I CAN SAY UM SO W
WE WILL ALSO TRY TO UH
TO GET ACQUAINTED TO THIS TOOLS SO THEY ARE ALSO NEW TO ME I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WORKED WITH THEM BEFORE
UM THEN WE WILL COME TO THE UH TO THE TO THE ACTUAL PROJECT PLAN
YOU ALL KNOW I HOPE HOW IT'S ABOUT UH THE UH NEW R REMOTE CONTROL WE ARE GOING GOING TO DESIGN
UH THEN WE WILL UH DISCUSS UH WELL HOW IT SHOULD BE AND UH
WH WHAT UH WHAT OUR NEW PRODUCT SHOULD LOOK LITE LIKE
AND UH WELL THEN UH AFTER SOME TWENTY FIVE MINUTES I HOPE UH WE CAN END THIS MEETING
SO
UM BASICALLY THIS IS ABOUT A UH A NEW C REMOTE CONTROL
UM
WE WHEN YOU DESIGN A NEW PRODUCT YOU OF UH YOU OF COURSE WANT IT TO BE ORIGINAL
BE UH WE WANT TO BE DISTINGUISHED MM
PEOPLE UH WANT TO UH WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE SHELF WANT TO THINK WELL THAT'S THE PRODUCT I I NEED
SO IT NEEDS TO BE TRENDY
I MEAN TRENDY IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT SO THEN I W THEY WILL BUY OUR PRODUCT
BUT THEN UH IT ALSO SHOULD WORK UH USER FRIENDLY AND UH OTHERWISE PEOPLE UH UH WELL IT WILL NOT BE UH
BE RATED VERY WELL IN CONSUMER UH ARTICLES AND LIKE THAT
SO THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF UH NEW PROJECT WILL BE WE FIRST UH GO THROUGH A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN PHASE
UM
YOU ALL GET UH UM CERTAIN TASK UH IN THIS UH IN THIS PHASE AND UH
THEN WE WILL MEET AGAIN AND UH DISCUSS THIS FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
AND THE SAME HOLDS FOR THE UH
PH TWO PHASES UH AFTER THIS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
AND AFTER THAT A A MORE DETAILED DESIGN IN WHICH THE THE FINAL PROJECT SHOULD GET ITS DEFINITE SHAPE
ALRIGHT BUT FIRST WE WILL DO SOME UH TOOL TRAINING
IN ALL IN FRONT OF YOU UH YOU SEE UH THE UH
NOTEBOOKS AND W UH N NOTE BLOCKS AND WE HAVE HERE A
A A A WHITE BOARD
AND UM WELL IT SHOULD WORK UH I'VE READ IT FROM MY UH FROM SOME COLLEAGUE THAT IT SHOULD WORK WITH SOME KIND OF TOOLBAR
I DIDN'T FIND OUT YET HOW IT WORK BUT MAYBE ONE OF YOU DID SO
UM
YES
DO DO WE HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
I I I'M NOT FULLY UPDATED ABOUT THIS SHARED FOLDER UH
YES WELL WE WILL THEN FIND OUT HO HOW IT WORKS
UM
WELL THIS SEEMS TO ME YES SOME COMPUTER PROGRAM BUT I DIDN'T FIND IT YET
SO WE'LL COME TO THAT LATER
SO UH NOW WE WILL TRY OUT THE WHITE BOARD WE HAVE HERE
SO
I WOULD SUGGEST UH
WELL YES UM WE UH WE SHOULD TRY TO T TO DRAW ON IT AND THEN WELL IT SHOULD BE SMART SOME WAY
I I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW THIS WORKS BUT
YES A GOOD IDEA MAEL
OKAY
'KAY

THING
UH WHEN WE ARE AND WHEN W YOU ARE UH GOING TO DESIGN W UH WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT UH WILL BE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
SO WHEN
DESIGNING A PROJECT UH I ALSO LOOK AT YOU UH MAEL KEEP IN MIND UH UH UH PEOPLE UH
WANT TO GET THE FEELING THIS IS A TWENTY FIVE EURO PROJECT UH PR UM
PRODUCT
YES
OKAY
UM MORE INTERESTING FOR OUR COMPANY OF COURSE P UH PROFIT AIM ABOUT FIFTY MILLION EURO
SO WE HAVE TO SELL UH QUITE A LOT OF THIS UH UM THINGS
UH WE WILL TRY TO UH
TO GET AT A INTERNATIONAL MARKET UH SO UM IT WILL BE I THINK MAINLY EUROPE AND UH NORTHERN AMERICA
MAYBE SOME UH ASIAN COUNTRIES
UM ALSO IMPORTANT FOR YOU ALL IS UM THE THE PRODUCT UH PRODUCTION COST MUST BE MAXIMAL UH TWELVE UH TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS
YES OF COURSE
UH UM I MEAN WE STILL HAVE TO UH TO MAKE A PROFIT HUH
YOU ALL HAVE TO BE PAID
EXCUSE ME
YES INDEED
SO UH WELL I THINK W WHEN WE ARE WORKING ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET
UH IN PRINCIPLE IT HAS ENOUGH CUSTOMERS UH SO WHEN WE HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT WE UH WE COULD UH MEET THIS THIS AIM I THINK
SO THAT ABOUT FINANCE
AND UH NOW JUST LET HAVE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT IS A GOOD REMOTE CONTROL AND UH WELL KEEP IN MIND THIS THIS FIRST POINT
IT HAS TO BE ORIGINAL IT HAS TO BE TRENDY IT HAS TO BE USER FRIENDLY
UM MAYBE SOMEONE CAN MENTION SOME ADDITIONAL UH PREREQUISITES FOR A GOOD REMOTE CONTROL
YES WELL I IT SHOULD HAVE THE THE THE THE EXPECTED FUNCTIONALITY UH OF A REMOTE CONTROL
WE WER WE WERE THINKING TELEVISION
UH
MM-HMM
YES YES
TH TH THAT'S VERY HANDY I I ALWAYS MISS IT AND ON SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT YOU CAN GO CHANNEL UP OR DOWN INS INSTEAD OF RETYPING THE NUMBER
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHANNELS
YES
YES
A AND I'M NANNE
SO
YES
SO
UM
S
S S
ARE THERE SOME OTHER VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO TO DO WELL
TO SPECIFY IN THIS FIRST PHASE OF OF THE PROJECT
SO THE BROWSE FUNCTION AS YOU M MENTIONED
YES
YEAH
YES
MM WELL UH I I THINK
UH W Y YOU TWO SHOULD SHOULD I THINK THINK THIS OVER UH W ESPEC WHAT WHAT FUNCTIONALITY
MM-HMM
MM MM MM
KEEP K KEEP IN MIND I IT'S A IT'S A TWENTY FIVE EURO UNIT SO UH UH THE THE VERY FANCY STUFF UH
W WE CAN LEAVE THAT OUT I THINK
SO TWENTY FIVE EURO YOU EXPECT A QUITE WELL NORMAL BUT GOOD FUNCTIONING USER FRIENDLY REMOTE CONTROL
YES BUT BUT BUT AB ABOUT THE SPEC THE BUTTONS THE BUTTONS UH THAT WILL BE ON IT
I I THINK WE CAN DISCUSS THAT IN THE IN THE NEXT MEETING
UH I WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS WRAPPED UP AND GO TO AN END OF THIS MEETING
SO
SO YOU KNOW NOW THE BASIC THE BASIC THINGS
AND
WELL JUST JUST FOR THE NEXT MEETING UM
WELL UH YOU WOR YES WORK ON A DESIGN
KEEP IT GENERAL I MEAN SO W WE WILL BE STILL FLE FLEXIBLE WITH MAYBE ADDING SOME FUNCTIONS
SO
UM
YOU WILL BE WORKING ON ON
TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN SO
AND UH YOU AND YOU AND UH UH UH WELL THINK ABOUT REQUIREMENTS EH
DOES IT NEED INTERNET OR OR DO DO WE STAY AT
BASIC BASIC TELEVISION UH INTERFACE
SO UH
I THINK WE SHOULD NOW ALL GO WORK UH UH AT THIS AND UH YOU WILL BE INFORMED VIA EMAIL AND OTHER KIND OF COMMUNICATION
SO NEXT MEETING WILL BE IN UH IN THIRTY MINUTES UH
K KEEP IT IN MIND
OKAY
NO I DON'T THINK SO IT HAS TO BE LIKE THAT YEAH AND YOU HAVE TO ADJUST THE LENGTH
OKAY AND THEN
YEAH S YEAH UM
I THINK YOU CAN PUT ANYWHERE YOU WANT ACTUALLY
I THIN
IT'S NOT A DIRECTIONAL MIC ANYWAY
UH
YEAH
LAST
OKAY
OKAY
'KAY
ALT F. FIVE
SO
YES
TOTAL
WHITEBO
YEAH YOU CAN START IT YOU KNOW
NO THEY WILL RECORD THROUGH THAT
THERE'S A SENSOR OVER THERE WHICH IS GOING TO RECORD THE STROKES THAT YOU MAKE
YEAH
YEAH
'S A CAT
YEAH
AH YOU FORGET ABOUT IT
YEAH UH I THINK IT'S FINE
I JUST DON'T WANT TO CARRY IT OFF
MAN THIS WIRES EH
WE NEED A WIRELESS MICROPHONE
YOU KNOW
PRO SPECIALLY WE SHOULD NEXT PROJECT WE SHOULD TAKE L LIKE THAT
SO
OH THE DOG DOESN'T HAVE A TAIL
YEAH SURE YEAH
I THOUGHT SO
THE DOGS HAVE A TAIL
YEAH
IT'LL STILL NOT EXTEND RIGHT
IT'S NOT UP TO THAT
IT'S A HORSE
AH I THINK YOU CAN PUT THAT
I'LL TELL TO GET IT OFF MY
UH
MM-HMM
OH Y IT'S NOT FOR THAT
NO
OKAY
YEAH
SO WHAT SHOULD I DRAW
MM
HE HAS ALREADY TO DO CAT
SO
THE CAT IS GOING TO EAT THE FISH OR THE RAT
AH IT'S A BABY SHARK IT LOOKS TO ME YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO EAT THE CAT RATHER THAN THE CAT EATING THE FISH NO
YOU SHOULD GO FOR THE NEXT ONE IT SEEMS TO ME
TWENTY FOUR
AH YEAH THE SALE MAN FOUR MILLION
THEY HAVE TO SELL AT LEAST FOUR MILLION TO MAKE A PROFIT
AH WE HAVE TO MAKE WE HAVE TO SELL AT LEAST FOUR MILLION TO MAKE OUR OWN PROFIT
FIFTY MILL
OF COURSE IT SHOULD HAVE A ON OFF BUTTON
YEAH S AND IT DEPENDS WHAT APPLICATION YOU ARE USING IT FOR
YOU MIGHT NEED UH
WE ARE TARG TARGETING THE TELEVISION SET
SO YOU NEED TO RECORD THE CHANNELS
YOU NEED TO BROWSE THE BROWSE THE CHANNELS IN UPWARD DOWNWARD WAY
UH
AND
UH AND
MARKETING
YEAH
YEAH
SURE
OH
I'M MATTHEW
YOU KNOW
MATTH S UH ANNA
AND UM UH MATTHEW YEAH
I THI THINK YOU KNOW ME YEAH
RIGHT YEAH
SO
SO
AND UH
YOU'D NEED THE USUAL ONES LIKE THE CHANGING THE VOLUME CHANGING THE THE CHANNEL AND THEN YOU UH TODAY WE HAVE UH UM TELETEXT AND ALL THOSE THINGS
TOMORROW YOU MIGHT HAVE A SOME MORE FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT COME THROUGH THAT SO
YEAH I. P. O. OR
NOW WE ARE LOOKING FOR
TELEVISION THINGS OR I. P.
FOR EXAMPLE PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDER AND ALL THOSE STUFFS ARE COMING UP
YEAH
AH IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S COMING UP ACTUALLY
THE PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDER AND ALL THOSE THINGS IT IS COMING UP
LET'S LET'S TAKE
OH IN THAT CASE YOU CAN YOU ALWAYS HOOK UP WITH UH SOMEONE WHO IS PROVIDING THAT AND YOU KNOW
YOU YOU SELL THEIR PRODUCT AS WELL AS YOUR PRODUCT WITH THEM YOU KNOW
YEAH
NO IT'S OKAY YEAH I UNDERSTAND
SO WE NEED SOME NUMBERING BUTTONS SOME TELETEXT THINGS AND THEN UM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY WE ARE ALREAD MM
MM
YEAH
L
YEAH SURE
STAM
OKAY
OR YOU GET IT
OKAY
MM
YOURS IS WELL
YEAH BUT THE THE MIC SHOULD NOT
YEAH
MM
CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT
OKAY IT'S Y YEAH
RIGHT
THEN PRESS UH AL
THIS
YOU KNOW
OH OH
RIGHT WELL
WOW
AMAZING
IT'S WORKING
YEAH
UNDER DOCUMENTS IN THE SHARED FOLDER
OKAY
YEAH I GUESS WE'LL HAVE A SHARED FOLDER UH WITH DOCUMENTS THAT WE CAN SHARE
AND UH YEAH
YES
EACH OF US IS GOING
OKAY SHALL I START
SO I
BUT IT'S
ACTUALLY I THINK I CANNOT GO WITH UH
YEAH
OKAY
YOU'RE ON THE KNIFE
MAEL
YEAH I THINK I WILL GO WITHOUT WITHOUT IT RIGHT
YEAH
AND WE SHOULD SUM UP ITS FAVOURITE CHARAS CHARACTERISTICS RIGHT
SO
UH YEAH
AND I TH THEY LIKE TO SLEEP THAT'S WHY YOU SAID YOU THEY ARE LIKE THIS
YEAH
SHE HAS THE SMALL LEGS
YEAH
THANK YOU MATTHEW
PERFECT
OH A RAT OKAY
AND YOU
A BIRD
OKAY IN THE WATER
MM
YEAH
PUT IT COLOURS
MAYBE IT WOULD HELP US
WITH DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS
AH IT'S A SHARK YEAH
OH
YOU HAVE SOME IN IN AUSTRALIA RIGHT
YEAH
I DUNNO
OH WELL
YEAH
PERFECT
SO I DUNNO IF WE NEED TO SPEND TIME ON THAT ACTUALLY BUT UH
YEAH EXACTLY YEAH
WOW
YEAH
PER REMOTE CONTROL YEAH
PER PROJECT
SO IT'S HALF OF THE SELLING PRICE IF I AM GOOD IN MATHEMATICS
OF COURSE
OH YOU'RE G VERY GOOD IN MATHEMATICS
FOUR MILLION
YEAH
AND UH JUST BEFORE STARTING THE DETAILED DISCUSSION MAYBE WE YOU ARE THE MARKETING GUY
OR TH SO YOU ARE THE MARKETING
AND YOU ARE IN THE U USE USER INTERFACE UH DESIGN
SO JUST YEAH I WANTED TO TO BE SURE
AND I I'M THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER OKAY
BECAUSE I I DON'T KNOW YOU VERY WELL ACTUALLY BUT YEAH
OKAY
MAEL
HAPPY TO MEET YOU
OKAY
IT'S VERY UH
UH SO YEAH UH JUST UH ON YOUR WEB PAGE BUT UH YEAH NOT UH NOT FACE TO FACE
SO MM
SO I
LIKE WHAT
LIKE INTERNET ON THE ON T. V.
YEAH
ACTUALLY YEAH W
OF COURSE AND FIRST BEFORE UM DESIGNING THE FUNC WELL THINKING ABOUT THE FUNCTIONALITIES WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE USER REQUIREMENTS
UM THEN IF THEY NEED INTERNET THEN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TO P TO PROPOSE SOMETHING WITH UH UH T. V. OVER I. P.
BUT BEFORE
YEAH BUT W W WE WANT TO DESIGN A NEW ONE
MM
YEAH
THE YEAH THE MAIN IS BROWSING
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
PERFECT
MM-HMM
WHAT'S THE AGENDA FOR THIS MEETING
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
YEAH
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION YEAH
NO I DON'T
I WASN'T
NO
I C I CAN TALK ABOUT IT BUT I HAVE NO SLIDES OR ANYTHING
MM-HMM
WELL I'VE JUST BEEN UM PRESENTED WITH SOME RESEARCH WE'VE DONE IN A SMALL FOCUS GROUP SO A HUNDRED PEOPLE
JUST ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR REMOTE CONTROL USAGE HABITS AND WHAT THEY WANT IN A REMOTE CONTROL
UM
IT'S PROBABLY CAN'T EMAIL THIS TO YOU I'VE JUST GOT A WEB PAGE WITH SOME DATA ON IT
UM BASICALLY IT'S SAYING THAT
USERS GENERALLY DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS
UM SEVENTY FIVE U SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
UM
EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY
UM
CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER
UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS SAID THEY ZAP A LOT SO THEY USE THEIR REMOTE CONTROL QUITE FREQUENTLY WHILE THEY'RE WATCHING TELEVISION
UH
FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS SAY THAT THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
SO THEY'VE GOT A REMOTE CONTROL WITH A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY BUT REALLY MOST OF THE TIME THEY ONLY USE A SMALL PART OF THAT
UM
I HAVE AN A WEB PAGE YES
YEP
YEP SURE
MM-HMM
SO BASICALLY UM THERE'S A BREAKDOWN OF HOW MUCH THEY USE THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ON A REM REMOTE CONTROL
UM POWER AND VOLUME SELECTION ARE ONLY USED A FEW TIMES WITHIN THIS UH PER HOUR
UM CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES UM AND THEN THERE'S THINGS LIKE CHANNEL SETTINGS AUDIO SETTINGS WHICH ARE ONLY USED VERY INFREQUENTLY
UM
TELETEXT IS USED UM FOURTEEN TIMES IN THE HOUR SO IT IS USED BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE CHANNEL SELECTION IS USED
UM
AN INTERESTING THING THAT THIS REPORT HAS BROUGHT UP IS THAT UM FIFTY FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS REPORT THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL GETS LOST A LOT OF THE TIME IN THE ROOM
SO SOME WAY OF SOME WAY OF LOCATING THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO A LOT OF USERS
UM
THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAID IT TAKES TOO LONG TO LEARN TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL THEY WANT SOMETHING THAT'S EASIER TO USE STRAIGHT AWAY MORE INTUITIVE PERHAPS
UM
THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SAID IT TOOK TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN TO USE A NEW ONE
YEP
UM
AND THIRTY TWENTY SIX PERCENT SAID REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR R. S. I.
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'D GO ABOUT COMBATING THAT
FOR R. S. I.
RESPET REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
SO
BUT
MM
YEAH
THAT'S WHAT THE REPORT SAYS YEAH
UM AND THEN IT'S GOT A DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN ON
UH I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IF I EMAIL IT TO YOU NOW
OH NO YEAH
YEAH
UM S HANG ON
WELL
OH I NEED TO MUCK AROUND WITH THIS
IT'S PROBABLY EASIER IF YOU PUT IT ON YOURS AND THEN I'LL JUST EMAIL IT TO YOU
IT'S JUST A WEB LINK
ONE THING IT GOES ON TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS INTERESTING IS THE HANG ON A MINUTE
MM-HMM
YEP
UM ONE THING IS INTERESTING IS TALKING ABOUT
UM SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
AND WHO WOULD PAY MORE FOR THAT AND WHETHER PEOPLE WOULD FIND IT USEFUL
YES I'LL JUST GET THIS UP
WELL POTENTIALLY YEAH UM
I THINK EVEN FOR INTERESTI YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD NOT WORK SO WELL
YOU WANNA HAVE BOTH OPTIONS
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
UM
WELL
THIS IS NOW TALKING ABOUT UM WHO WOULD PAY FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL WHO WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT UM
NINETY PERCENT OF THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MARKET SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY MORE
IT GOES DOWN FROM THERE SEVENTY SIX PERCENT FOR TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT FOR THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE UM TWENTY TWO PERCENT FOR FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE AND THEN EIGHT PERCENT FOR FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY FIVE
YEAH
BUT WE SH YEAH IT REALLY DEPENDS WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE TARGETING THIS PRODUCT UM WHICH WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT LATER I THINK
DID YOU GET THE EMAIL
YEP THAT ONE
JUST FOLLOW THAT LINK
IT'LL BE IN A DIFFERENT WINDOW YEP
THAT'S LEFT THAT ONE
YEP
MM
SO THAT'S THE FIGURE THAT I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THERE WITH THE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS
ANOTHER THING IT'S TALKING ABOUT THERE IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN BUT THERE'S NO FIGURES APPARENTLY ON THAT
SORRY
OH
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
WELL
YOU DREW IT A LONG TIME AGO
NINETY ONE
AH
THAT'S HANDY
SO IF THE B T. V. IN THE NEXT APARTMENT'S REALLY LOUD YOU CAN JUST TURN IT OFF
YEAH
I LIKE THAT IDEA
MM-HMM
YEP
MM-HMM
OKAY
HOW WOULD THAT WORK
SO YOU'VE GOT SAY MAYBE A V. C. R. AND A T. V. WHICH ARE SEPARATE
SO YOU ON MY ONE AT HOME I'VE GOT A V. C. R. REMOTE WHICH THEN CHANGES THE CHANNEL ON THE V. C. R. AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ON THE T. V.
SO IS IT GONNA BE LIKE A SWITCH ON THE REMOTE THAT SAYS T USE THE T. V. OR USE THE V. C. R.
OR DOES IT KNOW WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO USE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH
MM
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE HERE
THAT'S YEAH
MM
MM
BECAUSE Y
MM-HMM
MM
MM
YEP
MM
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
MM
MM
SO D. V. D. S AND V. C. R. S
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM
BUT I THINK TAKING THE IDEA OF GETTING INSPIRATION FROM MOBILE PHONES IS INTERESTING ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING AFTER A YOUNGER MARKET
THAT'S THE THE THE MM THE NEW AND THE FUNKY THINGS THAT'S YEAH
THERE'S LOT THERE'S LOTS OF PRETTY MOBILE PHONES NOT TOO MANY PRETTY REMOTE CONTROLS
THAT'S
MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
HOW MUCH LONGER HAVE WE GOT FOR THE MEETING BY THE WAY
'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT DEMOGRAPHIC AT ALL AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM
MM
YEAH
WHICH I THINK IS QUITE TRICKY
UM BASICALLY WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO BUY A REMOTE CONTROL WOULDN'T THEY ALREADY HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH THEIR TELEVISION WHEN THEY BUY ONE
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE MORE FUNCTIONALITY 'CAUSE IT'S ONLY A LOW MARKET IT'S A CHEAP END REMOTE CONTROL
WE CAN'T BEAT MODERN FUNCTIONALITY WE MIGHT WE'LL BE ABLE TO BEAT THEM ON TH THE LOOK OF IT
TH THE DESIGN OF IT BUT THAT'S NOT A BIG SELLER
IF THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO BUY A NEW REMOTE CONTROL JUST 'CAUSE IT LOOKS PRETTY THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY NEED IT AS WELL
SO I'M NOT SURE HOW WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO BUY THIS THING
MM
YEAH
BUT WHY ARE THEY BUYING ONE IN THE FIRST PLACE
MM
BUT IF PEOPLE ARE BUYING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR FUNCTIONALITY THEY'LL BUY A UNIVERSAL REMOTE
I'VE GOT FRIENDS WHO'VE GOT SO MANY THINGS THEY NEED A UNIVERSAL REMOTE OTHERWISE THEY'RE USING FIVE DIFFERENT REMOTES FOR THEIR ALL THEIR THINGS
IN THAT CASE THEY WOULDN'T BUY OUR PRODUCT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY
WELL WE CAN'T WITH THE PRICE RANGE
WE WE'RE NOT BUILDING A UNIVERSAL REMOTE WE'RE NOT BUILDING A HIGH END PRODUCT
MM
MM-HMM
MM
BUT YEAH
IF WE'RE GETTING INTO UNIVERSAL REMOTE TERRITORY WE'RE GETTING TO L. C. D. SCREENS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH WOULD DRIVE THE COST UP A LOT
FOR UNIVERSAL REMOTES
IF YOU MM
AND QUITE COMPLICATED TO USE YES
MM-HMM
NOT AS FLEXIBLE MAYBE YEAH BUT S YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT IF WE'RE GOING FOR THE SAY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AGE GROUP THEN NOT MANY OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY OWN T. V. S TO USE A REMOTE CONTROL ON
OKAY
SO THEY'RE YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEP
I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT THE THE PRICE RANGE FOR REMOTE CONTROLS IS
ARE WE GONNA BE AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE PRICE RANGE OR ARE WE KIND OF MIDDLE TO BOTTOM
I DON'T KNOW
MM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
YEAH
SO I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE FROM A UNIVERSAL REMOTE IS MAYBE CHOOSING BETWEEN THREE DEVICES
BEING ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM THERE MAY BE STEREO V. C. R. AND T. V.
AND JUST BE ABLE TO S USE THEM ALL FROM THE SAME REMOTE BUT NOT AT THE SAME TIME
MM
MM-HMM YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO I SEE ALL EVERYBODY'S HERE 'KAY
AND WE CAN START MEETING
THE I WILL UH
PRESENT HERE AGENDA WITH WITH WITH WITH SLIDES
TO YOU
UM
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE
SO FIRST UH JUST TO MENTION I WILL
TAKE NOTES UH OF THIS MEETING AND UH I WILL TRY TO WORK THEM OUT AND GIVE THEM TO YOU
I'VE ALSO MADE NOTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING AND UM I WAS ABOUT TO SEND THEM YOU BUT THEN UH I HAD TO GO TO THIS UH MEETING SO YOU WILL GET THEM TOO UH
UM
YES
INDEED
UM
THEN I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE UH WORKED OUT SOME SOME UH SOME SOME PRESENTATIONS ABOUT UH ABOUT WELL YOU THE THE TASK GIVEN TO YOU IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING
UM
W WE WILL UH IN A MINUTE WE WILL UH START WITH THEM
UM WE WILL SEE IN WHICH ORDER WE WILL HANDLE THEM OF
UM THEN I WILL UH BRING IN SOME SOME SOME NEW REQUIREMENTS I I GOT UH FROM THE UH ACCOUNT MANAGER
I TRY TO WORK THEM OUT THEY WERE QUITE ABSTRACT AND WE CAN HAVE MAYBE HAVE COM SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT IT
UH UM ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS AND WELL IN THIS MEETING WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO REACH A DECISION ABOUT THE TARGET GROUP
AND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE
YES I MEAN WELL YES W WHO ARE WE GOING TO UH TO WELL TO SELL THIS THE CUSTOMERS INDEED YES
THINK THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT MATTER
UH
SO AND THEN UH WE WILL CLOSE THIS MEETING UH AND AFTER THIS MEETING WE'LL UH WE'LL HAVE A LUNCH
GOOD
UM
MAYBE UM
WHY UH ANNA CAN YOU C DO YOU HAVE A PRESENTATIONS
YOU DON'T HAVE PRESENTATION
UH YOU WANT A TABLE TO TO UH
YES YES MAYBE MAYBE YOU CAN UH CAN JUST TALK ABOUT IT OR MAYBE YOU CAN USE THE WHITEBOARD IF NECESSARY UM
MM-HMM
MM
DO YOU DO YOU HAVE THIS UH INFORMATION ON THE WEB PAGE YOU SAID
YES MAYB MAYBE YOU CAN CAN SEND AN EMAIL TO ME LATER UH
UH ABOUT THIS
MM
MM
YES YES I HAVE THAT TOO
MM
MM
THEY THINK THAT OR DO THEIR DOCTOR THE DOCTOR SAYS
BUT IT'S IT'S THE OPINION OF THE UH OF THE USERS HUH
SO MM
YOU CAN MAYBE JUST JUST
HMM
MM-HMM
D DO YOU HAVE NUMBERS O O ON THAT
WELL IT WOULD IT WOULD BE A SOLUTION FOR UH WHEN YOUR
REMOTE CONTROL IS LOST I MEAN WHEN IT HAS SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN
UH I THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IT IS MY WELL IT'S WE SHOULD BE IN RANGE
OR MAYBE IT CAN RESPOND AND PRODUCE SOUND SO SAY WHERE IT IS
BUT THE THESE ARE ALL QUITE FANCY FEATURES I'M NOT SURE WHETHER
WE WILL WE CAN MAKE THIS FOR FOR TWELVE EURO FI AND FIFTY CENTS
MM
YES THAT THAT THAT THAT'S MM
DO YOU HAVE SOME MORE IMPORTANT FACTS OR
CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION
MM
MM-HMM
DECLINE WITH AGE MM
MM
YES
WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT LATER
OKAY
MM
OKAY
UM
UH MAYBE UH MAEL C C CAN YOU GIVE UH UH YOUR PRESENTATION UH
OH THIS IS
MM-HMM Y Y YOU CAN MOVE UH
YES
YOU CAN YOU CAN SA TAKE MY CHAIR
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UH-HUH
IS HUH
OVERWHELMING
NO
AND AND WHY DO YOU WANT THESE KIND OF COMPONENT
I MEAN ARE THEY CHEAP OR ARE THEY UH RELIABLE
WHAT WERE YOUR
MM
YES
IT IT
IT'S MORE CLEAR NOW I THINK
SO
MM-HMM
WHAT I W WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT UH THE THE THE SCHEMA UH ABOUT UH THE SENDER AND THE RECEIVER
I MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU GET BACK TO IT
YEAH UH THE RECEIVER IS OF COURSE ALREADY IN THE TELEVISION AND WE ARE NOT UH ABLE TO CHANGE IT
SO WE WE MUST ADAPT TO THE TO THE RECEIVER
I I SUPPOSE THERE IS A STANDARD UH WAY OF COMMUNICATING TO TELEVISIONS UH
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM
MM
YES
OKAY
THANK YOU
MM
YEAH YES I I I
I I FEEL I I I THINK M MAEL WILL WILL CONSIDER THIS UH TH THESE THINGS
MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN GO TO TO YOUR PRESENTATION UH MATTHEW
I I I ASSUME YOU WERE FINISHED HERE
UH OKAY
OH
I
UH SORRY
I KNOW WHERE IT IS
IT'S UH
YES
IT'S UH
MM-HMM
MM
MM MM MM MM MM
MM YES BUT I THINK IT'S I I IT'S ALREADY THERE I MEAN THE HARD DISK UH RECORDERS UH I I'VE SEEN THEM IN THE SHOP
W W W W WE NEED TO DECIDE ON ON ON ON IN HOW FAR WE GO TO IN THIS
MEAN YOU CAN GO PRETTY FAR I F I THINK WITH WITH WITH FUNCTIONS AND POSSIBLE UH FUTURE P UH PROSPECTS YES
BUT IT'S GOOD TO KEEP IN MIND
MM
VERY WELL
GOOD
UM
SO U UM I HAVE UH RECEIVED SOME SOME SOME SOME WELL POINTS OF OF THINKING OVER OF MY ACCOUNT MANAGER AND UH I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THEM WITH YOU
UM
FIRST THING IS UH TELETEXT IS A WELL KNOWN FEATURE OF TELEVISIONS BUT IT'S IT'S GETTING USED LESS AND LESS
THAT'S THAT'S ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET OF COURSE
SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT UM
DO WE INCLUDE IT AND DO WE GIVE IT A PROMINENT UH PROMINENT UH PLACE ON ON ON THE ON WELL HUH
ON THE REMOTE MOT CONTROL ITSELF
UH AS UH A IN ANY CASE IT'S IT'S NOT USED WELL VERY MUCH BUT IT'S IT IS STILL USED
UM
FURTHER YES WE MUST THINK UH DO WE STAY UH TO TO TELEVISION ONLY
THE TELEVISION AS WE AS WE ALL KNOW IT WITH WITH BROADCASTING SIGNALS AND YOU CAN'T GO BACK UH-HUH
OR DO WE UH UH GO FURTHER AS MATTHEW INDICATED BY SUPPORTING UH UH RECORDING UH DEVICES
UH INDEED INDEED
AND AND AND THE HARD DISK RECORDERS
UM FURTHERMORE UH
W WE NEED REALLY NEED TO INTEREST UH Y YOUNGER CUSTOMERS AND THEN WITH YOUNGER CUSTOMERS I MEAN PEOPLE UH BELOW THE AGE OF FORTY
AND OUR OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE MAINLY FORTY PLUS UH WHICH WELL FORTY
SO THAT'S TO THAT'S I MEAN THERE'S A MARKET BUT UH THEY WILL GROW OLDER OLDER AND YOU'LL AL ALWAYS NEED TO HAVE THE THE FUTURE WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE
UM THEREFORE
YOUNGER PEOPLE LIKE TRENDY TRENDY DESIGNS SO THAT'S W WE SHOULD
MAKE OUR OUR OUR R. C. AS TRENDY AS POSSIBLE BUT
IT SHOULD ALSO BE UH HAVE A RELIABLE IMAGE SO WHEN IT LOOKS TOO TOO SPACEY OR TOO FANCY PEOPLE WILL THINK WELL DOES IT WORK AT ALL
HMM
MA MAYBE MAYBE YOU CAN DRAW IT ON THE ON THE BOARD UH
HMM
YES YES MO
YES IT'S RECOGNISABLE
MM MM
AND AND THEY ARE SKILLED UH BY USING IT
MAEL CAN YOU HAND ME OVER THIS UH
UH THANK YOU
MM WELL I THINK FI FIVE MIN MM-HMM
OKAY
'KAY I I THINK NOW THAT THE IDEA'S CLEAR
UH WE SHOULD NOW UH TRY TO DECIDE UM ON OUR TARGET GROUP
OF COURSE THEY HAVE ALREADY ONE
SO OUR OUR OUR REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE BETTER
MM-HMM
MM
I WELL I THINK MANY PEOPLE SAID UH IN YOUR IN IN YOUR RESEARCH UH UH
UH THE APPEARANCE OF THE UH R. C. IS IS IMPORTANT WHEN THEY ARE BUYING ONE BUT
INDEED
SO THAT WILL BE ABOUT
FUNCTIONALITY
MM
MM-HMM
MM
SO YOUR YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR A MORE U UNIVERSAL HIGH PERFORMANCE
WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT COMPONEN
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S NECESSARY
IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
I THINK THI THIS COULD BE THIS COULD BE A MARKET BECAUSE UH UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROLS UH TEND TO BE UH QUITE EXPENSIVE
S SO WE CAN TRY TO GO IN BETWEEN AND OFFER A PRODUCT WHICH IS NOT AS EXPENSIVE AND NOT AS
COMPLICATED
BUT BUT STILL BUT STILL PEOPLE HAVE THE IDEA THIS IS MORE FUNCTIONAL THAN A NORMAL UH UH
R. C. BECAUSE IT HAS MORE UH IT IT IS IN SOME KIND UNIVERSAL
MM YES BUT W WE'RE TARGETING I THINK ON MORE ON THE ON THE TWENTY TO FORTY GROUP
PEOPLE YES
WHO JUST HAVE OR ALREADY HAVE A JOB AND HAVE THE MONEY BUT
MAY NOT WANT TO SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY ON A ON A UNIVERSAL UNIVERSAL CONTROL
UH WELL
I THINK UH WHEN WE THINK IT OVER I THI I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO OFFER THE A KIND OF UNIVERSAL CONTROL FOR FOR LESS MONEY
SO D DO YOU AGREE
MM-HMM
YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE TWELVE EURO FIFTY
OKAY
UM SO
THEN WE WE DECIDE ON ON ON GOING TO THIS MORE UNIVERSAL KIND OF CONTROL
MM
MM
OKAY
YES
MM MM MM MM
SO GIVEN WE ARE GOING FOR THIS UH
UH UNIVERSAL TYPE UH M MAYBE IT IS GOOD WHEN YOU TRY TO FIND OUT WHICH COMPONENTS YOU THEREFORE NEED AND Y YOU WILL TRY TO GET MORE SPECIFIC UH USER INTERFACE CONTENT AND UH MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK ON ON WHAT TRENDS ARE IN THIS UH IN THIS TYPE OF MARKET
SO ANYONE UH HAS A POINT TO BRING IN OR SHALL WE NO
OKAY
W YES WE UH WE CAN HAVE LUNCH NOW
SO UM
THEN TH
TH THE NEXT MEETING WILL UH AFTER LUNCH YOU HAVE UH WE HAVE
UH THIRTY MINUTES OF WORK AND THEN WE HAVE THE NEXT MEETING
BUT YOU WILL BE INFORMED VIA THE COMPUTER
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
NEXT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE
OKAY
YOU CAN DISCONNECT IT THERE NO
THEN YOU CAN CONNECT THIS ONE OR THIS ONE YEAH
ALL TO YOUR COMPUTER
OH YEAH
OKAY
HMM
YEAH
WELL IT WOULD BE F
NO YOU CAN'T
OH
WELL IT DEPENDS YOU KNOW LIKE
THERE IS UH IT'S A VERY SMALL VOCABULARY THAT YOU WANT TO DO THE OPERATIONS LIKE YOU WANT TO SAY ON OFF
ONE TWO
TWENTY THREE YEAH
IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE LI IT'S NOT GOING TO BE S SO EASY BUT
U USUALLY IT'S GOING TO BE MORE OF AN ISOLATED
CASE BUT IT'S BUT I DON'T KNOW WITH TWENTY FI
OKAY IT'S UH DECLINE
OKAY
OKAY
NOW YOU CAN MOVE I THINK YEAH
IT'S A CHANNEL SELECTION A MODULE THIS AND THIS FUNCTION GO TO THE
YEAH
BUT IS IT UH CAN YOU JUST BUY IT ON THE MARKET AND F PLUG IT IN OR YOU WANT TO MA
WELL IT TO DU IT'S JUST YOU HAD TO CHANGE THE FREQUENCIES
YEAH
BUT YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL PEOPLE ARE SOMETIME BECOMING PROBLEM
LIKE A GUY HAS RECENTLY DESIGNED A REMOTE UH UH UH WHICH COULD SWITCH OFF ANY OTHER T. V. S SO BASICALLY THROUGH ALL THE THINGS
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK OF YEAH
YEAH SO YOU CAN JUST GO ON THE STREET AND THEN SWITCH OFF EVERYONE'S T. V. AND YOU CAN JUST WALK AWAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NEAR THE T. V. AT ALL
YEAH SO
OKAY
SO I CAN TAKE I THINK MINE NOW THERE
OKAY SO VOILA
HMM I CAN TAKE MINE IT'S OKAY VOILA MM SO MM
OKAY
IT'S ON THE DESKTOP
TECHNICAL FUNCTION
OKAY
LIKE SO
WELL
SO UM I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION SO WHA WHAT ACTUALLY IT'S ABOUT WHAT IS THE USER GOING TO DO
I THINK MY LAST PRESENTED WHAT IS GOING INSIDE SO WHAT'S THE USER IS GOING TO SEE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND HOW HE IS GOING TO USE IT
SO WELL THE APPROACH IS THAT UH
BASICALLY THE IDEA IS TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE T. V. SET AS MAEL HAS POINTED
AND IT WILL BE DECODED BY THE T. V. AND USUALLY WE IT IS EASIER TO HAVE UH KEYS OR BUTTONS WITH WHICH PEOPLE CAN UH PRESS AND THEN UM CHANGING A BUTTON WILL BASICALLY UH CHANGE THE MESSAGE WHICH IS BEING SENT TO THE T. V. AND UH UM A AND BASICALLY IT SENDS AN INTERNAL SIGNAL AND DECODED BY THE RECEIVER
SO P AS UM ANNA HAS SAID THAT THIS KI PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THINGS WHICH ARE YOU DON'T NEED TO K PRESS THE KEYS
PEOPLE ARE CAN HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT THIS IS UH S A QUESTION WHICH WILL WE HAVE TO SEE LATER
BUT IN THE PRESENT SCENARIO IS THAT YOU HAVE CERTAIN KEYS AND YOU PRESS IT LIKE YOUR MOBILE PHONE AND IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE T. V.
AND UM SO GENERALLY MM I DON'T HAVE SOME FIGURES SORRY BUT UM SO THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF UH REMOTE IF YOU POPULARLY IN THE HOUSEHOLD
ACTUALLY SO YOU HAVE A STANDARD T. V. REMOTE WHERE YOU HAVE JUST A ON OFF BUTTON AND PLAY
UH VOLUME CHANGE AND UH KEYS FOR THE NUMBER AND MORE THAN ONE DIGIT OPTION
AND IF YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE RIGH RIGHT NOW UH UH EVEN THE ONE UH ON MORE THAN ONE DIGIT OPTION IS FOR TWO DIGIT CHANNEL WHICH IS LIKE NINETY NINE
BUT TOMORROW YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE FIFTY CHANNELS YOU KNOW TO BROWSE OR TWO HUNDRED CHANNELS TO BROWSE WHO KNOWS BUT UH UH
THEN THERE IS UH THIS IS THE STANDARD ONE WITH WITHOUT ANY FANCY THING YOU KNOW LIKE I IT DOESN'T HAVE TELETEXT OPTION
IT CAN WITHOUT ANY IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING UM WHICH WHICH YOU CAN VOUCH
AND THEN YOU HAVE UH WHAT'S THE V VIDEO REMOTE FILE WHICH IS LIKE USUALLY IT HAS ALMOST ALL THE KEYS OVER THERE AND
BUT IT THEN IT HAS OTHER OPTIONS LIKE STOP UH AND THEN YOU PLAY THE MOVIE OR UH OR FO FAST FORWARD THE MOVIE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO I IT HAS THOSE SO THESE ARE THE STANDARD UH COMMONLY FOUND REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE UH MARKET
AND THEN WHI WHICH IS GENERALLY USED BY THE PEOPLE
AND THEN WELL PERSONAL PREFERENCES I WOULD UH BASICALLY THINK OF HAVING A KIND OF AIM FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THING WHERE THE WE COULD HAVE BOTH THE UH THE F A T. V. AND THE REMOTE VIDEO REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE UH SOME OF THE KEYS IN THE VIDEO'S REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. THEY COULD BE INTEGRATED TOGETHER SO THAT UH WE COULD UM AIM FOR THE LIKE IN THE F COMING FUTURE UM THAT TYPE OF UH APPLICATIONS WITH
YEAH
YEAH
UM ACTUALLY UM YOU COULD YOU COULD THINK OF UM HAVING S A Y YOU CAN HAVE A KEY WHICH COULD TELL Y IT COULD GO TO THE VIDEO THING BUT UM UH YO YOU YOU YOU STILL CAN'T UM IN THAT CASE WHEN IT YOU USE THAT THE FUNCTION SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE UP THE V. C. R. OPTION AND YOU COULD PLAY IT OR YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT HAVING LIKE UM
I IN A FEW DAYS YOU WILL BE HA IN IN FEW YE COMING YEARS YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE A SEPARATE UH SITTING SETUP BOX AND UH YOU HAVE UH UM SOMETHING LIKE UH UH YOU DO YOU DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO WATCH SOME PROGRAMME AND ACTUALLY IT DOWNLOADING ALL THE TIME FOR YOU AND UH YOU CAN JUST YOU KNOW UH WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU COULD JUST SWITCH ON THAT THING AND UH WATCH A PROGRAM
IN THAT CASE YOU WANT TO BROWSE FASTER BROWSE SLOW YOU WANT TO HAVE THOSE KIND OF FUNCTIONALITIES
IT'S THE NEXT GENERATION THING BUT IT IS GOING TO COME IN COUPLE OF YEARS
IT'S GOI
YEAH IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT'S GOING TO RECORD YOUR THINGS AND YOU AND YOU YOU NEED BASICALLY THE FUNCTIONALITIES WHAT YOU NEED IN BOTH UH UH VIDEO AS WELL AS IN THE STANDARD T. V. THING
NO NO WE ARE NOT MAKING A UNIVERSAL REMOTE WE ARE JUST LOOKING AT UH GIVING A SCENARIO
I HAVE A T. V. AND TOMORROW I AM GOING TO HAVE SET UP BOX WHICH IS GOING TO SIT THERE AND UH IT'S GOING TO DO THAT JOB FOR ME
YEAH
SO
OKAY SO THAT P ENDS MY PRESENTATION
WELL
SO WE CAN ALWAYS DISCUSS ABOUT IT FOR EXAMPLE UH THE PRESENTLY THE VIDEO MARKET ACTUALLY UH THIS DEMAND VIDEO OVER DEMAND OR WHAT WE CALL IT AS
IT'S PRESENTLY BOOMING UP ACTUALLY SO IT I LIKE PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING LIKE UH THINGS LIKE UH UH MOVIES
YOU CAN SELECT ACTUALLY SO YOU WANT TO WATCH A MOVIE AND UH YOUR P YOUR PROVIDER GIVES A LIST OF MOVIES AND THEN YOU SELECT THOSE LIST
AND IT BASICALLY YOU GO OFF IT DOWNLOADS THE MOVIE IT GIVES FOR YOU AND THEN WHEN YOU COME YOU WANT TO LOO WATCH IT ON YOUR T. V.
AND THI THIS IS GOING TO COME
YEAH IT CAN BE STREAMED ONLINE FOR YOU AND YOU CAN SAY WHAT TIME I WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE AND
YEAH SO
YEAH
YEAH
UM
YEAH IT'S UH WELL YOU YOU CAN FOLLOW THE IDEAS HOW YOU WANT TO KEEP THE KEYS
YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IF YOU TAKE IT YOU HAVE LIKE ZERO ONE TWO
THREE LIKE A KEYS SEPARATELY BUT SUPPOSE IF YOU TAKE THE THE PRESENT TREND OF MOBILE PHONES THERE ARE LIKE BIG THICK KEYS YOU PRESS ON THE TOP
IT TAKES ONE NUMBER YOU PRESS ON THE BOTTOM IT TAKES ANOTHER NUMBER
AND UH BASICALLY UH UH SO THE SPACE COVERED SO THAT YOU DON'T SEE TWO SEPARATE KEYS THERE ACTUALLY SO IT IT IS LIKE UH UM I I IT IS LIKE UH
YEAH SO
SO FOR EXAMPLE UH
WELL UH
OKAY IT WORKS
FINE
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE UH PRESENTLY UH KEYS LIKE ONE TWO
THREE LIKE THIS ACTUALLY AND UH UH FOUR FIVE SIX LIKE THAT AND UH YOU CAN HAVE KEYS LIKE THIS IN FORM LIKE
UH KEYS LIKE THAT
FORTY MINUTES
YEAH SO YOU YOU YOU CAN HAVE UH KEYS LIKE UH WHICH ARE WHICH ARE LIKE SO
TOO SORRY SO WE BASICALLY DON'T CHANGE THE UH ORIGINAL ORDER OF THEM BUT THEN THE KEYS ARE MORE SPACIOUS
THEY DON'T LOOK UH SO THERE THERE IS A VERY SLIGH THING SO IF YOU PRESS ON THE TOP IT TAKES THE ONE
IT TAKES THE THREE UH FOUR SORRY FOUR HERE UH FIVE AND SIX
SO THE KEYS CAN BE IT LOOKS YOU KNOW NOT VERY MUCH CLUTTERED BUT IT LOOKS NICE FOR YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY KEYS BUT YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS T IF YOU PRESS ON THE TO
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL
WELL I IT'S FINE WITH ME LIKE THE PRICE AS LONG AS IT IS UH NOT TOO EXPENSIVE
UH AND IT D UH
OUR PROVIN
MM
UH YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDED BASICALLY
UH THAT'S NEEDED RIGHT NOW
AND UH BASICALLY YOU CAN LOOK TO THE STANDARDS OF OTHER
ACTU
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN ALSO BROWSE THROUGH ALL THE STANDARDS YOU KNOW WHERE ARE THE LIMIT OF STANDARDS FOR ALL OF THEM AND YOU CAN JUST BROWSE THROUGH THEM
OKAY
OKAY
VOILA
HMM
SO
WELL
OH I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW
WE CAN WE'LL WE'LL GO AND WE'LL I'M SURE WE'LL UP SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE
YEAH SO WE MEET IN WELL WHAT ARE OUR
OKAY
COOL
SO SEE YOU LATER
YEP
PERFECT
SO Y YOU ARE THE SECRETARY ALSO
RIGHT
OKAY
PERFECTLY YEAH YEAH OF COURSE UH-HUH
YOU MEAN THE SOCIAL TARGET GROUP WHO WE WANTS TO TARGET
OH THE CUSTOMERS OKAY
IT'S IT'S EASY TO LEARN OR HOW DO YOU SAY IT'S
OKAY TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN
OKAY
NOT ENOUGH
MAYBE Y Y YOU CANNOT PUT THIS WEBPAGE ONLINE ON THE
AH IT'S IT OKAY IT'S A WEBPAGE ON THE C. IT'S A FILE OKAY
O OTHERWISE YOU YEAH
YOU CAN CONNECT THIS ONE
YEAH
SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT NUMBERS THAT MATTHEW AND I NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FOR OUR FUNCTIONAL UM
YEAH
YEAH THESE NUMBERS HAVE HAVE TO BE HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
FOR THE UH BOTH YEAH USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
BECAUSE IF THERE ARE MANY NUMBERS AND WE NEED TO SELECT TO TO CONSTRAINT UH OUR DESIGN BASED ON WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT
SPEECH RECOGNITION IN
AH OKAY
SO THAT WE DON'T DO WE NOT NEED ANY BUTTON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IT WOULD BE ALL BASED ON SPEECH
OKAY
INTERESTING IDEA
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE STATE OF THE ART OF SPEECH RECOGNITION IS MAYBE YOU KNOW
BUT IT'S QUITE NOISY IF THERE IS THE T. V. UH SHOUTING
OKAY
SO YOU HAD TO TO TO SUMMARISE MAYBE THE
MM
MM-HMM
I THI YOU US YEAH YEAH
OKAY PERFECT
MM 'KAY
YEAH
MM I OKAY I STAY
I CAN MOVE AS FAR AS
MAYBE I TAKE YOUR CHAIR
I OKAY
SO I THINK AS EVERYBODY KNOWS UH I'M THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
AND UH IN THIS PRESENTATION UH THIS GROUP PRESENTATION UM IS GONNA FOCUS ON THE WORKING DESIGN OF THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM I'D LIKE FIRST TO GIVE A QUICK A VERY SIMPLE INTRODUCTION HOW DOES IT WORK
SO THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A VERY UH TECHNICAL BACKGROUND UH WHAT IS IT BECAUSE I THINK IN THE PRODUCT IT IS IMPORTANT
SO BASICALLY UM THE BASIC FUNCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SEND UH MESSAGES TO ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT IS FIXED
AND SO AN ENERGY SOURCE FEEDS AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT THE CHIP THAT CAN COMPOSE MESSAGES
USUALLY UH THROUGH A UM INFRARED BIT AND UH THE USER INTERFACE CONTROLS THE CHIP AND ACCORDINGLY THE THE MESSAGES ALRIGHT
SO MY METHOD FOR UM DESIGNING THE YEAH THE WORK DESIGN UH YEAH FIRST THE THE MAIN POINT IS THAT I WOULD WISH TO TO MAKE A REALLY FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT
I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE VERY FUNCTIONAL UM CAPABILITIES RATHER THAN FANCY STUFF THAT IN FACT IS NOT USED AND DOESN'T WORK
SO FOR THAT YEAH AS IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE USER REQUIREMENTS FROM THE MARKETING UH EXPERT UH ANNA AND UM
W TO TO WE SHOULD AGREE ON WHAT ARE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS UH FOR THIS REMOTE CONTROL AND I SHOW YOU THE THE WORKING DESIGN
SO UM BASICALLY UH HERE IS A REALLY LARGE VIEW OF WHAT WE WANT
UH WE WANT AN ON OFF BUTTON IT CAN BE UH IT'S SIMPLE BUT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT
AND ALSO UH THE TO BOTH CHANNELS AS WELL AS OTHER BUTTONS THAT COME AFTER RIGHT
SO THE COMPONENTS I QUICKLY DRAW HERE
IS THAT IN THIS PART YOU HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL THE THE SENDER AND ON THE OTHER PART THE RECEIVER SO THAT'S MY METHOD IS UM WILL BE TO WELL MY AIM WOULD BE TO UH DESIGN THE AND CHOOSE THE CHIPS AND THE INFRARED UM COMPONENTS TO BUILD THE REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT
SO OF COURSE WE NEED ENERGY SOURCES AND UH UH THE RECEIVER A A RECEIVER
THIS IS VERY QUICK UH DESIGN UH YOU STOP ME OR INTERRUPT ME IF UH YOU DON'T AGREE ON IT ON THAT
AND UM SO WHAT I HAVE FOUND AND AFTER A LOT OF WORK ACTUALLY I I DRAW THIS I DRAW FOR YOU THIS UH SCHEMA THAT CAN BE MAYBE TOO TECHNICAL FOR YOU BUT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME YOU KNOW
AND UH THAT'S IT SO I WON'T GO INTO DETAILS ABOUT THAT BUT UH THESE ARE MY PREFERENCES TO USE UH THAT KIND OF COMPONENTS
SO
SO THE THE MAIN COMPONENTS YOU SEE HERE ARE THE CHEAPEST I HAVE FOUND AND
YEAH TH YOU HAVE ALWAYS A COMPROMISE WITH UH RELIABILITY AND UH I IF IT'S EXPENSIVE
BUT UH THIS ONE WAS NOT THIS ONE ALSO REALLY UH RELIABLE UM SO
YEAH THAT'S IT FOR THE WORKING DESIGN
UH I HOPE YOU GET CLEARER VIEW ON UH WHAT WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL IS UH IN TERMS OF UH TECHNICAL COMPONENTS BUT MAYBE YEAH
NO NO NO NO WE WE WILL UH THIS IS A PREFERENCE BUT WE CAN ALWAYS CHANGE UH
YEAH
OF COURSE YEAH
YEAH
WE WILL USE UH INFRARED PROTOCOL UH USING YEAH INFRARED AND UH
AND OF COURSE WE NEED TO ADAPT TO THAT PROTOCOL THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND BUT WE WHAT WE CAN DO IS UH UH ADAPTING THE THE CHIPS INSIDE UH TO THE BEST UH CHIPS AND UH INFRARED BUBBLES
UM
OKAY
THE FREQUENCIES
YEAH YEAH
OF COURSE YEAH IN THE CHIP YOU HAVE IT YEAH
THAT CAN CONTROL O OTHER THINGS
YEAH
OF COURSE YEAH WE SHOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN THE UH
YES
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEP
THESE ARE KIND OF NEXT GENERATION FUNCTIONALITIES
MM 'KAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
OR EVEN YOU DON'T NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT IT'S STREAMED UH ONLINE UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
FOURTEEN OR FOR O OKAY
SO
MM-HMM
YEAH
BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY USED TO THAT YOU KNOW PRODUCT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YES
MM-HMM
YEP
YEAH WE HAVE YEAH TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS UH PER UH PER R. S R. C. AND I THINK UH WITH THIS NOW YOU KNOW THAT CHIPS ARE VERY UH CHEAPS AND UH WE CAN INCLUDE IT IN OUR CONTROL SOME NEW NEW FEATURES
YEAH
AND UM BUT YEAH THAT'S
YE
I DON'T THINK L. C. D. IS NOT NECESSARY WELL TH FOR LONG TERM
YEAH
UNIVERSAL
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE ARE GONNA B WE ARE GONNA SELL UH FOUR ARO AROUND FOUR MILLION SO WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT THESE NUMBERS UH THE PRICE OF A CHIP IS UH PRICE OF A CHIP IS VERY CHEAP
SO I'M OKAY FOR DESIGNING UM A NE UH LESS YEAH A A KIND OF UNIVERSAL UH R. C. YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S NEEDED YEAH
AND IF WE WANT TO GET THE MARKET WE REALLY NEED THAT
YES
EXACTLY
IS THAT OKAY FOR YOU
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YES
OH THAT'S THAT'S FINE THEN
YEAH
OKAY PERFECT
RIGHT FIRST TIME THIS TIME
NU
THERE WE GO
IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED BUT I GET IT WRONG EVERY TIME
FOR MATTHEW YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEP
MM-HMM
I HAVE A PRESENTATION I'M JUST MAKING THIS
OKAY I'LL JUST EMAIL YOU THIS FILE MY PRESENTATION
MM-HMM I'M JUST EMAILING IT TO YOU
OKAY IT SHOULD'VE GONE THROUGH TO YOU
MM-HMM
OKAY SO THIS IS JUST A PRESENTATION ON UH THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE GONNA USE TO MAKE THE PRODUCT STAND OUT FROM THE REST OF THE PRODUCTS OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT
UM CAN I JUST PUT THIS ON
SO WE HAVE TO WORK OUT A WAY WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR PRODUCT TO MAKE IT STAND OUT AND MAKE IT SO PEOPLE WANNA BUY IT
UM
THIS IS TO DO THIS I WILL NOT REMOVE MY MICROPHONE
WE BASICALLY USED UM SOME FOCUS GROUP SURVEYS WHICH I WENT THROUGH WITH YOU LAST TIME THE MAIN RESULTS OF THAT
AND UM SOME RESEARCH ON THE CURRENT DESIGN UM AND FASHION TRENDS THAT ARE OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT UM AND AS PART OF THIS
THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS THAT CAME OUT WERE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED REALLY
THE MOST IMPORTANT BY FAR WAS THE LOOK AND FEEL OF IT
IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE OUT THERE
IT NEEDS TO STAND OUT
IT NEEDS TO BE NOT FUNCTIONAL LIKE THE REST OF THE THINGS OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT
MOST PEOPLE FIND REMOTE CONTROLS BORING AT THE MOMENT WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS INTERESTING THAT LOOKS EXCITING THAT WILL STAND OUT
PEOPLE WILL WANNA BUY IT
UM
THAT WAS TWICE AS I IMPORTANT AS THE NEXT ITEM ON HERE WHICH IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE HAS TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
APART FROM JUST THE LOOK OF IT
PEOPLE HAVE TO THEN THINK ABOUT IT AND SAY GOT SOMETHING THERE THAT I WANT
THAT'S A REALLY COOL FEATURE AND IT HAS TO MAKE THEM WANNA BUY IT AGAIN
THIRD ON THE LIST AND AGAIN INNOVATIVE WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THIS LAST UM ASPECT IT HAS TO BE EASY TO USE
SO THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT AND HAVE SOME INTUITIVE IDEA OF HOW TO USE IT UM
DRAWING ON THE FASHION TRENDS AT THE MOMENT UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES UM
THIS IS BASICALLY TALKING ABOUT JUST THE THE FEEL OF IT SO PROBABLY NOT THE SMELL OF IT BUT THE BRIGHT COLOURS
UM EYE CATCHING REALLY BOLD DESIGNS AND A SPONGY FEEL
UM I HAD A TALK TO THE DESIGN PEOPLE ABOUT THIS BUT HAVING A REMOTE THAT'S TACTILE THAT FEELS DIFFERENT THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL
THAT WOULD MAKE IT STAND OUT
UM
WELL MA MAKE IT NOT NECESSAR SP SPONGY IS THE CURRENT THING
SPONGY IS THE CURRENT TEXTURE BUT BASICALLY THERE ARE NO REPORTS NO REMOTES AT THE MOMENT WHICH ARE SPONGY OR TACTILE AT ALL
SO IF WE MAKE IT LIKE MAYBE FURRY OR SOFT OR SOMETHING
THAT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT SETS IT APART RATHER THAN JUST BARE PLASTIC WHICH THEY ALL ARE AT THE MOMENT
SO AS FAR AS THE DESIGN GOES THE VERY MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT WAS THE DESIGN TO THE CUSTOMERS
SO GOING WITH THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE IDEA WE'VE GOT THE BRIGHT COLOURS SO MAKES IT STAND OUT
THE ORANGES AND THE THE BRIGHT YELLOWS AND THE FLORESCENT COLOURS PART OF THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES UM
GOING BACK TO THE IDEA OF TAKING INSPIRATION FROM MOBILE PHONES
THEY'VE ALL GOT THOSE A LOT OF THEM HAVE THE CHANGEABLE COVERS SO THEY CAN CHOOSE WHAT COLOUR THE OUTSIDE IS
THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT UM
TEXTURED FEEL WE JUST TALKED ABOUT
MAYBE IT'S ANOTHER WAY OF DOING THAT
SO IF IT'S PART OF THE THE CHANGEABLE COVERS THEN MAY MAYBE THEY CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT TEXTURE A SPONGY ONE OR A SOFT ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO THEY CAN CHOOSE IT LI AS THEY WANT TO TO MAYBE TO FIT IN WITH THEIR DECOR IN THEIR LIVING ROOM
OR JUST WHAT THEY LIKE THEIR SPORTS TEAM OR WHATEVER
UM AND YEAH STILL TAKING THE INSPIRATION FROM THE MOBILE PHONE DESIGN SO
FUNCTIONALITY THE WAY THE MOBILE PHONES WORK THE WAY THE KEYPAD LOOKS
ALSO JUST THE WAY THAT A LOT OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS GOING INTO MOBILE PHONES AT THE MOMENT
THEY'RE BIG SELLING ITEMS
PEOPLE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THAT SO WE CAN LEVERAGE OFF THAT AND WE CAN START USING SOME OF THEIR IDEAS
UM BACK TO TECHNOLOGICAL IN IN INNOVATION NOT QUITE AS IMPORTANT BUT STILL A BIG ISSUE
UM WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING A WAY OF FINDING A REMOTE CONTROL IF IT'S BEEN LOST UH THAT'S ONE THING WE COULD LOOK AT
THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS LIKE L. C. D. SCREENS AND SPEECH RECOGNITION WHICH WEREN'T
I DON'T THINK IN MY PERSONAL OPINION GONNA BE WORTH THE EXTRA EXPENSE AND THE EXTRA EFFORT THAT WILL GO INTO THEM
I THINK WE'RE BETTER DOING SOMETHING BASIC LIKE THIS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY WILL BE A REALLY COOL FEATURE TO PUT IN
AND
USE
I HAD NO REAL SPECIFIC IDEAS FOR THIS MAYBE WE JUST THE BASIC IDEA OF HAVING YOUR CORE FUNCTIONS BIG AND AT THE TOP MAYBE
BY THEMSELVES AND THEN YEAH AND THEN TH TH THE FINER DETAILS OF BUTTONS YOU DON'T USE AS MUCH EITHER HIDDEN AWAY OR COMPLETELY SEPARATE
YEP AND THAT'S THE PRESENTATION
SO DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR IDEAS ON THAT
I THINK YOU
HMM
WELL WE'RE SELLING SO MANY UNITS OF THIS
THIS IS GONNA BE A MASS MARKETED PRODUCT WE CAN AFFORD TO HAVE TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT DESIGNS AT LEAST
MM MM
MM
MM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM
I LIKE THE IDEA THOUGH OF HAVING SPEECH RECOGNITION FOR LIKE THE N THE NAME OF A CHANNEL LIKE B. B. C.
RATHER THAN HAVING TO REMEMBER THE THE NUMBER OF IT ON THE KEYPAD
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM
HMM
MM
YEAH I REALLY LIKE THAT IDEA
MM-HMM
MM
MAYBE TEN CHANNELS YEAH AT THE MOST
MM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM-HMM
MM B
BUT A COFFEE MACHINE THERE'S NOT TOO MANY WORDS THEY'D BE USING WITH THAT IT'S A IT'S A SMALL VOCABULARY
MM
MM
MM
MM
TWO THIRTY FIVE SUPPOSED TO FINISH
HMM
HMM
MM
YEAH
MM
I THINK YOU CAN DO IT BOTH WAYS
YOU CAN HAVE IT SO IT'S EASY THEY CAN PICK IT UP AND USE IT STRAIGHT AWAY WITHOUT DOING ANYTHI WITHOUT CUSTOMIZING IT
OR IF THEY WANT TO THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF USING THESE EXTRA FEATURES
HMM
HMM
HMM
MM
HMM
MM
HMM
MM
HMM
I LIKE THE IDEA TOO OF BEING ABLE TO USE THE REMOTE IN THE DARK
SO EITHER HAVING THE BUTTONS SO YOU CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM OR IF THEY IF THEY LIGHT UP OR SOMETHING
MM
MM
HMM
MM
HMM
MM
MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM JUST HAVE A YEAH
JUST THE VENEER ON IT YEAH
HMM
MM
MM-HMM
WELL MAYBE WE NEED SPECIFIC COSTINGS THEN
ACTUALLY DO MAYBE TWO DESIGNS AND THEN COST THEM OUT AND SEE WHICH ONE IS GONNA FIT IN OUR BUDGET BETTER
MM
MM
HMM
MM YEAH SURE
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM
SO IS THERE ANY OF THESE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT PARTICULARLY OR IS THIS JUST IDEAS
MM-HMM
HMM
MM
MM
MM YEAH
YOU SEE
YEAH
MM WELL ONE I'VE HAD BEFORE
A R R REMOTE CONTROL WE HAVE AT HOME IS ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY GOT A COVER ON THE BOTTOM SO THE BOTTOM BIT IS JUST
COVERS HALF THE KEYS MOST OF THE TIME AND THEN YOU CAN SLIDE THE COVER BACK TO GET TO THE THE MORE ADVANCED KEYS
MM
MM
YEAH
UM YEAH I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE TOO
ANOTH ANOTHER LIKE B IT FLIPS UP AND THEN YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER LAYER OF BUTTONS UNDERNEATH
MM
BUT I'VE SEEN ALSO WITH KEYS AND BUTTONS ON THE TOP OF HERE AS WELL
I LIKE THIS ONE
I LIKE THE SHAPE OF THIS ONE
CAN WE HAVE CAN WE THINK ABOUT MAYBE HAVING A A NON RECTA NON NON RECTANGULAR ONE SO WITH NOT JUST THE STRAIGHT LITTLE BOX THAT'S A MAYBE CURVED OR SOMETHING
MM MM 'KAY
IS THIS FOR THE NEXT MEETING THOUGH
I THINK WE MIGHT BE OUT OF TIME OUT OF TIME FOR THIS MEETING
YEP
NO
SO IS THIS IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO DO FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW FOR THE NEXT MEETING
MM
OKAY WELL IS THIS ME DESIGNING A WAY TO EVALUATE IT SO
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO SET UP TEST GROUPS AND THINGS
MM
OKAY
YEP
MM
HMM
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
THANKS GUYS
MM
UH
SO I SUGGEST WE START THE MEETING UH WITHOUT MATTHEW UH HE'S UH OBVIOUSLY LATE FOR SOME REASON
GOOD
UM
TODAY UH WE WILL UH TALK ABOUT UH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
I HOPE UH YOU BOTH DID SOME UH SOME WORK UH
CONCERNING A UH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
UM THIS WILL BE THE UH AGENDA FOR
THE MEETING UH
UH I WILL
TAKE SOME MINUTES UH AGAIN
UM WE WILL HAVE THE PRESENTATIONS OF Y OF YOU DIFFERENT TEAM MEMBERS AND THEN TRY TO COME TO DECISIONS UH ABOUT THE CONCEPTS UH YOU HAVE PRESENTED
SO AND THAT UH WILL UH WE HAVE SOME UH FORTY MINUTES UH TO COMPLETE THIS UH
SO UM WHO HAS THE FIR DO YOU HA ANNA DO YOU HAVE YOUR PRESENTATION READY
OKAY
AH THERE IS MATTHEW
SO
GOOD
DO PRESENTATION READY
OH OKAY
SO DID YOU MANAGE UH
OH YES I SEE HIM GOOD YES
NO
OKAY MM YES I HAVE IT
MM
MM
HMM
SPONGY FEEL
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
YES WELL MAYBE MATTHEW CAN CAN GIVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THE
MM
OKAY GOOD THAT'S VERY CLEAR
'KAY
UM
UH
MAYBE WE YES WELL WE MAYBE CAN DECIDE LATER ON UM THE L THE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF UH I'VE IT WAS A GOOD IDEA MAYBE TO TO
YES THE THE THE THERE ARE CHANGEABLE COVERS
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MY SUPERIORS WOULD BE SO GLAD WITH IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO INTRODUCE A COMPLETE UH UH NEW L LINE OF UH OF SUPPLIES UH IT WOULD BE UH VERY COMPLICATED UH ORGANISATIONAL
HMM
MM-HMM
YES
MM-HMM
YES AND OF COURSE IT WILL BE A WE WE GET A IF IT WORKS WE CAN GET UH AFTER SALES I MEAN THAT WOULD WOULD BE VERY GOOD I MEAN THOSE COVERS COULD GO FOR FOR THREE
FIVE EURO
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA UM
AND THEN UH
MAYBE UH WE CAN GO A TH MATTHEW'S PRESENTATION BECAUSE
THE
TOGETHER INDEED UH BECAUSE YOU MA MIGHT HAVE SOME SOME INFORMATION ON THE THE EASY TO USE WHAT YOU WERE ALREADY MENTIONING
UM YES BUT BUT I DO MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE A HAND TO US BECAUSE I I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THAT THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT FOR TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS
I'M SORRY TO HAVE
EVERY TIME I HAVE TO COME DOWN ON THIS PRICE AGAIN TO SO THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE LIMITING FOR YOUR CREATIVITY BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S THE REAL
WE HAVE TO CONSIDER IT
S SO DO WE THINK THESE IDEAS AN AND MY UH SP SPEECH RECOGNITION
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE FOR FOR TWELVE EURO BUT THEN THEN IT WILL BE AT COST OF OTHER FUNCTIONALITY WE MIGHT IMPLEMENT LIKE THE UH UH THE THE THE FURRY UH UH CASE OF THE
MM
MM MM
HMM
HMM
MM
'KAY GOOD
MM YES UM I WOULD
YES YES YOU CAN YOU CAN STILL
WE HAVE TIME
NICE
MM-HMM
WELL WELL M M MAYBE M MAYBE WE CAN GIVE THE UH THE UH THE CASE A VERY UH UH NORMAL A V VERY NORMAL CASE BUT
WITH THE CHANGEABLE COVERS TO FANCY IT UP
SO LIKE A NORMAL CHEAP PLASTIC CASE WHICH CAN BE COVERED UP IN FOR INSTANCE A WOODEN CASE
I MEAN JUST WHAT
MM-HMM
MM
NO OF COURSE
SO
SO I F I THINK WE WE SHOULD COME TO SOME DECISIONS NOW UH A ABOUT THIS
UM SO I UNDERSTAND UH WHEN WE WANT A DISPLAY WE NEED A EXPENSIVE CHIP
BUT WHEN WE WANT A SCROLLING WHEEL W WE ALSO NEED THE EXPENSIVE CHIP SO CAN WE USE SAME CHIP SO WITH ONE EXPENSIVE CHIP
WE CAN UH IMPLEMENT SEVERAL COMPLICATED UH OR ADVANCED FEATURES
YES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO WHEN THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP YOU MENTIONED THERE IS IS POSSIBLE IN THE IN THE GIVEN BUDGET UH MAYBE WE SHOULD GO FOR FOR THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP
SO ALL FEATURES UH WHICH YOU MENTIONED CAN BE IMPLEMENTED BASED ON THE SAME CHIP
DO YOU THINK THAT'S FEASIBLE
UH
YOU TH YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
HMM
MM YES WH WHEN YOU MAKE A A DESIGN CA YOU CAN NEXT MEETING YOU CAN GIVE AN QUITE AN EXACT COST PRICE
THAT W THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA
MM
GOOD GOOD
YES BUT I CAN I THINK UH I THINK WE CAN JUST USE MORE CHEAP PLASTIC FOR A KIND OF BASIC EDITION
AND THEN PEOPLE CAN FANCY IT UP WITH WITH MORE EXPENSIVE MATERIALS WHICH WHICH COME WITH A WITH ANOTHER PRICE
DO DO YOU AGREE
MA I I THINK UH FOR NEXT MEETING WE C YOU TWO CAN PRESENT A REAL DESIGN
UH SO DRAWING IT ON THE BOARD
AND THEN WE NOW SH ONLY HAVE TO T TO DECIDE THE GENERAL FUNCTION UH
SO UM
LET LET'S SAY NEXT MEETING W YOU PRODUCE TWO DESIGNS ONE ONE
ONE LESS ADVANCED AND ONE MORE ADVANCED AND WITH THE COST PRICE
UH FURTHERMORE WE GO FOR THE FOR THE UH BASIC PLASTIC CASE WHICH CAN BE LATER UH FANCIED UP WITH UH
WITH ADDIT UH ADDITIONAL UH HOW DO YOU CALL THEM THESE LIKE LIKE MOBILE TELEPHONES YOU CAN PUT A COVER OVER IT
BUT THAT THAT THAT THAT CAN BE DONE LATER
WE NOW CAN CONCENTRATE ON THE ON THE BASIC REMOTE CONTROL
UM
MM
MM-HMM
YES YES YES BI BIG KEYS IS IS GOOD THING I THINK
NO NO
MM MM MM
MM W BUT THEN YOU HAVE STILL HAVE UH WHEN YOU DON'T USE IT YOU HAVE SUCH A A AN EXTENT OF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WHICH YOU DON'T USE
SO MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE UH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN CAN INDICATE THIS
THAT YOU CAN ELSEWHERE OPEN YOUR REMOTE CONTROL AND ON THE INSIDE ARE UH BUTTONS YOU DON'T USE THAT MUCH
YES
YES I I TH THAT'S WHAT I MEAN SO I MEAN SOMETHING
LIKE LIKE A BOOK
MM
JU JUST MAKE TWO DESIGNS
AND THE WE WE CAN DECIDE DECIDE BETWEEN TH THOSE DESIGNS
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
SO ANYONE UH ANY QUESTIONS FOR NOW
UM YES I COME TO THAT UH UH
YES WELL M MAYBE UH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S POSSIBLE MAYBE YOU CAN START EVALUATING UH THEIR WORK SOMEHOW
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S POSSIBLE UH IN THE GIVEN TIME BUT A AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
SO UH YOU TWO WILL BE TOGETHER W WORKING ON A O ON TWO PROTOTYPES
AND FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE UH WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY UH BY EMAIL
TWO
I
MM AND THEN
HMM
YES OKAY
OKAY LET'S CALL THIS TO AN END
SORRY
SO
YEAH I SENT YOU THE SLIDES YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM
OKAY
SO
'KAY
YOU CAN
YEAH
VOILA
YEAH
YEAH S THEN WE COULD DISCUSS LATER LIKE WE CAN PUT ALL IDEAS TOGETHER
IT SHOULD BE EASIER WITH THAT
YEAH
SO
YEAH
YEAH SO I'LL I'LL GO WITH THAT ACTUALLY SO UM
OKAY SO M SO THEN THE THE IDEA OF UH HAVING A REMOTE IS GENERALLY YOU HAVE UH DIFFERENT KEYS AND UH DIFFERENT STRUCTURES DIFFERENT FORMS
AND UH THEY COULD BE LIKE BUTTONS OR LIKE AND UM THEY COULD BE OF UH A VARYING SIZES IF YOU WANT TO TO UH BASICALLY EMPHASIZE A PARTICULAR KEY MORE THAN THE OTHER
AND UH MAYBE LIKE YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS FOR EXAMPLE HAVING THE R RED FOR THE ON OFF SWITCHING ON AND OFF THE BUTTON
SO THIS THIS IS THE GENERAL TREND TO HA THE METHOD THEY DO
SO WHAT I HAVE FOUND WAS THAT UH CURRENTLY UH THE THEY ARE MOSTLY THAT THE T. V.
V. C. R. MUSIC SYSTEM OPERATED ONES ACTUALLY AND THEY ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO EACH OTHER
BUT THERE ARE SOME COMMON KEYS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE V. C. R. AND IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE UH G UH S SOME UH SOUNDTRACK ON THE W W SEE THEY HAVE THE COMMON THING ACTUALLY YOU CAN HAVE AND UH
THERE IS ALSO UM A SPEECH RECOGNITION TO STORE CHANNEL INFORMATION NAMES LIKE YOU CAN BASICALLY IF YOU HAVE A MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITY SAY T. V.
V. C. R. OR SOMETHING I SAY IT TO THE T. V. AND THE T. V.
AND YOU CAN PROGRAMME THE KEYS IF YOU WANT TO CERTAIN KEYS ARE EVEN THE CHANNEL INFORMATION
YEAH YEAH SO YOU YOU YOU CAN JUST UH BECAUSE UH AS MORE AND MORE CHANNELS COME THEN YOU HAVE MORE AND MORE PROBLEMS TO REMEMBER THE V V EXACT CHANNEL NUMBERS EX EXACTLY
EVEN IF YOU ARRANGE IT BY HOWEVER YOU ARRANGE IT YOU STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM TO REMEMBER EXACTLY WHICH CHANNEL YOU WANT TO
SO IT IT IT'S LIKE IT LIMITED ONE
IN THE PRESENT MARKET I SAW IT THAT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THEY ARE LOOKING FOR EIGHTY WORD THING
EIGHTY WORD WHICH SHOULDN'T BE TH THAT DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT LIKE EIGHTY TO HUNDRED WORD
BASICALLY YOU WANT YOU DON'T WANT TO STORE ALL THE CHANNELS IN THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU WANT TO ST STORE YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL
YEAH SOME TEN TWELVE CHANNEL INFORMATION
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO ST STORE ALL THE HUNDRED CHANNEL INFORMATION INTO THAT
AND UH BASICALLY UH IT DEPENDS LIKE THE REMOTE WITH L. C. D. DISPLAY FOR BROWSING BECAUSE YOU HAVE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITIES FOR EXAMPLE YOU ARE WATCHING A MOVIE
AND UH UH YOU ARE HAVING A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL AND YOU WANT TO UH YOU DON'T KNOW REALLY WHICH FUNCTIONALITY IS NOW
SO I AM USING THE T. V. SO
EVERY TIME I USE IT IT COULD BE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I CAN USE A SIMPLE TOGGLE SWITCH
AND A DISPLAY SO I PRESS IT SO THE DISPLAY SAYS OKAY I'M IN T. V. OR D. V. D. OR WHATEVER IT IS
INSTEAD OF HAVING THREE KEYS SEPARATELY FOR FOUR KEYS TO MODEL THE FUNCTIONALITIES WILL INCREASE ACTUALLY
AND FOR YOU AND YOU MIGHT WANT YOU DON'T WANT SEPARATE KEYS FOR ALL OF THEM
YOU CAN'T
AND UH WELL THERE CAN BE CHILDREN FRIENDLY WHERE YOU CAN PROGRAMME YOUR REMOTE SO THAT THEY THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED UH TO BROWSE CERTAIN CHANNELS WHICH YOU CAN BLOCK THEM
AND YOU CAN OPERATE THEM
SO THESE ARE THE THINGS PRESENTLY WHICH ARE SEEN IN THE MARKET SCENARIOS AT PRESENT
I PERSONALLY WOULD LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HAVING A U UNIVERSAL REMOTE IS UH UM IS A GOOD IDEA
LIKE INSTEAD OF HAVING UNUSUAL ONES FOR ALL OF THEM YOU CAN THINK OF HAVING UM WITH MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITY POSSIBLY WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION
I GOT A MAIL FROM THE THE COFFEE MACHINE INTERFACE UNIT THAT UH THEY HAVE UH INTEGRATED THE S SPEECH RECOGNITION INTO A INTO THE COFFEE MACHINE
AND SO IF YOU SAY HELLO COFFEE MACHINE IT SAY HI JOE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AND UH
YEAH YOU YOU WON'T BE USING IT SO IT'S A LIMITED VOCABULARY MM THING AND VERY ISOLATED WORD AND IT'S UH IT IS INTERESTING
AND BASICALLY STORING THE CHANNEL THROUGH VOICE OR OTHER WAYS OF PROGRAMMING YOUR KEYS
ON THE DISPLAY FOR THE BROWSING WHICH IS AGAIN AND MAYBE HAVING SOMETHING LIKE A BLINKING THING
LIKE UH IT COULD INDICATE YOU'RE UH IT IT COULD INDICATE WHAT IS CAL LIKE THE UH WHETHER UH YOU YOU HAVE ENOUGH BATTERY IN YOUR IN YOUR UH REMOTE
THE BLINKING
AT THE SAME TIME IF IT'S A DARK ROOM IT CAN BE USED TO LOCATE THE REMOTE ALSO OR
YEAH YOU CAN LET THEM TO DO THAT
N NO BUT THE IF YOU GIVE IT D DEPENDS ON THE EASINESS LIKE THE USER HOW MUCH EFFORT HE CAN PUT
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE UH I WOULD LIKE TO STORE IN CERTAIN WAY
SO IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THE FULL FREEDOM TO THE USER OR YOU WANT TO KEEP SOME CONSTRAINTS AND LET THE USER USE IT WITH THAT CONSTRAINT
SO IT DE
SO
SO
YEAH
YEAH
WE WELL WE CAN STILL LOOK AT WE CAN TALK WITH THE COFFEE UNIT AND YOU CAN UH CHECK HOW MUCH HOW MUCH THEY YEAH YEAH YEAH
MAYBE WE CAN COME WE WE CAN TALK TO THEM AND WE CAN COME WITH THAT YOU KNOW
AND ALSO WELL YOU CAN THINK OF HAVING UH SINCE YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW SOMETHING MAYBE IF YOU ADDED LITTLE BIT OF DISPLAY
YOU MIGHT NEED THE TO CHE KEEP CHECKING THE BATTERY
SO YOU REALLY NEED A SOME KIND OF INDICATOR SO IT COULD BE A BLINKING OPTION OF L. E. D. IT COULD ACTUALLY BE USED TO DETECT ALSO
IF IT'S IN A DARK ROOM YOU CAN BASICALLY DETECT IT ALSO
SO
NO ACTUALLY I IF I IT IS LIKE YOU KNOW IT TELLS YOU UM IT CAN BE FOR TWO PURPOSES
LIKE IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY AND ALL THOSE THINGS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE STANDARD REMOTE
WHICH IS HAVING UH WHICH NEED JUST UH SIX SIX VOLT UH TH SORRY THREE VOLTS UM OF D. C.
IT MAY NEED MORE ACTUALLY SO Y YOU YOU MAY NEED TO CHECK YOUR BATTERY USAGE IT AND THEN YOU NEED THAT
SOME FUNCTIONALITY TO INDICATE THE BATTERY LIMIT
AND THEN IF THE BATTERY LIMIT IS INDICATED
IF IT COULD BE IND INDICATED THROUGH A BLINKING SOMETHING AND IT CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR DEPENDING ON YOUR UH HOW MUCH IS THE BATTERY
WELL THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO EVEN LOCATE EVEN IF YOU WANT TO
YOU KNOW
YEAH SO
YOU YOU HAVE TIME SOME MORE
YEP
SURE YOU CAN YOU KNOW
HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH MM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
SORRY
YEAH SO OF COURSE FOR EXAMPLE UH I WANTED TO KNOW LIKE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A A FO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY OVER THERE
OR IF YOU WANT TO STORE A PROGRAMMES WITH A KEYS
WHAT KIND OF THINGS YOU'LL NEED INSIDE YOUR THIN INSIDE
W WH WHAT
W WHAT
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO IN THAT CASE YOU CAN EVEN LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY WHAT THE MOBILE PHONE IS TRYING TO USE WITH THE CARD
YEAH WHERE THEY DO ALL THE WI WITH WITH THEM ACTUALLY
HOW F COST EFFECTIVE IT WOULD BE TO PUT THAT CAR CHIP INTO IT AND DO THE PROGRAMMABLE THINGS
D WELL
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL FIT INTO OUR COST OF TWELVE POINT FIVE EURO YOU KNOW
IS IT POSSIBLE TO FIT IN TO THAT
SORRY
YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH I WANTED TO ASK YOU ALSO LIKE WHAT WILL BE THE EACH INDIVIDUALLY THE COST OF IT
FOR EXAMPLE IF F IF YOU WANT TO PUT WOOD I WOULDN'T SUGGEST FOR WOOD UH 'CAUSE IT'S I THINK IT'S M
MUCH EASIER TO USE A PLASTIC OR A RUBBER RATHER THAN WOOD
IT WILL BE MUCH CH MUCH EXPENSIVE TH THOUGH IT'S THE MOST NATURAL THING BUT
YEAH
YEAH IT'S UH
YEAH WE WE CAN GIVE A PREFERENCE TO THEM
BUT IT IS BUT WITH PLASTIC OR THE RUBBER OR WHATEVER IT IS IT'S MUCH BETTER WITH THAT RATHER THAN GOING FOR
YEAH
YEAH
YEA
OKAY
YEAH SURE
YEAH WE WILL UH
YEAH
UH
YEAH
OKAY
WE CAN GIVE THEM SMOOTH KEYS YOU KNOW
SMOOTH KEYS
WITH BIGGER S UH
SO THAT YOU KNOW
THE THE PROBLEM MOST OF THE TIME WE'VE SEEN THE KEYS IS THAT IT'S SMALL
AND EVERY TIME WE HAVE TO BE VERY BUT IF I THE IF WE IF WE GO TO A DIFFERENT WAYS OF DESIGNING THOSE KEYS
THEN YOU CAN MERGE THEM TOGETHER TO
OH YOU CAN ACTUALLY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SEE THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE QUITE SMALL OVER HERE AND UH NOW YOU CAN
FOR EXAMPLE AS I WAS IF YOU MAKE THEM BIG IT MAY CHANGE THE LOOK OF THE THING ALSO TO THE PEOPLE
AT THE SAME TIME IT IS M MORE UH LIKE IT WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING THIS R. S. I. AND ALL PROBLEM
UH BIG KEYS MAY BETTER FOR THEM ACTUALLY AND UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YES
YEAH SO IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE MODEL HERE S YOU CAN PUT THE KEYS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH MM
WE SHOULD MAKE A
YEAH THAT YEAH NEXT MEETING WE SHOULD BE
YEAH THAT WOULD DEPEND UPON US ACTUALLY
YEAH OKAY
NO NO
I DON'T HAVE
MAYBE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF YOU COULD LOOK UM
FOR THE COST INVENTORIES OF OTHER DEVICES IF YOU'RE USING SPEECH RECOGNITION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MM
TWO
ONE FOR LIKE COST AND THE ONE WITH LIKE HIGHER END SO THAT THEN WE CAN BE EASILY COMPARING THEM OR YOU KNOW FIND A COMPROMISE BETWEEN BOTH OF THEM
YEAH THAT'S HOW IT IS
YEP
OKAY
SO WE ARE DONE
FOR NOW
OKAY SO WE ARE JUST WAITING FOR MATTHEW
MM 'KAY
YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK YEAH THE MATTHEW IT IS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MATTHEW YEAH IS HERE BECAUSE
IT'S REALLY A A TEAM UH PROJECT WITH A TEAM AND IF SOMEONE IS NOT HERE THEN WE CANNOT BUT IT'S OKAY IT'S GOOD
MM-HMM
SO CAN YOU REPEAT AND BE MORE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID
UH ABOUT THE FEELING YEAH UH YO
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH VERY CLEAR
TO LET THE PEOPLE CHOOSE YOU MEAN
YEAH
YEAH A RANGE OF UH YEAH A SET OF THREE FOUR DIFFERENT ASPECTS
SURE THAT FITS THE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH I AGREE
YEAH
AND YOUR PART IS VERY RELATED TO MINE BECAUSE WHEN YOU SUGGEST SOMETHING THEN IT HAS TO BE INTEGRATED INSIDE
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHAT FUNCTIONALITIES DO YOU SUGGEST FOR THAT
FOR FACING THIS PROBLEM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH MM
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND YOU WANT OKAY FOR COMING BACK TO ONE POINT Y YOU WANT TO LET THE USER TO PROGRAMMING THE KEYS
SOME OF THEM
AND UH ISN'T THAT TOO DIFFICULT FOR THE WE WANT W I DON'T KNOW IF WE STILL WANT THE UM R. C. TO BE EASY TO USE THAT'S THE COMPROMISE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
A STANDARD
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM YEAH LIKE I WOULD SAY THAT FOR PROGRAMMING UH KEYS YOU SAID
UH IT COULD BE UH EASILY UH DONE WITHIN THE THE PACKAGE OF TWEL TWELVE EUROS
BUT FOR THE A. S. R. SYSTEM UH I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S FEASIBLE TO HAVE THIS OR
WE
EXACTLY YEAH I IF IF IT'S A LOW VOCABULARY IT'S ALREADY IMPLEMENTED AND W HOW MUCH IT'S COST MAYBE WITH A F CHEAP CHIP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
IT'S TRUE
MM-HMM
I DON'T KNOW HOW IF IF I HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE
OKAY
SO WHAT I'M GONNA PRESENT HERE IS VERY UH UM YEAH BASIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ALL THE THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE INSIDE A A R. C. A REMOTE CONTROL
AND HOW IS IT MANUFACTURED H WHAT IS THE PROCESS JUST TO EXPLAIN YOU
SO THE METHOD IS THER THERE IS A A SET OF COMPONENTS IN A IN A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE
AND UH WHAT COST THE THE COMPONENTS IN THEMSELF DO NOT COST A LOT BUT THE THE WAY TO ASSEMBLE EVERYTHING COSTS OBVIOUSLY
AND I WILL UH SHOW YOU MY PREFERENCES UH UH AT THE END
SO THERE ARE TWO UH DIFFERENT TYPES OF UH UM
TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF USING THE THE COMPONENTS FOR MAKING A A REMOTE CONTROL
UH THE BASIC WAY IS TO USE A AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT AND SOME UH TRANSISTORS WITH AN THAT AIMS AT COMMUNICATING UH UH THE MESSAGE AND TO TO SEND THE MESSAGE TO THE UM TO THE LED THAT WILL UH TRANSMIT TO THE RECEIVER
AND UH YEAH THE OTHER COMPONENTS AND THE CIRCUIT BOARD BUTTONS INFRARED LED ETCETERA FOR THE COMPONENTS UM
SO YOU FINDING JUST TO SAY THAT THE CHIP CAN DETECT UH WHEN A KEY IS PRESSED AND THEN IT TRANSLATE TO THE KEY
TO A SEQUENCE SOMETHING LIKE MORSE CODE AS YOU KNOW UH WITH A DIFFERENT SEQUENCE FOR EACH KEY
AND UH UH THAT'S WITH THE COMPONENTS WE WILL USE WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT UH MESSAGES DIFFERENT SEQUENCES
AND THE CHIPS SENDS THAT SIGNAL SIGNAL TO THE TRANSISTOR THAT AMPLIFY TO MAKE IT STRONGER UM
SO ELECTRONIC PARTS ARE ASSEMBLED ONTO UH PRINTED BOARDS UH BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO MASS PRODUCE AND ASSEMBLE
AND UH SO I THINK FOR OUR DESIGN WE WANT SOME B UH PROGRAMMABLE UH YOU KNOW V. V. L. S. I. OR F. P. G. A. UH HIGH TECHNOLOGY
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT AND ALSO WE'LL USE UH YEAH LIKE IN ANY UH HIGH TECH UH DEVICES A CHIP OF FI FIBREGLASS TO THEM AND CONNECT THEM
SO MY PERSONAL DESIGN WE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION WHAT UM WHAT IS THE MATERIAL OF THE COVER WE WANT TO USE
IF IT'S PLASTIC OR YOU SAID THAT YEAH YOU HAD SOME IDEAS UH LIKE FRUIT VEG OR I DUNNO
YES
YES
YES
YEAH LIKE THEY DO IN WITH CARS I THINK
YEAH INSIDE THE CAR YEAH
SO THEY ALSO EMAILED ME THAT UH THEY HAVE AVAILABLE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BUTTONS A SCROLL WHEELS INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTONS S SUCH AS A COMPUTER MOUSE
AND UH VERY CHEAP L. C. D. S SO LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS SO I'M WONDERING I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE L. C. D. INTO OUR R. C.
AND THE FINAL POINT OKAY IS UM WE HAVE YEAH THERE ARE SOME UH COMPROMISE TO TO DO
SO WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THE PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP
BUT THE SCROLL WHEEL UH AND THAT KIND OF HIGHER HIGH TECH STUFF NEEDS MORE MONEY UM WHICH IS A HIGHER PRICE RANGE ALRIGHT
AND THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP WHICH IN TURNS IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REGULAR CHIP
BUT I THINK UH WITH TWELVE EUROS UM AND IF IT'S UH UH MADE FOR MM FOUR MILLION UH ITEMS
THEN I THINK W WE COULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT
SO TO TO SUM UP UM
WE NEED YEAH SO I I JUST SAID THAT THE COMPONENTS UH THE LIST OF COMPONENTS UH HAS TO BE UH YEAH LISTED AND UM AND UM ASSEMBLY IS A AN IMPORTANT PROCESS THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
AND UH FOR THE DESIGNING OF THE COVE UH UH COVER LAYOUT THEN IT'S BETTER TO TO TO MAYBE SEE THAT WITH UH THE THE U. R. EXP U. R. I. EXPERT SO THAT WE CAN IT'S REALLY A TEAM WORKING UH
SO I I CANNOT DESIGN SOMETHING WITHOUT YOUR AGREEMENT RIGHT
YES
YEAH IT'S KIND OF UM SIMPLE PRO PROGRA PROGRAMMABLE DEVICE AND WE HAVE TO INSERT
I THINK WE COULD INSERT ONE THAT COULD UNDERLIE SEVERAL FUNCTIONS OF
EXACTLY YEAH FOR CUSTOMIZING AND YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH GOOD IDEA
YEAH
EXACTLY YEAH THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA WE COULD HAVE UH ONE MAIN CHIP UH THAT COULD HANDLE UH IT'S CALLED F. P. G. A. CHIP
THAT COULD HANDLE BOTH UH LIKE SCROLLING WHEELS AS WELL AS UH L. C. D. AND YEAH
YES
YEAH ALSO THINKING I THINK BOTH UH IF WE HAD A BUDGET OF TWENTY TWENTY UH EUROS IT WILL BE OKAY BUT UH
YEAH THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA
YEAH YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE PRICE IN IN HEAD BUT FOR NEXT MEETING I'M SURE YEAH BE ABLE TO DO THAT
YEAH
OKAY
I AGREE ON THAT
YEAH
YEAH BUT I IT'S A DETAILED UH YEAH YEAH UH PLASTIC VERSUS UH WOOD
AND WE NEED MAYBE TO CENTRE OUR DESCRIPTION ON UH THE THE REALLY THE WHAT BUTTONS WHAT UH FUNCTIONALITY WE WANT TO OFFER TO THE USER
AND MAYBE WITH UH GRAPHS OR I DON'T KNOW UH USER INTERFACE DESIGNER YOU COULD MAYBE UH HELP US ON THAT
YEAH
PERFECT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH CUSTOMIZED
YEAH
I AGREE YEAH AND NOT TOO M TOO MANY KEYS OF COURSE YEAH
YEAH
MM
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN
YEAH I LIKE ALSO THIS ONE
YEAH
THE POINT IS W MAYBE WE NEED TO ALSO TO MAKE A DECISION ON HOW HOW HOW BIG WE WANT TO BE AND HOW MANY BUTTONS LIKE N WE SHOULD DEC DECIDE NUMBERS OR
OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
PERFECT
EXACTLY
YEAH
TWO OR THREE PROTOTYPES
TWO
OKAY
YEAH AND FIND MAYBE A COMPROMISE
PERFECT YEAH
THANKS
DID YOU GET MY EMAIL WITH THE SLIDES
AH
TRICKY
DUNNO
MAYBE THEY'RE SUPPOSED THE PEN'S SUPPOSED TO GO OVER THE SEATS
MIGHT BE SEAT FLOOR RATHER THAN PERSON
YEAH PUT IT BACK
YEP
YEAH
JO'S MAKING FACES AT ME
MM-HMM
MM
MM OBJECT TRACKING
OKAY
WELL WE CAN'T NO WE CAN'T DO EVALUATION 'TIL WE HAVE A DESIGN
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY SO IT'S IT'S T A VERY BASIC REMOTE THEN IT'S ONLY
MM
MM
CAN I SEE
THANKS
OKAY I LIKE THE VOLUME CONTROL THAT'S GOOD
UH-HUH
SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE BUTTONS
DID YOU WANNA SEE
MM
IT WON'T TALK BACK
RIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
SO IT'S WELL OUTSIDE THE BUDGET THEN
THAT'S ON TOP OF THE SIXTEEN OR IS IT PART OF THAT
SO THAT TAKES IT DOWN TO THIRTEEN EUROS WITHOUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
MM-HMM
MM
WHAT'S THIS ONE ON THE SIDE
AH OKAY
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
I LIKE THE SHAPE OF THEM I DO LIKE THE
THE SIZE AND THE THE SHAPE
MM-HMM
OKAY
AND MAYBE WE RUN THE EVALUATION ON BOTH OF THE PRODUCTS BOTH OF THESE TWO
OKAY
BASICALLY THIS IS WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY UM FROM THE MARKETING POINT OF VIEW
WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT YEP
SO IT'S JUST A SHORTLIST OF CRITERIA ON UM THE THINGS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS BEING IMPORTANT TO SELLING THE PRODUCT
UM WE JUST GO THROUGH THESE AND RATE THEM AS A GROUP AND THEN AT THE END WE'LL MAKE AN EVALUATION BASED ON THAT
SO JUST AVERAGE THE SCORE OF THOSE ITEMS SO
THESE ARE THE THINGS WE IDENTIFIED AS BEING IMPORTANT
UM THE THREE THINGS WERE LOOK AND FEEL INNOVATION AND EASE OF USE
WERE THE THREE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS UM APPEALING TO THE CORRECT DEMOGRAPHIC SO USING THOSE THINGS IN THE RIGHT WAY TO APPEAL TO OUR DEMOGRAPHIC
AND THEN GOIN FOLLOWING THE COMPANY MOTTO FOLLOWING THE FASHION TRENDS AND PUTTING THAT INTO THE PRODUCT AS WELL
SO WELL DO YOU WANNA GO THROUGH AND PUT THROUGH THOSE ON THE THE TWO PRODUCTS NOW OR DO WE WANNA DISCUSS THEM FURTHER AND THEN EVALUATE THEM
OKAY
SO F JUST GO THROUGH ONTO THE WHITEBOARD I GUESS
NOT SURE HOW THIS IS GONNA COME OUT
SO THE FIRST ONE WAS REALLY VERY FAR BELOW BUDGET
WOULD YOU WANT TO TAKE THE PRICE DOWN OF THE END PRODUCT ACCORDING TO THAT OR JUST HAVE THE HIGH PROFIT ON IT
'CAUSE IF WE'RE ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT FOR EIGHT EUROS THEN WE HAVE A
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEP
MM-HMM
OKAY SO LOOK AND FEEL INNOVATION
MM-HMM
AND TRENDS
OH YOU FOLLOWING THE IDEA OF USING THE UM REMOVABLE COVERS ON THESE
IS THAT PART OF BOTH OF THEM OR
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
YEP
SO IT'S THE PINK
AND THE OTHER ONE'S GREEN
OKAY SO LOOK AND FEEL
WHERE UM ONE IS I'VE BROKEN THE PEN AGAIN
S YEAH
GET THAT ONE
UM W ONE'S BAD AND SEVEN'S THE BEST
SORRY ONE'S TRUE AND SEVEN'S FALSE
ONE'S THE BEST
SO ON A SCALE OF ONE TO SEVEN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
ON THE SCALE U IT'S BETWEEN FUNCTIONAL AND FANCY BASICALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT SO
MM-HMM
FOUR
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
NO THAT'S THE INK'S DRIED
BATTERY'S LOW ISN'T IT THE INK
THE B THAT'S THE THAT THAT ONE
BATTERY THERE
MM
NO I THINK IT'S LOST A BATTERY
NO IT'S IT WOULD STILL WRITE BUT IT WOULDN'T PICK IT UP WITH THE SENSORS
YOU GOT A SECOND
WELL WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL
IS THAT WORKING
DID IT COME OUT
GOOD
OKAY
BECAUSE WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IT STILL EVEN IF IT WASN'T WORKING
IT'S JUST A NORMAL WHITEBOARD MARKER BUT IT WOULDN'T BE PICKED UP ON THE THE ACTUAL WHITEBOARD
AND THE OTHER ONE
I THINK IT'S SLIGHTLY BETTER UM
IT'S HARD TO TELL FROM JUST THE PLASTICINE BUT
MM
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
THE OTHER THING IS IS THE LEFT HAND ONE PROTRUDING
'CAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE LEFT HANDED THEY WANT TO USE THE OTHER HAND MAYBE IT WON'T WORK SO WELL
OKAY
I'D SAY TWO OR THREE FOR THAT ONE PERSONALLY
PROBABLY MORE TOWARDS THREE THAN TWO
OKAY
MM OKAY
YEAH IT'S D IT'S DEFINITELY MORE FANCIER THAN THAT ONE
OKAY
SO CONSENSUS
TWO OR THREE
TWO
UM 'KAY
INNOVATION
THE FIRST ONE NOT REALLY MUC
MM
YEAH
DO WE
MM
WHAT WHAT FEATURES ARE WE ACTUALLY INCLUDING
ARE WE INCLUDING LIKE A LOCATION KIND OF THING LIKE TRYING TO FIND IT
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT
BUT TH IS THERE ANY THERE'S NO ACTUAL INNOVATION IN THAT AT ALL IT'S JUST A STRAIGHT OUT REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
OKAY
SO THERE'S NO THIS UH LOOK AND FEEL THING THOUGH THAT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
SO I'D BE UP FOR SEVEN FOR INNOVATION
OKAY
SO WHAT IS IT WHAT ARE THE INNOVATIONS WITH THIS
GOT THE L. C. D. SCREEN
IS THAT IN THIS ONE THOUGH
IS THIS 'CAUSE THIS IS THE
TH TH THERE WERE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WE DISCUSSED THEN WE DISCUSSED THE ONE THAT WAS IN BUDGET AND THE ONE THAT WAS OUT OF BUDGET
OKAY
SO THE COST FOR THESE WERE WHAT WAS THE COST FOR THE FIRST ONE
EIGHT EUROS
AND THIS ONE WAS SIXTEEN EUROS
OKAY
SO
INNOVATION FOR THIS ONE IS TWO
ONE
TWO
MM
WELL THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS A VERY GOOD INNOVATION I BELIEVE IT SO
GIVE IT A ONE
YEP
OKAY
EASE OF USE
MM
YEAH
YEP
SO THAT'S MAYBE A A TWO FOR EASE OF USE
OKAY
SO MAYBE A THREE OR A FOUR
MM
OKAY
CONSENSUS
THREE OR FOUR
THREE
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO THREE'S UH HOW WELL IT GOES TO THE TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC
SO WE'RE D WE'RE STILL THINKING TWENTY TO FORTY YEAR OLDS
THAT'S
MM
SO SH COMPLETELY CHANGED OUR DEMOGRAPHIC THERE IT'S NOT PART OF THE THE FUNKY YOUNG THING
YEAH
IF IT WAS THE VERY BOTTOM PRICE RANGE OR IT WAS LIKE BETWEEN THIS AND ANOTHER ONE WE DID THE SAME THING THEN I CAN IMAGINE IT BEING APPLYING TO THE THE DEMOGRAPHIC YEAH
THAT'S IT'S STILL YE
MM
'CAUSE WE HAVE GOT ROOM WE'VE GOT SOME BUDGET THERE TO ADD A FEW THINGS TO IT THAT'S RIGHT
MM-HMM
AND
MM
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAP WHATEVER THOUGH IT WAS SET WITH I WE'VE GOT A SET PRICE
YEAH
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD MAKE ME SPEND AN EXTRA K FEW EUROS ON THAT ONE RATHER THAN ANOTHER ONE
OKAY
UM AND THE DEMOKRAPHI DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE SECOND ONE
IT'S GOT THE GOT THE THE TOYS IN IT IT'S GOT THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
I THINK ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GONNA N HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN ON A LOW RANGE PRODUCT THEN THAT'S GOOD
MM
OKAY
I'D PROBABLY GO WITH THREE AGAIN FOR THAT ONE
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO TWO YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEP
AND ESPECIALLY I GUESS 'CAUSE THIS HAS THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AS WELL AND THAT MAKES IT MORE APPEALING IT'S MORE OF A A NEW FUN TOY
MM-HMM
OKAY
AND FOLLOWING THE TRENDS
SO THE TRENDS WERE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND THE SPONGY FEEL
SO AS IT IS NOT REALLY DOING EITHER OF THEM
WELL THE SPONGY COULD BE PART OF THE THE FEEL OF THE BUTTONS AS WELL
I KNOW SOME HAVE YOU TRIED THE MOBILE PHONES THAT HAVE GOT THE KINDA SPONGY BUTTONS AND NOT NOT EXACTLY SPONGY BUT I'M THINKING ONE OF THE NOKIAS THAT'S GOT LIKE YOU CA IT HASN'T GOT INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS IT'S GOT JUST A ONE BIT ON IT AND SO YOU CAN THAT FEELS KINDA SPONGY
SO IT'S SORT OF YEAH
MM
OKAY
BUT THAT'S IF YOU'RE USING THE COVERS
OR IS IT JUST ONE
WELL THEY MAKE IT FOR MOBILES IT CAN'T BE THAT MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
SO YOU GOT THE OPTION OF HAVING DIFFERENT COLOURS OR DIFFERENT TEXTURES
MM
MM
MM-HMM
I THINK THE IF WE DO THE COVER THAT'S REALLY GOING WITH THE COMPANY'S PHILOSOPHY OF HAVING THE FASHION IN IN ELECTRONICS
IT LETS PEOPLE HAVE THE LATEST FASHION EVEN NEXT YEAR WHEN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES MIGHT BE OUT
YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE TO PUT A NEW COVER ON IT AND THEN IT'LL STILL BE IN FASHION
MM
MM
MM
MM
YEP
YEP
MM
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF HAVING THE DIFFERENT COLOURS DIFFERENT COVERS
MM
THERE'S N YEAH
'CAUSE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE FEATURE THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN EITHER OF THEM
ALTHOUGH IT IS MORE WITH THE SPONGY BUTTONS ON THE UM
ON THE OTHER ONE
OKAY
SO
TWO AND THREE OR ONE AND TWO
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY SO THE AVERAGE OF THAT IS
THREE SIX NINE DIVIDED BY FIVE SO FIVE
MM
NINE BY FIVE ONE POINT S EIGHT
THIS ONE ELEVEN THIRTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE DIVIDED BY FIVE IS FOUR POINT TWO YEP
OKAY
BUT WE STILL GOT A VERY DIFFERENT PRICE FOR THOSE TWO SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY COMPARABLE YET ANYWAY
YEP
YEP
MM-HMM
WELL IT'S EASIER TO JUST MAKE THAT ONE CHEAPER BY JUST TAKING THE SPEECH RECOGNITION OUT
THAT'LL BASICALLY TAKE US DOWN TO THE BUDGET
MM
YEAH IT'S GONNA BE MORE THAN JUST THE BIGGEST CASE DEFINITELY
EITHER OF THEM
MM
THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO BE NOT BASIC CASES
MM-HMM
YEAH
THE BASIC ONE YEP
SO NOW WE'RE EITHER GOING BUTTON OR L. C. D. S L. C. D. DISPLAY
IS THAT PRICE PER UNIT OR FOR THE WHOLE
THING
SO IT WOULD NEED TWELVE BUTTONS
MM
AND THAT'S WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
SO WE'D HAVE A SPECIAL COLOUR SPECIAL FORM AND SPECIAL MATERIAL ON ALL OF THEM
THEY'RE NOT JUST STANDARD BUTTONS
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE CURVED ON TWO IT'S LIKE IT'S CURVED ON THE SIDES AND CURVED ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM AS WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
YOU TALKING ABOUT CONCAVE CURVES
YOU THINK A SINGLE CURVED
MM
WE HAVE MORE WE'VE GOT THOSE THE SCROLL WHEEL ON THE SIDE AND YEAH
THE SC
MM
WE'VE GOT A SCROLL WHEEL FOR THE VOLUME DON'T WE OR IS IT SOME OTHER THING THAT'S NOT ON THERE
'KAY WE'VE ONLY GOT FIVE MINUTES LEFT GUYS SO WE NEED TO WRAP IT UP PRETTY FAST
SO THIS IS EVEN MORE THAN THE UM
THAN THE COST YOU GAVE THE SIXTEEN EUROS
BUT THAT'S SEVEN BASIC BUTTONS RIGHT SEVEN BUTTONS WITHOUT ANY ADDS ON WITHOUT SPECIAL COLOURS OR FORM OR MATERIAL
WELL
SO THE L. C. D. DISPLAY IS IS THREE FRANCS SORRY THREE EUROS BY ITSELF
MM
SO TWELVE EURO FIFTY WE GOT TWO OFF OF THE BATTERY WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
SO TEN FIFTY IF WE WANT AN L. C. D. DISPRA DISPLAY THAT'S SEVEN FIFTY
UM SO WE'VE GOT SEVEN FIFTY TO USE FOR THE CASE AND FOR THE BUTTONS
AND THE CHIP
SORRY THE CHIP'S UP THERE ALREADY
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SCALE THIS DOWN TO GET WITHIN BUDGET THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
MM
YEP
MM
YEAH
I THINK UNLESS WE CAN REALLY DRIVE THESE PRICES DOWN WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
FOR THE PRICE IT'S GONNA BE WHAT WE CAN AFFORD
AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE WE CAN'T AFFORD THE L. C. D. DISPLAY THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN GET IT IN THERE
MM
MM-HMM
I TH I'D LIKE T IT TO BE IN BUT I CAN'T SEE IT HAPPENING
I CAN'T SEE IT FITTING IN
BU Y YOU'RE A POWER VOTER UH VETO ANYWAY AS PROJECT MANAGER
WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION NOW THAT'S IT
MM
I THINK THEN WE WE'RE REALLY LOSING EASE OF USE
OKAY
OKAY
SO L. C. D. 'S OUT IS SPEECH REC OUT NOW
WE'VE
YEP
YEP
SO ARE WE BASICALLY BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ONE NOW BACK TO THE FIRST VERSION
WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE ON BUDGET EXACTLY PRETTY MUCH
WITH THESE NEW COSTINGS
SO JUST LOOK AT FORGET THAT ONE AND LOOK AT THAT ONE NOW
MM
YEP
OKAY
WELL THAT'S THAT'S
YEP
SO
MM
YEP
SO W WE CAN GO BACK AND L TALK TO THE SUPPLIERS MAYBE AND SEE IF WE CAN DRIVE THE PRICES DOWN TO ADD A FEW MORE THINGS IN BUT THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO WITH THE RESTRICTIONS WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
SO
MATTHEW IS UH LATE AGAIN
PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT MAN
UM
SO WELL IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO BE HERE UH
HE HE HE
YOU DID WORK TOGETHER DIDN'T YOU
YES
YES
YES
MM
UM YES BUT W WE
YES MAYBE WE SHOULD PHONE HIM
UM WELL
UM WHEN HE IS NOT HERE WE WILL JUST WE JUST HAVE TO CONTINUE
UM SO JUST FOR RECORD I I WILL TAKE UH NOTES AGAIN
AND UM
WELL FIRST THING UH I WAS UH UH I GOT AN EMAIL FROM UH FROM MY SUPERIOR AGAIN THAT WE REALLY SHOULD STAY WITHIN THE BUDGET OF THE UH TWELVE EURO AND FIFTY CENTS
IT'S UH WELL HE SAID TO ME WELL UH
WHEN YOU STAY IN IT'S GOOD WHEN YOU DON'T STAY IN YOU HAVE TO REDESIGN
THERE IS NO UH NO NEGOTIATION UH POSSIBLE IN THIS MATTER
SO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT
GOOD
UM
SO MAYBE ANNA YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PRESENTATION
OKAY MATTHEW
NICE UH YOU ARE HERE
GREAT
GREAT
OH MA MAYBE THEN YOU CAN START NOW WITH MM PRESENTING YOUR UH YOUR DESIGNS
MM
EYE
UH-HUH
YES
AH OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
EXCE EXCEPT FOR THE FOR THE SPECIAL SHAPE THE SURFING BOARD IT HAS A QUITE A A CONVENTIONAL LAYOUT OF BUTTONS UH
MM-HMM
YEAH NO YOU CAN CARRY ON I JUST
LOOK HOW IT FEELS ALL
YES IT REALLY FEELS LIKE LIKE LIKE A MOBILE PHONE
JUST I'M I REALLY WANT TO TALK TO IT
BUT
SO BUT BUT CONTINUE WITH YOUR UH MM-HMM
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
FROM D. V. D. PLAYER TO TELEVISION OR SOMETHING
YES
MM
YES AND AND AND THEN YOU GET FEEDBACK VIA THE L. C. D. YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH BUT BUT BUT BUT UH I IN THERE UH WHEN THIS IS CLOSED WILL IT ALSO UH COVER UP THE L. C. D. SCREEN
BUT BUT THE L. C. D. SCREEN I MEAN IS A VERY UH
WELL AN EYE ATTRACTING FEATURE WHICH SHOULDN'T BE SHOULDN'T BE
THAT TH THAT'S TRUE
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES
YES MORE ROBUST
YES OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
BUT W
MM 'KAY
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL WELL
MM
BE BEFORE TA TALKING ABOUT THE MONEY AND WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND WHAT IS NOT POSSIBLE MAYBE ANNA YOU CAN UH GIVE OUR UH GIVE US YOUR UM
YES
EVALUA EVALUATION AND ALSO THE EVALUATION CRITERIA SO WHAT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT
MM-HMM
WELL JUST
DO IT QUICKLY IF IF WE AL ALREADY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
UM N NO WHY NOT WHY NOT DISCUSS UH DISCUSS IT NOW
MM WELL MY MY PERSONAL VIEW IS UH W WHEN WHEN THIS ONE IS EIGHT EUROS WE MUST THINK HOW CAN WE IMPROVE IT
AND THEN I MEAN W W W YOU MUST JUST SEE IT WE CAN STILL SPEND THIS FOUR AND A HALF EURO AND
TO R BECAUSE TH TH TH THE THE SELLING PRICE IS ALREADY PRITE FIK UH UH QUITE FIXED ON TWENTY FIVE EUROS
SO WE JUST HAVE TO OFFER AS MUCH AS AS WELL VALUE FOR THE FOR THE CUSTOMER UH HE CAN HAVE FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO
MM
UM WELL W W WE CAN STILL DISCUSS THAT
SO UM
AND TOGETHER WITH EVALUATING THIS UH WE WE MIGHT COME WITH NEW IDEAS I MEAN ADDING THINGS OR UH REMOVING UH OF OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE BUT
UM
I'VE RECEIVED UH A FRAMEWORK WHICH WE CAN DO THIS
I MEAN DID YOU HAVE THIS THIS EXCEL SHEET
NO OKAY THIS IS THESE ARE THE THE THE LATEST PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTION UH UH PRODUCTION UNIT FOR SEVERAL COMPONENTS
SO WE CAN UH SEE WHETHER THE THE PRICE IS IS WITHIN THE TWELVE EURO UH FIFTY CENTS UH
SO MAYBE WE CAN START WITH THIS UH CALLING THIS ONE
TH TH THIS IS THE FIRST DESIGN
YES
UH THERE IS ANOTHER PEN
OKAY
'KAY
OKAY
SO
LOOK AND FEEL
WELL YOU ALREADY FEEL THAT UH PRETTY MUCH I THINK
IN I IN MY OPINION
PURELY FEEL IS IS IS VERY GOOD IS VERY GOOD IN YOUR HAND SO I I I WOULD CONSIDER TWO OR OR MAY MAYBE EVEN ONE FOR FEEL
BUT THAT'S JUST HALF WE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER LOOK AND THEN
I IT LOOKS
QUITE CONVENTIONAL
DON'T YOU AGREE
SO MAYBE TWO
HMM
HMM
MA MA MA MA MAYBE SAY SAY FIVE
I IT'S MY OPINION BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT
FOUR FOUR
NOW WE TH TH THEN WE SETTLE ON FOUR
'KAY
CAN YOU MAYBE FIX THE OTHER
MM TRY IT JUST TRY IT
OH IT WILL NOT RI MM MM
YES IT IT HAS A MM
GOOD
GOOD
OKAY
SO THEN THEN
AH
MM
I I
I
WHEN WE WANT TO INCLUDE I I I'M DOUBTING ABOUT THIS THIS COMPONENT
IT IT IT IT BREAKS IN YOUR
MM YES I SEE MM OKAY
WELL R R
MM
I THINK THE LOOK IS BETTER BUT THE FEEL IS IS IS WORSE
SO SO I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS IS FOUR
BUT W W DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK
MM
MM
YES
YES IT BASICALLY IS THE SAME SHAPE
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YES OKAY
TWO
MM
TWO'S GOOD YES
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THE ONLY INNOVA INNOVATION IS THE SHAPE
S SO THAT
MM
YES
A AND THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WELL IT'S QUITE INNOVATIVE
MM
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
MM
WE JUST DISKE DISCUSS IT AS YOU DESIGNED IT AND THEN WE WILL WILL TRY TO GET IT IN THE BUDGET
EIGHT
YES
TWO
WHY IT IS ONE
A MAN W W
YES
THIS THIS IS IT W WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
WELL
GI GIVEN THAT THAT IT WORKS THEN IT'S I THINK ONE
MM
HMM
THREE I WOULD
THREE
NO
YEAH
YES BUT THEN WHEN WHEN HE IS USED TO IT I I IT IS QUITE EASY
SO SO I THINK TH THREE IS GOOD
YEAH
GOOD
WHAT'S THE NEXT
SO
TWE TWENTY TO FORTY YES THAT'S
MM-HMM
WELL EXCE EXCEPT FOR THE SURFING SHAPE
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH WHICH HAS AN APPEAL ON THIS GROUP I THINK BUT
MM W W W WE AFTER THIS WE CAN CAN CONSIDER UH FOR INSTANCE MAKING THIS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO TO THE DEMOGRAPHIC
MM
BUT AS IT IS NOW I W WOULD SAY
MM SIX SOMETHING
DO YOU AGREE
MM YEAH INDEED
TH T T
JU JUST THINK TWENTY FIVE EUROS I MEAN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE CHEAPER
MM
MM
OKAY
YEAH THA THA THA THA THA THAT'S I THINK IT'S BETTER BECAUSE OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN WHICH IS REALLY AN APPEAL ON THE ON THE ON THE
ON THE AND ON THE
MM
SO THE L. C. D. SCREEN UH ATTRACTS YES
BECAUSE IT
MM MA MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER YES SO
WH WHAT WHAT
NO S SAY T TWO
TWO
OKAY THE FINAL POINT TRENDS
MM
MM
I THINK
MM
MM
AND THE THEN WE CAN AL YES
WE CAN WE CAN CONSIDER UH UH IS IT POSSIBLE DO YOU THINK TO TO MAKE A COVER
FOR S SUCH A PHONE
I MEAN
WELL JUST WITH THE WITH THE FLEXIBLE PLASTIC UH
I TH I TH I THINK
O O OR JUST TWO THINGS WHICH CAN BE PUT ON EACH OTHER
YES EXACTLY LIKE IT
UH SO
MAYBE WE CAN BUT WE HAVE TO DECIDE IT WE CAN PUT THE THE THE FANCY F LOOK OF VEGETABLES FOR INSTANCE
TO TO THESE COVERS AND S NOW TRY TO INVEST IN THE IN IN THE FEATURES
MM
MM MM MM MM MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
YES
SO SO SO THAT THAT WOULD MAKE THE TRENDS EQUAL SO WE WE WE REALLY HAVE DON'T HAVE
I MEAN
MM
YES INDEED
YES
SAY SAY ONE AND TWO
ONE AND TWO
SO LE LE LET'S SEE
SO D THIS ONE HAS SPONGY BUT BUTTONS
MM I SEE YES OKAY
GOOD
JUST ADD IT
YOU KNOW
THREE SIX SEVEN
MM-HMM
WE WE MUST TRY TO GET THEM CLOSER
BOTH IN I I OR WE JUST HAVE TO CHOOSE
AND ADAPT
BECAUSE
WHEN WE CHOOSE FOR THIS ONE WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE AND W WHEN WE TO D FOR THIS ONE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MORE CHEAP
YES WELL
BUT I'M NOW DID Y DID YOU WORK WITH THE SAME PRICES THAT I HAVE HERE
MM
MM THA
WELL YES WELL UH RE RECONSIDER IT
SO LET'S LET'S TRY TO TO MODEL THIS THIS PHONE IN THIS SHEET UH WHAT KIND OF ENERGY SOURCE UH I I WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT THAT
IT'S A IT'S A NORMAL BATTERY OR
YES
JUST SO ONE BATTERY
'KAY
ELECTRONICS
GIVEN SPEECH RECOGNITION I THINK W YOU SHOULD GO FOR THE LESS FANCY CHIP
YEAH YES OR SAMPLE SENSOR YES
YES THIS ONE
OKAY
CASE
UM
I SEE I
DOUBLE CURVE
MM
OH YES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME SHAPE BUT ACTUALLY BU
SO TH TH THIS WOULD BE DOUBLE CURVES
'KAY
UH PLASTIC WOULD BE THE MATERIAL
UH SPECIAL COLOUR NOW WE LEAVE IT TO THE COVERS
PUSH
MM YES BUT
YEAH TH NOW THIS IS PER PER UNIT THIS NUMBER OF COMPONENTS
SO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE T
YES
TWELVE I BELIEVE
SO THIS COMES TO EIGHTEEN
SO
SO I THINK BUT TH DO YOU AGREE TH THAT THI
YES I
YES I'M I'M NO I'M NO I'M NOT SH
SURE
YES I KNO UNDES I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN YES
UH-HUH
BOTH
YES
UH
W D WE HAVE WE HAVEN'T TALK ABOUT A BUT THAT'S NO A IS VERY EXP INEXPENSIVE I BELIEVE BUT IT IS NOT IN THE LIST
W HO H IS THIS A SCROLL WHEEL OR IS THIS A A A SORT OF BUTTON WHICH CAN BE PRESSED ON TWO SIDES UH SO FOR HIGHER AND LOWER
MM
MM-HMM
SO UM
WE'RE
WE
WE COULD GO FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE FOR A SIMPLE CHIP BUT THEN WE CAN'T HAVE THE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION YES
YES
SO SO W WHEN WE W A THIS WOULD THIS WOULD BE CUTTING THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
TRANSTI
SAY SAY IT'S REGULAR REGULAR CHIP AND WE STILL ON FIFTEEN SO
YES BUT THAT MAYBE
WELL WE CAN JUST SAY
ONE
CA L WE ARE JUST WHEN WE JUST WANT TO UH TO CUT THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS WE HAVE TO MAKE SEVEN TO TO FIT IN IN TWELVE TWELVE FIFTY
SO IS IT POSSIBLE
MM-HMM
NO NO HE HE HE I I
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OTHERWISE Y YOU HA YOU HAVE A S VE VERY NORMAL UH THING LIKE THIS
MM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
A
MM
MM
I
I THINK WE HAVE TO COME TO A DECISION NOW JUST I I THINK WE WE WHAT WE JUST DO I IS VOTE
ABOUT THE UH THE L. C. D. UH DISPLAY SO
YES
YES
YES
ONE MAN ONE VOTE
S SO WHO THINKS THE THE L. C. D. DISPLY DISPLAY SHOULD BE I SHOULD BE IN IT
MM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM I KNOW BUT
YES
SO UH UH HAVING AN L. C. D. S DISPLAY IS JUST UH UH HAVE VERY VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF BUTTONS
IS THAT ACCEPTABLE
CA CAN I HAVE CAN THE FUNCTIONS BE IMPLEMENT IN AN
YOU'VE YOU YOU AGREE
SO HAV HAV HAVING SEVEN BUTTONS INSTEAD OF TWELVE
SO THAT WOU WOULD BE CUTTING CUTTING SUH SAY ABOUT THESE BUTTONS
MM
MM
SO UM I I THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD CUT THE L. C. D. SCREEN
THAT THAT'S THAT'S MY OPINION
JUST
UH WHERE L. C.
OKAY W WE NOW WE CAN JUST UH
YES
YES
I TH I TH I THINK W WE JUST GO FOR THIS ONE AND THAT THAT NOW TWELVE EUROS IS THE
IS IS THE PRICE OKAY
MY M MY SUPERVISOR WILL BE GLAD THAT IT'S FIFTY CENTS CHEAPER THAN HE EXPECTED
OKAY
OKAY GOOD
THEN WE THE SAME
THANK YOU
THAT WAS IT
I GUESS I HAVE TO CHANGE THE PEN OTHERWISE
WILL BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
YEAH
AND DO YOU THINK IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHAT CAN YOU
YEAH WE WILL YEAH SO I WILL BE ABLE TO TO SUMMARIZE UH OUR MEETING
BUT STILL I THINK UH IT WOULD BE IN VERY IMPORTANT IF THE UH AS UM MAIN DESIGNER
I THINK WE CAN PUT ON THE HERE
UH BASICALLY W YEAH WE WE DESIGNED THE TWO UH ITEMS
UM CAN WE HAVE A PHONE CAN SOMEONE
IT'S REALLY W WELL DESIGNED
YEAH
'KAY
YEP
GREAT
YEP
SO I WILL START BY THE THE BASIC ONE THAT UH
FITS INTO UH EIGHT EUROS ACTUALLY RIGHT SEVEN EIGHT EUROS
AND UH WELL FIRST FOR BOTH THEY HAVE UM A SPECIAL SHAPE MAYBE THE DESIGNER CAN UH EXPLAIN BETTER THAN ME BUT UH IT'S LIKE A SURF BOARD
AND YOU YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SURF TO BROWSE TO SURF T. V. MAYBE THE WEB
AND UH IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING SHAPE BECAUSE UM UNCONSCIOUSLY PEOPLE WANT TO S TO SURF WHEN THEY SEE THIS STUFF
AND ALSO IT'S NOT TOO FAR FROM UM A MOBILE
SO PEOPLE ARE USED TO THAT KIND OF SHAPE RIGHT
DON'T TAKE CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE COLOUR BECAUSE W YEAH WE DON'T TAKE YEAH
SO HERE WOULD BE BASICALLY THE THE THE INFRARED UH UH LED YEAH L. A. L. A. L. E. D.
THE ON OFF BUTTON IN RED
HERE WOULD BE THE VOLUME
ON THE ON THE LEFT OKAY SO EASY TO TURN ON T AND OFF
AND UM SO THIS IS A VERY CHEAP VERSION SO THERE ARE MAYBE YOU CAN CARRY ON UH MATTHEW
HOW CAN YOU CHANGE FROM V. C. R. TO UH T. V. BY THE WAY
OKAY YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SEVEN EIGHT EI EIGHT EUROS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH ACTUALLY YEAH
PLAY PAUSE
EXACTLY YEAH
TO AUDIO AND TO VIDEO ON DEMAND
YES
THIS IS THE ORANGE BUTTON THE MICROPHONE
AN YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
CRAZY DIS DESIGNER OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
OH ACTUALLY WELL
IT'S LOW WEIGHT
YOU HAVE TO SEE YEAH YEAH THE THE COMPONENTS WE PUT INSIDE IS VERY LOW WEIGHT
SO THE THE COST IS ACTUALLY A BIT MORE IT'S UH IT'S IT'S SIXTEEN FRANCS
SIXTEEN EUROS SORRY
THEN IT'S OUT OF BUDGET
BUT THE THE MAIN POINT WE WE TALK ABOUT THAT WITH OUR UH MANUFACTURER
AND THEY SAY BASICALLY THAT THE S. R. SYSTEM WOULD BE UH SOMETHING LIKE THREE FRANCS PER ITEM SO THREE EUROS SORRY
AND UM
NO NO NO PART OF THAT YEAH
YEAH YEAH
WELL I THINK TH TH YEAH WE SHOULD STICK WITH UH A NUMBER OF KEYS BECAUSE IF WE ADD TOO MUCH THEN
IT'S TOO
LOCATI
LOCATION
YEAH
MM-HMM
FUNCTIONALITY
EASY TO USE
TARGET
NO
YEAH
YEAH
FOUR MAYBE
UH
YEAH
IF YOU PRESS LIKE THIS NOT LIKE THIS THEN YOU
BUT
OKAY
TRY A
PERFECT
YEAH YEAH
YEP
WOW
'KAY MAYBE
IT'S NOT A BUTTON IT'S A LED IT'S A
AC ACTUALLY YEAH IT SHOULD BE EMBEDDED
YEAH
OH YOU CAN PUSH PUSH IT AGAIN YOU CAN PUSH IT
YEAH
AND THE L. C. D. MAKES IT BETTER
YEAH
SO I WILL SAY TWO
I WOULD SAY TWO THREE
YEP
BASICALLY THERE IS NO INNOVATION IN THE FIRST ONE COMPARED TO WHAT EXISTS IN THE MARKET RIGHT
YEAH
THE SURF UH DESIGN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU'RE RIGHT
YEAH
AND THE
AND THE SECOND ONE IS REALLY UH STATE OF THE ART UH IN TERMS OF INNOVATION
AND UM WITH MANY MORE FUNCTIONALITIES AND CAN OPEN AND CLOSE THE THE BOTTOM PART
YEAH
AND ALL THE SCROLLING UH BUTTONS AND MENU AND PRO PROGRAMMABLE DEVICE BEHIND THIS
UH COULD PUT IT AT ONE OR TWO I WOULD SAY
PERSONALLY
UH
YEAH AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH
SO
EIGHT
WELL ACTUALLY WE HAVE YEAH TO CHECK AGAIN YEAH
SIXTEEN
W W UN TO BE ONE WHAT WOULD DO WE NEE ACTUALLY YEAH I DON'T SEE OKAY ONE WOULD WOULD BE WITHOUT BUTTONS
BU
YEAH
SO MAYBE WE CAN PUT ONE
IT'S USING SPEECH RECOGNITION YEAH
YEAH ONE YEAH
SO THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY STANDARD SO EVERYBODY I INCLUDING OUR GRANDMOTHERS CAN USE IT RIGHT
YEAH
UM THE OTHER ONE IS QUITE EASY THO THOUGH
ONE ME UM WE HOPE MAYBE SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET UH SCARED WITH THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS
AND THERE IS A LIKE I WOULD SAY THREE
OR MAYBE FOUR
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE IT'S N UH IT'S NOT LIKE A BIG ONE WITH UH ONE HUNDRED BUTTONS OR SO
THIS ONE WOULD BE UH FOR GRANDMOTHERS
NO
YEAH GRANDMOTHERS YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT IT'S I IT WAS WRITTEN THAT IT REALLY SO IMPORTANT
THE UM THE THE LOOK AND UH TAKING CARE OF ITS IT TARGETS THE RIGHT RANGE OF PEOPLE RIGHT
YEAH
BUT W
YEAH
BUT FOR US IT'S YEAH WE HAVE A CONSTRAINT THAT WE NEED TO SELL AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND IF YOU WANT TO TARGET YEAH IF WE WE WISH TO TO SELL FOUR MILLIONS OF THIS I THINK FOR THIS AUDIENCE WE NEED ABSOLUTELY THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH
OR EVEN
EVEN ONE AND TWO
OR TWO
YEAH
TWO YEAH
YEAH
SPONGY
UH THAT MEANS THAT IT GOES IN IN THE WATER
UH OKAY
BUT THIS ONE INCLUDES THIS FEATURE RIGHT
SPONGY BUTTONS
SO
UH THE MAYBE IN THE COLOUR WE CAN MAKE IT UH FRUIT AND AND VEGGIE
YEAH
YEAH
THIS IS POSSIBLE
YEAH EXACTLY LIKE NOKIA PHONES
YEAH
'CAUSE SOMETIMES LOOK AT THIS COMPUTER TH THIS LAPTOP IT'S ALL BLACK AND UH IT'S QUITE CONVENTIONAL
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TOO MUCH FLASHY COLOURS LIKE THIS ONE PRESENTED HERE
SO MAYBE WE COULD DO LIKE IN THE RANGE THE SET OF WHAT WE PROPOSE A BLACK ONE
VERY STANDARD ONE THAT MEETS THE THE REQUIREMENTS OF TH SUCH PEOPLE THAT WANT REALLY STANDARD UH THINGS
YEAH
YEAH SO A A POINT BETTER FOR THE FOR THE NUMBER TWO
OKAY
YEAH THE BLUE ONE UH SPONGY
NINE
VERY GOOD
YEAH IT'S RIGHT YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
SO I I GIVE YEAH I JUST GIVE A CALL WITH THE MANUFACTURER UH AND UH I EXPLAINED THEM AND THEY TOLD ME THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE FOR SIXTEEN FR EUROS
UH UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T SEE THIS CHIP UH MATTHEW SO MAYBE WE HAVE TO RECAP WITH THIS ONE
FOR THIS ONE IT'S A NORMAL BATTERY
UH SAMPLE SPEAKER YEAH
SAMPLE YEAH THIS ONE
SO
SO WHICH ONE ARE WE TALKING TO
WELL
YEAH
IS IT ZERO FRANC
L. C. D. IS
IT'S OKAY
JUST SAY L. C. D.
NO BUT FOR THIS ONE IT'S TWELVE EURO
THERE ARE TWELVE
WAIT A MINUTE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT DOUBLE CURVED IT'S SINGLE CURVED RIGHT
BECAUSE IT'S THERE IS NO LIKE
WELL IT'S YOU KNOW THIS CURVE LIKE THIS SO IT'S W THERE IS ONLY
IS IS IS THERE IS NOTHING LIKE Y YOU KNOW IN THE OTHER STUFF THERE ARE YEAH CONCAVE
SO I THINK WE CAN PUT UM
THE SINGLE CURVED IN THE SIXTEEN
THAT MAKES UH SEVENTEEN
AND WHAT ARE JUST THE BT BUTTONS WE HAVE TWELVE BUTTONS ARE YOU SURE
YEAH
SO I HAD A BAD UH
BAD ESTIMATION
NO NO NO
YES A KIND OF SCROLL WHEEL
OKAY SO BASED ON THAT YEAH UM WHERE IS THE ES OKAY SAMPLE SPEAKER
BUT STILL YEAH IT
NO WE CANNOT YEAH
SO
BUT THE UM
YEAH BUT IF YOU HAVE THE NEAR THE L. C. D. YOU CAN UM CHOOSE SELECT BETWEEN UM YOU KNOW LIKE UNI UNIVERSAL BETWEEN AUDIO
T. V. AND V. C. R. AND THIS NEEDS A NEEDS A ADVANCED CHIP
RIGHT MATTHEW
OR REGULAR CHIP
I THINK YEAH REGULAR TODAY WE YOU CAN DO THAT WITH REGULAR CHIP
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO
AND WHAT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS BUTTONS UH
MY MATTHEW
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS W THIS U UH ITEM
BUT
YOU CANNOT MAKE A PHONE TO YOUR BOSS SAYING TWELVE FIFTY IS REALLY
REALLY LOW NO
AND UH WE DON'T WANT TO TO CHANGE THAT RIGHT
WE WE REALLY WANT A L. C. D. OTHER OTHERWISE WE W WOULDN NOT GET THE MARKET
IT'S EVIDENT
YEAH
AND I DUNNO
SO WHA WHAT WHAT EACH OF US THINK ABOUT THE BECAUSE IT'S MEASURE POINT THE L. C. D. UM
DO YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHE WHEN YOU WATCH THE T. V. IN FACT YOU HAVE A BIG DISPLAY AND MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED ONE MORE IN YOUR HANDS
I DUNNO I'M JUST ASKING
YEAH IT'S TRUE YEAH
BUT UH DO WE WANT THAT
ON THE MARKET POINT OF VIEW YEAH
WHAT DO YOU THINK UH L. C. D. IS A MAJOR FEATURE OR
YOU ASSUME YOU WANT A DEMOCRATIC VOYT VOTE RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
WE NEED TO BE
YEAH
YES
BECAUSE ONE YEAH TH SHOW ME THAT UH ACTUALLY WE COULD IN FACT WE MOVE THESE THREE BUTTONS AND HAVE THREE UH POSSIBILITIES FOR EACH OF THE THREE HERE
HERE ONE AT THE MIDDLE AND AT THE
BOTTOM
OKAY
OKAY
THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS OUT
BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET YEAH
YES
YEAH
ACTUALLY YEAH WE WE WE WILL NOT NEED THE REALLY UH EXPERT DESIGNERS UM BECAUSE THE AMOUNT YEAH
THANKS
OR BROWSE
MM
NOW WE ARE SUPPOSED TO GIVE SOME OPER OFFERS RIGHT NOW
I YEAH
L. E. D.
MM-HMM HMM
ALSO SO YOU HAVE UH UH BROWSING THE CHANNELS ACTUALLY SO YOU CAN GO UP AND DOWN THE CHANNELS
UH IF YOU HAVE A VIDEO OR SOMETHING YOU CAN FORWARD BACK
OH NO NO NO THIS IS A SINGLE THIS THIS IS A MODEL WITH JUST THE T. V. ONE
NO NO JUST SORRY THIS IS A STANDARD T. V. ONE WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT
SO AND THEN WE HAVE USUALLY THERE TWELVE KEYS BUT WE KNOW THAT WE REL THAT WE HAVE ONLY TEN DIGITS
THE EXTRA TWO ARE FOR UH HAVING OR GIVING AN OPTION FOR UH HAVING MORE THAN ONE CHANNEL
AND THE OTHER ONE IS FOR THE TELETEXT OR SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BROWSE THROUGH FROM THAT
ACTUALLY
IT'S A VERY BASIC MINIMAL THING WHICH YOU CAN WHICH IS WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET
ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT IT THAT IT I AND WOULD COST US TO BUILD IT ABOUT EIGHT EUROS
YEAH
YEAH
SO THIS ONE MODEL AND UH YEAH
SURE
TH THIS IS A MAGIC ONE BUT I KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW LIKE UH I I I IT IS A VERY FUTURISTIC
IT'S LIKE UH IT'S LIKE A BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE AND ALL THIS STUFF WE ARE THINKING ABOUT IN THE FUTURE IT CAN COME
SO THAT UH THEN WHAT WE LOOK T YEAH
THIS IS A MODEL YEAH
YEP
UH SO WELL THEN THE THIS IS THE A MORE A LITTLE UH SMOOTH AND IT GIVES A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY
UH IN THIS WAY SO ALL WE HAVE UH TH YOU SEE THERE ARE ONLY SIX KEYS
BUT DON'T WORRY THEY ARE MA THEY ARE DOING THE JOB OF TWELVE KEYS ACTUALLY HERE
AND SO THEY HAVE MORE SPACE ACTUALLY AND UH IT'S EASY TO UH USE THIS AND UH YOU HAVE UM SO THIS IS A STANDARD UH UH INFRARED EYE
AND THEN YOU HAVE A POWER BUTTON WHICH L VOLUME WHAT YOU HAVE
AND THEN OTHER THAN THAT YOU HAVE UH CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND UH F SLOW PAUSE OR S SLOW LO YEAH S PAUSE OR STOP
AND UH THEN UH YOU CAN UH YOU HAVE A L. C. D. DISPLAY
HERE AND UH Y THIS IS A FUNCTIONAL THING WHICH CAN CHANGE LIKE IT'S A TOGGLE SWITCH WHICH COULD CHANGE THE FUNCTION SAY Y YOU PRESS IT
YEAH
I REALLY CAN CHANGE IT SO
INSTEAD OF HAVING MANY SWITCHES Y
THE L. C. D. CAN DISPLAY WHAT IS THAT ON THAT AND UH WELL YOU CAN HAVE A INTEGRATED MICROPHONE OVER HERE OR IN THE BUTTON TH HERE
SO WHICH CAN UH BASICALLY YOU WANT TO DO A SPEECH RECOGNITION AND UH THAT CHANNEL A LOT OF INFORMATION CAN BE DI DISPLAYED HERE DIRECTLY ON THE UM ON YOUR ON YOUR DISPLAY
AND HERE IS A SMALL L. E. D. WHICH IS LIKE BLINKING ONE WHICH TELLS YOU LIKE UH ARE YOU RUNNING OUT OF THE BATTERY
AND WHICH IS CAN BE USEFUL FOR THE LOCATING AS I WAS TALKING EARLIER OKAY
AND UH WELL THEN WE HAVE A COVER BASICALLY BASICALLY YOU DON'T NEED MUCH OF THE TIME THIS
WHEN YOU NEED YOU CAN USE IT AND THIS GIVES ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY THAT TOMORROW YOU WANT YOU CAN ADD A TACTILE THING
TO THIS COVER YOU KNOW
DESIGN ENTER
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S BASICALLY TO DO THAT
ACTUALLY WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING THE T. V. WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING ANYTHING OR LISTENING TO THEM YOU HARDLY CARE ABOUT WHAT IS GETTING DISPLAYED HERE YOU KNOW
UH YOU WANT TO UH AND THIS GIVES A PROTECTION TO THE L. C. D. ACTUALLY GIVING A COVER TO THAT ACTUALLY
GIVES A PROTECTION BECAUSE WHEN IT FALLS DOWN OR SOMETHING
IT IT IS IT IS IS IS IT GIVES A PROTEC IT'S MORE ROBUST THAT WAY
UH YEAH
AND YOU HAVE VERY GOOD CHANCES
YEAH
YEAH
IT
SIXTEEN EUROS
YEAH
THREE EUROS
PART OF THAT
YEAH
WELL UH IF YOU WE CAN HAVE IF YOU HAVE NEW MORE IDEAS WE CAN ADD NEW MORE UH SOME MORE KEYS IF YOU WANT TO YOU KNOW
YEAH IT IT SHOULD NOT BE CLUTTERING UP EVERYTHING
AH THAT'S FOR THE IT'S KIND OF A L. E. D. FOR INDICATING YOUR BATTERY AND AS WELL AS IT'S LIKE A BLINKING ONE YOU KNOW YOU CAN KEEP IT ASIDE
YEAH
AND NOW IT EASY TO USE
NO
MM YEAH
WELL I WILL GIVE IT MAYBE WE HAVE ANYWAYS THE WAY WE HAVE DESIGNED IT'S LIKE THE SURF AS YOU SAY YOU KNOW
IT THOUGH THE LOOK IS FINE BUT UH STILL I WILL GIVE FOUR IN THAT CASE YOU KNOW
FOUR YEAH THAT
YEAH
I WILL GI YEAH
NO
C CAN YOU GET THE BATTERIES
NO NO THE BATTERY HAS FALLEN DOWN THAT'S I
YEAH
NO NO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S HOW TO CLOSE A BATTERY
OKAY
NOW IT SHOULD BE
IS THERE ANOTHER BATTERY THERE
OH YEAH
NO ACTUALLY THIS IS THIS IS NOT GOING TO PROTRUDE ACTUALLY IT IT'S N I IT IS JUS
IT'S A LED ACTUALLY WHICH WHICH 'LL BE COVERING IN A CURVE
IT'S WILL BE EMBEDDED THERE SO IT WON'T BE REALLY YOU KNOW PROTRUDING OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO YOU IT IT NOT PROTRUDING ACTUALLY IT WILL GO IN BETTER INTO THAT
UH IT'S FINE I THINK
MY JUST THAT UM THE FEEL IS THAT UM
YOU RIGHT NOW YOU YOU DON'T SEE THE FEEL BECAUSE RIGHT UH FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PRESS IT QUITE INSIDE NOW LIKE THIS NOW IT'S EMBEDDED ONE
THIS IS HOW EMBEDDED ONE WILL
YEAH
IT'S A BAS BASICALLY THE SAME THING ACTUALLY
YOU WILL BE EXCEPT THAT IN THIS C
YEAH
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A SLIGHT THING FOR TO FORWARD AND
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
LOOKING LIKE
NO BUT EXCEPT FOR THE DESIGN OF THE SURF
YOU SHOULD BE REA
UH NO I THINK IT'S MORE OF THE FEEL
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SAY ABOUT THAT
YEAH
YEP
YEAH IT GIVES IT
YEP
NO WE HA
YEAH EIGHT EUROS YEAH
SIXTEEN EUROS
IT'S A TWO I WOULD SAY TWO
YEAH
OKAY YEAH
UH
HE IS USED TO IT ACT
THEY ARE USED TO IT ACTUALLY
HERE THERE MAY
UH THOUGH IT HAS MORE FUNCTIONALITY I THINK IT SHOULDN'T BE FOR THE USER TO LEARN IT ACTUALLY
IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFI
UH YEAH ACTUALLY IN FACT I THINK IT WILL BE YEAH
YEAH BUT Y
WELL WE HAVE REDUCED THE KEYS ACTUALLY YOU SEE
THREE IS FINE WITH ME
YEAH IT'S A ACTUALLY THE USER HAS TO PUT SOME EFFORT TO DO USE THAT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT SO EASY LIKE THIS ONE THE NORMAL
IS QUITE EASY YEAH
INITIALLY THERE THERE IS A LOT OF EFFORT YEAH
MM
OH NO THIS WOULD I I WOULD I WOULD GIVE THIS MODEL TO THE OLD PEOPLE ACTUALLY
YEAH
AND
OH YEAH
I WELL I THINK
YEAH
UH YEAH BUT BUT IF YOU SELL IT IN THE MARKET IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAP ACTUALLY
SO
AND PEOPLE CAN STILL DECIDE TO USE THE CHEAPER ONE
INSTEAD OF A
OKAY
OKAY
SO IN THAT CASE WELL IT'S FINE THEN
WE CAN YEAH
AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF
YEAH I THINK IT'S UH IT HAS MORE MARKET ACTUALLY
Y YEAH YOU KNOW TWO
YEAH TWO YEAH
BECAUSE TOMORROW THIS WILL BE MORE APPEALING BECAUSE YOU CAN ADD LOT OF SOPHISTICATION ON THAT
BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU HAVE IT UH D YOU HAVE LOT OF THINGS WHICH YOU CAN INCLUDE FOR THE PEOPLE TO
WE HAVE TO PRACTICALLY TEST IT
THE FIELD TEST WILL TELL YOU HOW GOOD
THE TRENDS
MM-HMM
YEAH I KNOW
YEAH
WE WE WE WE WE YEAH IT'S THE WAY THEY ARE GOING TO BE ACTUALLY
BUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO COVER THAT ACTUALLY
IN THAT UH W IN THE MOD
UH UH Y ARE YOU SURE
YEAH I THINK YEAH IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH THE MOBILE PHONE YEAH
YEP
YEAH IT'S ONE
YEAH IT SAYS A
ONE POINT SIX ONE POINT
ONE POINT EIGHT YEAH
FOUR POINT
UH FOUR POINT TWO
WOW
YEAH
YEP
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO RECONSIDER EVERYTHING WITH THIS YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH IT MIGH IT IT'LL NEED UH MORE THAN A CONVENTIONAL ONE IT WON'T BE UH JUST MAYBE YOU MIGHT USE A A. A. BATTERY ACTUALLY
WHAT DO YOU SAY MAEL
YEAH
CURVED
DOUBLE CURVED YEAH RIGHT
IT'S UH
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS OR THAT
MM-HMM
YEAH
A SPECIAL COLOUR
UH
AH GOOD
YEAH WE MIGHT NEED A SCROLL WHEEL RIGHT FOR THAT
NO FOR THAT ONE ALSO
YEAH THAT'S A SCROLL
YEAH ONE SCROLL WHEEL YOU MIGHT NEED
UH
BAD ESTIMATE RIGHT
THAT IS THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER
WE JUST NEED THAT ACTUALLY
WE NEED ONE
S
OH I I IT
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE Y Y YEAH IT'S TH WITH THE REGULAR CHIP YEAH
YEAH
UH
YEAH
THAT'LL BE THEN WE HAVE UH HAVE TO ASK THE USER TO PRESS IT SEVERAL TIMES
UH
OR WE COULD EVEN REPLACE THEM BY BUTTONS ACTUALLY
A ACTUALLY IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONALITIES YOU WANT TO ADD INTO IT
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ADD TWO MORE FUNCTIONALITIES THEN BETTER YOU ADD TWO MORE BUTTONS
OR AND YOU'LL HAVE L. C. D. DISPLAY WHICH IS THAT IS GOING TO BRING THE COST BY TWO TWO EUROS AT LEAST
OKAY SO WE CAN GET RID OF IT AND THEN ADD A COUPLE OF BUTTONS
I THINK BUT
YEAH BUT THE ONLY THING IS THAT WHAT IS THE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITIES YOU WANT TO INCLUDE WITH THAT
YEAH
W I I I JUST
YEAH
THAT WILL CREATE ANOTHER PROBLEM
FOR THE PEOPLE TO USE IT
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY
DOING THAT
NO IT'S OKAY YOU UH CUT THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND INTRODUCE TWO MORE BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
THAT'S IT
COOL
HMM
MM MM MM
IS RECORDED
OKAY
OKAY SO WELCOME EVERYONE
SO WE ARE HERE FOR THE KICKOFF MEETING OF UH THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
SO I WILL FIRST START WITH A WARM WELCOME OPENING STUFF
THEN UH WE WILL UH SEE WHAT WILL BE UH OUR PRODUCT AND WHAT WILL BE THE DIFFERENT STEP WE WILL HAVE TO DESIGN IT
AND UH THEN WE WILL UH DISCUSS IF WE HAVE FEW IDEAS AND WE WILL UH END UH BY UH DISPATCHING THE DIFFERENT TASK YOU WILL BE YOU WILL HAVE TO FULFIL TO COMPLETE THIS PROCESS
SO
SORRY
YOU HAVE ANOTHER MEETING SOON
SO YOU HAVE TO BE QUICK
OKAY
SO THE THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL SO TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COMPETITORS WE HAVE TO BE ORIGINAL
WE HAVE TO BE TRENDY AND WE HAVE TO ALSO TRY TO BE USER FRIENDLY
SO UH THE DESIGN STEP WILL BE DIVIDED IN THREE UH MAIN POINTS
FIRST IT WILL BE THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
THIRD IS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THEN IS THE DESIRED DESIGN
SO THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IS TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN USER NEEDS THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD FULFIL
AND THEN WE WILL MOVE TO F CONCEPTUAL DESIGN WHERE WE'LL SPECIFY THE DIFFERENT COMPONENT INVOLVED
WHAT KIND OF USER INTERF INTERFACE WE WANT AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT UH TREND IN USER INTERFACE AND STUFF LIKE THAT
AND THEN THE DESIRED DEVI DESIGN WILL CONSIST IN UH SPECIFICALLY IMPLEMENTING AND DETAILING THE CHOICE WE'VE UH MADE IN THE SECOND POINT
SO I WILL NOW ASK YOU WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE DESIGN OF A NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR TO UH EACH OF US TO TO DRAW UH YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL ON THE WHITE BOARD
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHICH ANIMAL YOU WANT TO SHOW US
OKAY THAT'S GOOD
N N
YOU SHOULD
IF YOU WANT TO REACT UH ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL DRAWING UH I'LL LET YOU UH COMMENT
OKAY IT'S AN ABSTRACT DRAWING
I THINK IT'S NICE AND ORIGINAL
OKAY
YOU WANT TO DRAW SOMETHING CHRISTINE
OF COURSE YOUR ANIMAL IS RECORDED SO IT'S NOT LOST
IS THIS UH
AH OKAY IT'S PRETTY
OKAY IT'S YOUR CAT
OKAY
OLIVIER DO YOU WANT TO
OKAY I GO BUT NEXT TIME YOU'LL DO SOMETHING I'M SURE
I'M A BIT SHORT ON CABLE
OKAY
SO WHAT COULD I DRAW
MAYBE I CAN DRAW LIKE
A VERY SIMPLIFIED COW
I DON'T KNOW IF IT LOOKS LIKE A COW
LIKE A WHAT
I DUNNO IT IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A DONKEY IN FACT I WOULD SAY
OKAY SO I HOPE THAT IT HELPS YOU UH IN THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
LET'S MOVE ON
SO
HERE THE UH FINANCIAL OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROJECT
THAT IS TO SAY TO TO HAVE A PRODUCTION COST LOWER THAN TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS AND HAVE A SELLING PRICE OF TWICE THAT PRICE T IN ORDER TO TARGET A PROFE PROFIT OF UH FIFTY UH MILLION EUROS
YEAH IF IT'S TRENDY ORIGINAL I D FULFIL THE USER NEEDS
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT POINT
ON YEAH YOU YOU CAN SUGGEST POINTS LIKE THIS
SO WHAT WHAT SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE FOR EXAMPLE IF IT CAN CONTROL ONE DEVICE OR MULTIPLE
SO WHAT'S WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THAT
MAYBE I CAN HAVE THE YOUR OPINION FROM THE MARKETING SIDE
OKAY SO IF IT SELLED UH BY ITS OWN I IT IT WOULD RATHER BE FOR MULTIPLE DEVICE
DO YOU AGREE
YEAH
SO MAYBE IT SHOULD BE FOR MULTIPLE DEVICES
AND UH DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS UM OF UH DESIGN IDEAS OR ANY UH UH TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT WE WE SHOULD UH FULFIL
FEW BUTTONS
OKAY
AND DO YOU HAVE IT ALSO TO BE TO BE LIGHTED IN ORDER TO BE USED IN THE DARK
MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
OKAY
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY UM ANY UH IDEA OF THE TREND THE TREND IN DOMAIN WHAT IT SHOULDN'T IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE OR THINGS LIKE THAT
WITH ROU OKAY
LIKE FOR OKAY
OKAY
SO
FIT IN YOUR HAND YEAH
AND ALSO IT HAVE I IT MAY BE IT MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE UH
TO TO RESIST TO VARIOUS SHOCKS THAT CAN HAPPEN IF IT FALL
WATER PROOF AS WELL
MAYBE IT IS ORIGINAL BECAUSE YOU CAN UH USE IT IN YOUR UH IN YOUR BATH WHEREAS THE OTHERS CAN'T
MAYBE WATER PROOF WOULD BE VERY ORIGINAL
HAVIN HAVING A WATER PROOF REMOTE CONTROL SO THAT THE PEOPLE CAN UH USE IT IN THEIR BATH
THAT COULD BE UH
YEAH BUT IT IS STILL SOMETHING UH YOU HAVE TO BUY AND THAT IS UM NOT MAYBE VERY
YEAH MAYB
B
BUT MAYBE WE CAN BULK IT WITH UH ALREADY THIS PLASTIC THING AND UH THE WATERPROOF UH STUFF AS WELL
YEAH
MAYBE WE CAN SELL UH ALL THAT TOGETHER SO SO PLASTIC PROTECTION
AND UH AND A WATERPROOF BOX AS WELL
THAT MIGHT BE GOOD UH TRACK TO FOLLOW
OPTIONAL OR SELLED WITH IT
YEAH
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE UH
BUT WE DON'T DESIGN THE T. V.
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE UH SOMETHING YOU WHISTLE AND UH THE REMOTE CONTROL UH BEEP
YEAH BARKS YEAH
SO WE CAN UH HAVE A WHISTLE UH REMOTE CONTROL
I DON'T KNOW WHISTLE ABLE
TH
WHISTLE TRACKING YEAH
WHISTLE TRACKING REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT'S VERY ORIGINAL AND THAT'S CAN UH IMPROVE
YEAH D D UH
YEAH BUT S STILL WE HAVE TO MM WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COMPETITORS
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD ADVANTAGE
YEAH
WE HAVE TO ASK
YEAH
WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUEST OF THAT'S UH DESIGN TO THE UH INDUSTRIAL UM DESIGNER
WHICH IS YOU
OKAY SO TRY TO FIND THAT FOR NEXT MEETING
OKAY
SO NEXT MEETING IS IN THIRTY MINUTES OR SO UH
DON'T PANI
SO SO I WILL ASK THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS INDUSTRIAL DESIGN SO ANY WORKING ANY WORKING FUNCTION WE HAVE DISCUSSED
SO THEN I WILL ASK THE USER INTERF INTERFACE DESIGNER TO TO THINK ABOUT THE POINT WE DISCUSSED LIKE THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS
THE THE FACT THAT IS LIGHTED OR NOT THINGS LIKE THAT AND WHAT WOULD BE CONVENIENT FOR THE USER
AND ALSO UM I WILL ASK THE MARKET EXPERT TO UH TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE THE ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS
WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED IN A REMOTE CONTROL UH FOR THE USER
SO
AND THEN UH I WILL UH JUST ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND UH LOOK AT YOUR MAIL BECAUSE YOU WILL RECEIVE UH SOME GOOD ADVICE SOON
SO
THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S ALL FOR THIS POINT
ANYWAY YOU WILL RECEIVE SOME MESSAGES
BE CAREFUL
YOU EAT IT
DOES IT MOVE UH
OKAY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT UH IS STILL CORRECTLY UH
WE'LL SEE
HOW DO YOU WEAR THIS THING
NOT TOO MANY CABLES AND STUFF
ORIGINAL
UH
JUST ONE THING
UH YOU SAID TWENTY FIVE MINUTES BUT I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO UH
SO GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER MEETING UH SOON SO MAYBE YOU COULD HURRY UP A BIT
IT'S TRUE
I HAVE ANOTHER MEETING SO IF YOU COULD UH
YEAH
YEAH FOR THE LAWNMOWER PROJECT
OKAY
WHAT AN ORIGINAL IDEA
ORANGUTAN
CAN I GIVE YOU THE NO
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING
WHEN I'M DRAWING THE ORANGUTAN
IT'S AN ABSTRACT DRAWING OF AN ORANGUTAN
YES
I DON'T HAVE A RED COLOUR
USUALLY ORANGUTANS HAVE RED HAIR SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T HAVE RED PEN SO
YES
YES
I KNOW
WHA WHAT IS THIS STRANGE BEAST
IS IT A MONSTER
IT'S A CAT
I THOUGHT THESE THINGS DID NOT EXIST
AH YEAH
DOES HAVE A NAME
CARAMEL
AH HA
NEXT TIME I CONCENTRATE
HE LOOKS LIKE A BONG
OKAY
SORRY
NO
SCARY
I I THINK WE WILL BE FINISHED THIS UH
IS IT FOR UH FOR PUTTING A FOR LOGOS NO
THAT'S
I IS THERE A MATTER FOR A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
IS IT UH A SINGLE DEVICE REMOTE CONTROL OR IS IT A MULTI DEVICE REMOTE CONTROL
AH THIS IS NOT DEFINED AT ALL
AH OKAY
WELL UH DO WE SELL OTHER STUFF
UH IF IF WE BUNDLE THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH SOMETHING UH TO SELL THEN IT COULD BE A SINGLE DEVICE
OTHERWISE IT COULD BE PROGRAMMABLE ONE OTHERWISE WHO WOULD BUY A REMOTE CONTROL FROM US
YEAH
NO I COULDN I CANNOT FI THINK OF ANY REQUIREMENTS RIGHT NOW
MM
SOMETHING LIKE THAT LEAST FITS IN YOUR HAND
YEAH
THE BASIC REQUIREMENT
ONLY A BUCK
WATERPROOF
MM
B IT SEEMS UH SO
BUT UH IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN WATERPROOF REMOTE CONTROL IT MEANS YOU CAN JUST COVER IT WITH SOME PLASTIC AND YOU CAN SORT OF F
AND
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THAT'S ONE OF THE SHOCK I MEAN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL AND THEY ARE WORRIED THAT IT'S GOING TO BREAK AND THEY PUT SOME EXTRA PLASTIC AROUND IT
THAT'S PEOPLE THEY ACTUALLY DO IT THEMSELVES
I IT WILL LOOK A BULKY IN THAT CASE
LIKE AS AN OPTIONAL THING
BARKS
THAT'S THAT'S QUITE COOL BUT UH OF COURSE WE YOU DON'T NORMALLY NEED UH ANY AUDIO UH RECORDING STUFF ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT
SO I IT'S JUST GOING TO ADD T TO THE COST
IT'S COOL
I THINK I LIKE THE IDEA BUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE WHAT YOU WHO IS GIVING WHO'S GIVING WHO'S GIVING OUR BUDGET
WHO'S
YEAH
YEAH
'KAY
MM-HMM
MM
GOOD
UH SO WE COME BACK IN FIVE MINUTES
HALF AN HOUR
NO NO N
YOU SHOULD WRITE Y THE NAME I THINK
ME AH YEAH
YEAH
CARAMEL
AND YOU I THINK I'M TOO SHORT FOR THE CABLES
QUITE SQUAREY
HE ALSO
MM
MM-HMM
I THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TOO MANY B FOR MY PART
I THINK
IF WE DON'T HAVE SO MANY BUTTONS COULD BE NICE
YEAH
SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT SQUAREY MAYBE UH NOT A BOX
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A DEVICE
SORRY
YEAH
DIRECTLY
YEAH
AND I I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING MOST OF THE TIME I I LOSE MY REMOTE CONTROL
WE SHOULD HAVE S UH SPECIAL BU BUTTON ON THE T. V. TO MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL BEEPING
AH YEAH
YEAH
BARKS
YEAH
YEAH WHISTLE

ISN'T IT
YES YES IS IT LIKE THAT
IS IT BETTER
OKAY
IT'S MY CAT
YEAH
THE NAME IS CARAMEL
YEAH
THANK YOU
OKAY EVERYONE'S READY
SO WE ARE HERE FOR UH FOR UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
OKAY
SO WE ARE HERE FOR THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING MM SO FIRST I WILL SHOW THE AGENDA SO
WE WILL UH I WILL TAKE NOTES DURING THIS MEETING SO
I WILL TRY TO SUMMARISE IT AND PUT THAT SUMMARY IN THE SHARED FOLDER IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT AFTERWARDS
SO THEN UH EACH OF YOU WILL UH LEAD A PRESENTATION ON THE TASK THAT HAS BEEN REQUIRED LAST TIME SO USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN AND WORKING DESIGN
THEN I WILL UH PRESENT YOU SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS I RECEIVED FROM UH THE MANAGEMENT BOARD
THEN WE WILL TAKE UH THE DECISION ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL UH NEEDED FUNCTIONS
AND THEN I WILL ASSIGN YOU THE TASK FOR THE NEXT PART OF THE MEETING
OF THE OF THE PROCESS
SO UH WHO WANT TO START THE THE PRESENTATION OF WHAT THEY DID
YOU CAN START
YOU HAVE UH POWERPOINT
AH YEAH MAYBE THERE
OKAY
WHO ARE YOU
OUCH
AND
WE HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM UH
YOU PUT IT ON
YEAH
YOU HAVE NO
OVER
OKAY
THERE'S NO
WE HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM
IF YOU REMEMBER YEAH BUT THAT'S
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY SO SPECIAL NAVIGATION LINEAR ACCESS RANDOM ACCESS AND THERE'S A FOURTH ONE NO
SO THE BETTER NOW FOR SPECIAL NAVIGATION
OKAY
THEN LINEAR ACCESS THEN RANDOM ACCESS
AH YEAH PARAMETER OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY AND AND VOICE COMMAND DID YOU UH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO THAT'S UH THAT CLOSE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS
OKAY
OKAY
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE USER REQUIREMENTS WITH
I DUNNO IF I CAN OPEN IT
MAYBE YOU CAN S
IT'S
MESSENGER NO
IN WHICH FOLDER
SHORT CUT TO AMI SHARED FOLDER
MAYBE YOU CAN SEND IT TO ME BY EMAIL
JUST TO PARTICIPANT ONE
AT AMI
I WILL TRY TO SHOW IT TO EVERYONE THAT WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE
YOU SEND IT
YEAH
UH THIS IS THIS EMAIL
OKAY
SO MAYBE I CAN SWITCH SLIDES WHEN YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK THAT WILL BE MORE CONVENIENT
SO OKAY FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
MM
YEAH
WE CAN JUST KEEP DOING THAT
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO FEWER BUTTONS MAYBE WOULD BE GOOD
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH BUT IN FACT WE IT IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL ACCORDING TO NEW REQUIREMENTS I RECEIVED FROM THE MANAGEMENT BO I WILL PRESENT THEM IN THE FOLLOWING
OKAY
YEAH
TO FIND IT
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
WHAT IS HER OTHER SIDE
OH YEAH
I DID NOT KNEW THAT
OKAY SO YOU WE HAVE TO MAKE IT UH MORE ERGONOMIC YEAH
IT'S YOUR JOB OH
UH SORRY GOT A MESSAGE FROM MICROSOFT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE VERY UH ACCESSIBLE
YEAH OKAY
THIS IS THE MAIN FUNCTION OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
TO HAVE L. C. D. AND VOICE
OKAY
YEAH MAYBE THIS THIS IS IMPORTANT
MOREOVER TH MAYBE THOSE UH LIKE THOSE TEENAGER CUSTOMER COULD ADVICE THEIR PARENTS TO BUY THIS EQUIPMENT AND SO WE CAN WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT POINT OF VIEW I THINK OR SO
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY THESE ARE THE USER REQUI
YEAH
NO NO NO
WE W IT SEEMS THAT WE NO WANT TO HAVE A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL
FROM THE MANAGEMENT BOARD I RECEIVE AN EMAIL
COS IT WOULD BE COSTLY
UH AND AND ALSO IT IT WOULD TAKE MORE TIME TO DEVELOP TO HAVE A A GENERAL GENERIC REMOTE CONTROL
THAT IT WOULD BE TOO LONG TO DEVELOP
OH YEAH
BECAUSE I RECEIVED THAT EMAIL FROM MANAGEMENT BOARD AND THEY SEEMS TO TELL THAT THAT IF WE WANT TO BE ON THE MARKET AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WE SHOULD UH FOCUS ON T. V. MORE WHERE IT SEEMS THAT THE MARKET IS MORE IMPORTANT
SO MAYBE IT'S A GOOD DECISION
I DUNNO
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION
OKAY
MAYBE YOU CAN GO TO THE WHITEBOARD IF YOU HAVE SOME DRAWINGS TO DO I DON'T KNOW
OKAY
ARE YOU OKAY
U. C. IS THE CENTRAL UNIT
OKAY YEAH
COMPUTATION
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO THIS IS QUITE EASY
THERE IS NOT THAT MUCH CONSTRAINTS
TO HAVE A YOU S YOU SPEAK ABOUT WITH VOI VOICE CONTROL
STANDARD BUTTON ONE
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION NOW
OKAY SO I IT'S A BIT LONG YEAH
ONE MONTH FOR THE STANDARD ONE WITH BUTTON
EVEN IF WE HAVE A L. C. D. DISPLAY
OKAY YEAH
OKAY SO WE CAN TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT
SO WHO THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GO FOR UH LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH IT WILL
EUROS
YEAH YEAH
WELL EACH UNIT IS IS SELL UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS
BECAUSE WE ARE
IT SEEMS THAT THAT WE WANT TO SELL LIKE FOUR MILLION UNITS FROM THE FIRST MEETING
OKAY
MAYBE WE CAN UH WE CAN LOOK AT THE NEW REQUIREMENT I RECEIVE FROM THE MANAGEMENT BOARD AND DISCUS DISCUSS ALL FUNCTION WE WANT TO HAVE
YEAH I I WILL CONTINUE
WELL ASK YOUR QUESTION IF YOU WANT
OKAY
IT'S NOT INTUITIVE FIRST
YEAH
BUT BUT ALSO IT SEEMS THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE IT WOULD BE MORE COMPLEX TO CONFIGURE IT TO BE SIMPLE THAN CREATING A SIMPLE PRODUCT
YEAH
BUT ALSO WE WE SEE THAT THAT MOST PEOPLE FIND IT FIND REMOTE CONTROLS TOO COMPLEX BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS AND THEY MAINLY USE ONLY CHANNELS AND VOLUME BUTTONS
SO WE MAY JUST UH MAKE A VERY EASY TO USE REMOTE CONTROL WITH MAINLY THOSE BUTTONS AND MAYBE ALSO UM
SOME LIGHTNING STUFF TOO
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE FIND ALSO HARD TO TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL
LOSED LOSE IT ETCETERA
THESE THESE ARE THESE TWO POINTS ARE THE MAIN FRUSTRATIONS SO MAYBE IF WE DESIGN SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE AND EASY TO UH FIND WHEN LOST IT WILL UH ADD UH A SERIOUS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
WITHOUT MAKING SOMETHING TOO COMPLEX AND TOO LONG TO DEVELOP
SO BUT LE LET US SEE FIRST THE NEW REQUIREMENT
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO SO THIS THIS UH IS UH IS UM IN THE THIS IS IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS WE WERE SPEAKING SO WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A VERY COMPLEX REMOTE CONTROLS TO ACCESS TELETEXT AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO DEFINE THE BUTTONS TO SURF AMONGST PAGES AND STUFF
YEAH
SO WELL
YEAH
SO ANYWAY WE DON'T HAVE TO INCLUDE THIS FEATURE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT USED ANY MORE BY USERS THEY PREFER TO S
YEAH
I DUNNO
IF I ONE BUTTON IS STILL ONE MORE BUTTON
IF IF IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE WE HAVE TO REDUCE NUMBER OF BUTTONS COMPARED TO TH TO OUR COMPETITORS
WELL ANYWAY I HAVE THIS POINT
WE CAN DISCUSS
ALSO UM SO AS AS I TOLD BEFORE UH IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT'S ONLY FOR THE T. V. UM
BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE QUICK ON ON THE MARKET
AND THEN ALSO WE HAVE TO MAKE VERY UH UH CLEAR THAT THIS UH
THIS REMOTE CONTROL IS IS PART OF OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SHOW OUR CORPORATE UH LOGO AND AND COLOURS ON THE ON THE DESIGN AS WELL SO THAT UH THEY IDENTIFY IT AS ONE OF OUR PRODUCT
SO THIS IS THE THE KEY POINT
SO BEFORE UH FINISHING WE CAN UH DEFINE UH WHAT WOULD BE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE O TH OF THE CONTROL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WHICH BUTTON DO WE NEED WHICH FUNCTION DO WE WANT ETCETERA
SO
DO YOU UM SO SO FROM FROM THE THE MARKETING EXPERT I THINK
A KEY ASPECT IS THE EASY TO USE ASPECT
IT SHOULD BE VERY SIMPLE AND MOST BUTTON ARE NEVER USED ONLY TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTON ARE ARE USED OFTEN SO I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON THAT POINT
NO
YEAH OKAY
SO YEAH THE KEY POINT HERE IS SIMPLE
MAYBE
SO FEW BUTTONS CHANNEL
VOLUME CONTROL
AND WHAT EL WHAT FUNCTION DO YOU SEE
IN ADDITION TO THAT
YEAH
MAYBE SWITCH T. V. ON AND OFF
YEAH
YEAH
VOLUME MAYBE A MUTE BUTTON AND THEN ON OFF BUTTON
AND THAT'S ALL
MM
OKAY
YEAH THIS IS COOL
MAYBE WE CAN INCLUDE THAT ALSO
PREVIOUS PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON
SO WE HAVE LIKE CHANNEL BUTTON THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON THE VOLUME BUTTON PLUS A MUTE BUTTON AND UH JUST THE THE TRADITIONAL ON OFF BUTTON
YEAH
I I TALK ABOUT THAT YEAH
YEAH
INCREMENTAL DEFINITELY BECAUSE ZAPPING YOU YOU SWITCH THEM
WE GO FASTER
MM
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE ALSO A DIGIT BUTTON
YEAH
MAYBE WE HAVE ALSO TO HAVE DIGITS OR ONLY INCREMENTAL
I DUNNO BEC BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THE
UH
YEAH
BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON IF YOU HAVE INCREMENTAL ONLY IT'S NOT UH IT ISN'T WORTH IT BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL IS EITH EITHER MINUS ONE OR PLUS ONE
SO I THINK WE NEED ALSO DIGITS
MAYBE WE WE CAN MAKE VERY OBVIOUS THE CHANNEL AND VOLUME BUTTON BUTTON AND SMALLER BUTTON DOWN THERE WITH THE THE DIGITS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A WHEEL FOR INCREMENTAL
OKAY
SO HAVE A WHEEL FOR INCREMENTAL HAVE THE DIGITS UH ON THE LOWER SIDE THAT CAN BE CLOSED SO AS YOU SAY PROTECTED
AND UH YEAH I THINK THIS IS THE BASI
AND DO WE DO WE HAVE A
NO A WHEEL IS BETTER
I WOULD SAY THE WHEEL IS BETTER
WHAT IS THE EXPERT OF UH
OKAY
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
WELL ALSO WE HAVE TO DECIDE UH SO IT SHOULD BE LIGHTENING IN THE DARK I THINK BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE LOST THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
YEAH AND DO WE PUT AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
BECAUSE IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG CUSTOMERS IF YOU REMEMBER
OKAY
SO NO L. C. D.
AND SO NO SPEECH AS WELL BECAUSE IT W IT WOULD DELAY TOO MUCH THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
YEAH
THAT WOULD BE COOL
BUT EIGHT MONTHS IS REALLY LONG AND
MAYBE WE CAN JUST UH
OKAY
SO UM I I WILL UH I WILL SO I WE WILL MOVE TO NEXT MEETING SO IN AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK UH HERE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL UH ACTION UH YOU ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUT YOU WILL BE UH RECALLED TO THE ACTIONS BY UH EMAIL I THINK BUT YOU CAN TAKE NOTES IF YOU IF YOU WANT BUT WELL THE INSTRUCTION WILL BE SENT
SO
THANK YOU FOR UH YOUR SUGGESTION AND I I WILL MAKE A SUMMARY OF THAT MEETING THAT I WILL PUT IN THE SHARED FOLDER YOU CAN'T SEE AND UH AND THEN YOU WILL UM YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN UH HAS BEEN SAID ON ON THIS MEETING AND AND WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED
UH MAYBE FOR NEXT MEETING UH SEND ME YOUR PRESENTATION BEFORE BY EMAIL SO THAT WE CAN SEE THEM UH ALTOGETHER
THAT WOULD BE EASIER
NO IT DID NOT WORK
SHE SEND IT TO ME BY EMAIL
SO MAYBE THIS IS BETTER TO SEND IT BY EMAIL
OKAY
SO YEAH I I'M IT'S IN THE FIRST UH EMAIL SO I'M PARTICIPANT ONE AT AMI UH WHERE IS THAT IT'S HERE
PARTICIPANT ONE AT AMI
OKAY
SO SEE YOU AFTER LUNCH BREAK
HELLO
MAKE A START YEAH
SO
CABLE CAMERA
SHOULD BE IN MY IN THEIR FOLDER NO
UP
UM AT THREE I THINK
NO
MM
DO WE THINK W S IN THE IN THE WRONG FOLDER MAYBE
IT IS POSSIBLE
IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS
I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME ACTUALLY MUST BE SOMETHING LIKE MESSENGER AMI OR SOMETHING
GO UP
YEAH GO UP
AGAIN
NO
GO BACK
UH MAYBE MESSENGER AMI
MESSENGER
NO
THERE IS NOTHING
LET'S GO AND CHECK
I'LL GO AND CHECK
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
SO UH
BASICALLY WHAT WE WANT HERE IS A REMOTE CONTROL RIGHT
SO UM THE QUESTION WELL FIRST OF ALL WHAT TO CONTROL
SO MOST PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A A REMOTE FOR THEIR HI FI AND T. V. AND STUFF LIKE THAT
AND BUT OTHER PEOPLE WANT TH ALSO REMOTES FOR CONTROLLING UH AND TOYS LIKE ROBOTIC PETS AND LITTLE ROBOTS AND STUFF AND OTHER PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO HAVE REMOTES FOR CONTROLLING UM WHOLE HOUSE
YEAH SO THERE'S A PROJECT I THINK CALLED X. HOUSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT DOES THAT UH YOU CAN INTEGRATE YOUR REMOTE WITH UH COMPUTERS STUFF
SO THERE IS ONE THAT IS ONE THING
THE OTHER IS THE
THE FINDER FEATURE YEAH BY WHISTLING OR WHATEVER
UH IF YOU HAVE THE FINDER FEATURE THEN YOU CAN ALSO HAVE
UH AT THE SAME TIME AS AND GENERAL VOICE COMMANDS IF YOU WANT YEAH
SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE A PACKAGE IN THAT CASE
UH SO THE USER INTERFACE WILL CONSIST OF TWO PARTS
ONE IS THE VOICE COMMAND PART AND ON ONE IS THE ACTUAL BUTTONS PART
UH AND TH THE BUTTONS PART WOULD BE UH A SET OF BUTTONS FOR CHOOSING DEVICES A SET OF BUTTONS FOR SPECIAL NAVIGATION IN SPACE
A SET OF BUTTONS FOR LINEAR ACCESS OF MEDIUM AND A SET OF BUTTONS FOR RANDOM ACCESS
YEAH
LIKE A VIDEO TAPE GOES FORWARD BACKWARDS UH FAST AND STUFF YEAH
UM
MM
YEAH
FOR SPECIAL NAVIGATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT HAVE A T. V. IN THE MENU AND YOU GOING TO CHANGE YEAH
UH
MM
YEAH AND ALSO PARAMETER CHANGING
SO IF THERE ARE COMMON PARAMETERS MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT SPECIAL BUTTONS FOR THAT UM OR MAYBE WE COULD HAVE EVERYTHING UH GENERIC BUT UH THERE ARE A LOT OF UH REMOTES ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW AND BASICALLY THIS IS MOST OF THE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS THIS STUFF
VOICE COMMAND W WE COULD SPECIFY ANYTHING
WE COULD ASSIGN ANY BUTTON A COMMAND TO ANY BUTTON IF WE HAVE ENOUGH PROCESSING POWER I GUESS SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH YEAH I THINK SO
NOT SO FAR
WHERE DID YOU PUT IT
MM
I'M DESIGNING THE USER INTERFACE
BUT WHAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROLS DID YOU LOOK AT
WHAT KIND OF TASK WAS IT
IT WAS A T. V.
HUH
UH-HUH
AH GOOD
OTHER SIDE YEAH YO WA YOUR WRIST
IT I CAN BECOME PAINFUL YOU CAN HAVE TENDONDITIS
YEAH
IF YOU ALSO UP ON A COMPUTER IN A STRANGE POSITION
ERGONOMIC
BUT UH
HAVE TO SAY HA HA
MM-HMM
THE FIRST QUESTION
MM
MM
MM I IT'S NOT TRUE I THINK
THE THE SECOND CLAIM THAT YOU PUT
YEAH
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE SAME
I HAVE UH I'VE NO IDEA I MEAN I SHOULD KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT HOW FAST WE CAN UH DESIGN IT
I DON'T THINK
UH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE A YOU FEEL A BIT LIKE A DOG WITH THIS STUFF
THIS WILL THINK THIS WILL TAKE MORE TIME TO DEVELOP ALSO
YEAH
SOON
YEAH
SO THE ONLY TIME PROBLEM IS THE SP VOICE RECOGNITION
YEAH
YEAH
TEN YEARS
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO MARKET
I THINK WE SHOULD CONTACT MANAGEMENT
WELL
UH
HOW MUC HOW MUCH DO YOU GET HOW MUCH DO YOU IF YOU BUY ONE MILLION UNITS H NO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS
EH CHIPS
WE'RE GONNA NEED CHIPS RIGHT
YEAH
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
OKAY
SO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA FOR A POWERFUL ONE THAT HAS UH GOOD ENOUGH FOR DO SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH
OKAY
SO
NO IT DOESN'T
OKAY
FOUR MILLION
MH HMM
A A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UH IF YOU HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN IF YOU CAN DO IT COMPLETELY THE WAY YOU WANT BECAUSE THE BUTTONS ALSO LOOK THE WAY YOU WANT THEM BUT IT WILL BE HARD TO CONFIGURE I MEAN IMAGINE I UH SO IT'S REALLY SOMETHING FOR THE EXPERT USER
SO
I MEAN THERE ARE MARKETS AND MARKETS
I THINK THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TH UH ARE UH CHRISTINE HERE SAID UH YOU HAVE A UH IT IS YEAH
SO FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE UH IT WILL BE COOL THEY CAN BE ABLE TO USE IT
TH MAYBE THEIR PARENTS WILL NOT BUT THEY WILL CONFIGURE IT
I GUESS
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS STUDY ABOUT THAT
MM
AND THERE ARE ANOTHER THING IS THAT IF WE MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE THAT'S BAS TO USE IMMEDIATELY THAT MEANS THAT IT WILL BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVERYTHING ELSE
ALL RIGHT
OTHERWISE IF IT'S DIFFERENT THEN OF COURSE EVERYBODY HAS SOMEBODY HAS TO LEARN TO USE IT FIRST
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT TELETEXT IS JUST ONE BUTTON
YOU YOU JUST WRITE THE WRITE THE NUMBERS
SO WILL YOU ADD WITH THE CHANNEL KEYS RIGHT
SO
I AM
I'M SURE THAT UH IT DON'T LIKE BUT UH I DON'T SEE JUST ONE BUTTON
SO
MM-HMM
CAPITAL
WELL IF IT IS GOING TO BE JUST A T. V. REMOTE CONTROL IT IS GOING TO BE VERY SIMPLE
WELL IF IT'S GOING TO BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE THEN JUST HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL THERE IS NO OTHER FUNCTION THAT I CAN SEE
REALLY
UH NO YOU WANT TO KEEP TELEVISION ON SO THAT THE ADVERTISING CAN REVENUE CAN COME BACK TO US
OR SOMETHING
IT'S A MEMORY YEAH
AND UH AND OF COURSE THE CHANNEL CHANGING BUTTONS
HOW SHOULD THEY HOW SHOULD WE IMPLEMENT THAT
BECAUSE UH COULD BE NUMERICAL ONLY OR COULD BE ALSO INCREMENTAL
MM-HMM
MM
IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA THAT IF YOU PRESS IT FOR A LONG TIME IT DOES SOMETHING ELSE IN GENERAL
SO IF YOU YOU HAVE YOUR TEN BUTTONS FOR THE FOR THE NUMERIC THE NUMERICAL BUTTONS AND YOU HAVE INSTEAD OF HAVING JUST ONE MEMORY
YOU HAVE IF YOU PRESS THEM FOR A LONG TIME
NO
DOESN'T WORK DOES IT
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A COMPLETE KEYBOARD AND JUST TYPE CONSOLE COMMANDS
CHANGE CHANNEL TO EIGHT
NO
WELL IF IT'S USEFUL LIKE IF IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE BETWEEN THREE CHANNELS FOR EXAMPLE THEN YOU H YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT CANNOT WORK WITH JUST MEMORY BEING INCREMENTAL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WHEN YOU ZAP USUALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO PRESS THE SAME BUTTON ALL THE TIME AND
YEAH
MM-HMM
HEY I JUST THOUGHT THIS THING THERE IS A I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE IS ARE SOME WITH A WHEEL LIKE THIS
INSTEAD OF HAVING THE UP DOWN BUTTONS FOR UH YOU CAN HAVE THE WHEEL
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
ON THE LOWER SIDE I THINK IT YOU HAVE TO TURN IT
NO
IF WE DO THAT
YEAH
BECAUSE OF THAT
BECAUSE IT'S UH IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE A VOLUME WHICH IS SMOOTH YEAH
THE CHANNELS CHANGE ONE BY ONE
SO YOU HAVE TO THE USER HAS TO LIKE TO SHOULD FEEL THE THE THE DISCRETE SENSE A BIT
YEAH
YEAH
EVEN IF I L. E. D. UH OR A IF IF IT'S THE L. C. D. FEATURE UH WHATEVER YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT'S ONLY PUT ON IF COU HAVE MULTI FUNCTION
IF YOU DO NOT MULTI FUNCTION THEN THERE IS NO P POINT IN HAVING L. C. D.
JUST INCREASE THE COST
THE USER DOES NOT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE REALLY
WELL IF IT'S GOING TO DELAY YEAH BUT UH IT WILL BE COOL
IT WOULD
BECAUSE A USER COULD SAY C. N. N. FOR EXAMPLE AND IT WOULD GO C. N. N.
MM
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT IS THE FOLDER THAT YOU PUT YOURS IN
AND DID IT IT DID WORK
AH YEAH
MM
OKAY
OKAY WHAT IS YOUR EMAIL
AT PARTICIPANT ONE
OKAY
WELL DURING LUNCH BREAK ACTUALLY
SO NEXT TIME WE SHOULD HAVE A FIGHT
HOW ABOUT UH MANAGEMENT OR SOMETHING
WHO HAPPENS TO BE YOUR FRIEND
OKAY
F DO YOU WANT TO START
OKAY
NO
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN SHORT CUT
PARTICIPANT TWO
YEAH
OTHERWISE COULD YOU JUST DESCRIBE
BY HAND
WITH THE THE WHITEBOARD
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY LINEAR ACCESS THEN
AH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I'M JUST THINKING OF SOME THING
UM
WE WANT TO HAVE A NO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A GOOD IDEA
WE WANT TO HAVE A A GENERAL REMOTE CONTROL FOR EVERYTHING
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
NO NO
FINISH TONIGHT
BUT BASICALLY YEAH MAYBE I CAN CONTINUE WITH MY PRESENTATION IT WOULD BE AL YOU YOU BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME TECHNICAL PROBLEM OR SO
SO I'M JUST GOING TO DESCRIBE BRIEFLY WHAT WE DO IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
IF FACT
YEAH BUT
DO I HAVE OH YEAH
NOW I HAVE ENOUGH CABLES
OKAY SO I'M JUST GOING TO DESCRIBE IN FACT FOR FOR A REMOTE CONTROL THIS IS QUITE EASY
WE JUST HAVE SORRY I'M GOING
LIKE THAT
I'M JUST GOING TO DESCRIBE
BASICALLY WE HAVE A A BATTERY A POWER SUPPLY HERE
AFTER THAT WE JUST HAVE UM USER INTERFACE
LET'S SAY THAT
UM
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH COULD BE UM A L. C. D. LET'S SAY OR UM AN ARRAY OF PUSH BUTTON SOMETHING LIKE THAT
PUSH BUTTON OR A L. C. D.
AFTER THAT WE WE FEED THAT INTO UM
UH AN ELECTRONIC CHIP
SO I SAY U. C. AND I FEED THAT TO UH L. E. D. WHICH IS UH INFRARED UM WHICH IS A AN INFRARED UM COMPONENT
AND SO WHAT WE FOR FOR MYSELF THIS FOR FOR US THIS IS QUITE EASY
YEAH
Y IT'S A IT'S THIS JUST A CHIP WHICH DOES ALL THE UM NUMERICAL
NUMERICAL COMPUTATION ACCORDING TO YOUR DISPLAY
AND SO FOR US UH THIS IS QUITE EASY
WE JUST NEED TO TAKE TO DEFINE WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHEN THE USER INTERFACE UM WANTS SOMETHING AND AFTER THAT WE JUST DO THE CODING TO S AND SEND THAT TO TO TO THE NOT THE TO THE TELEVISION
SO FOR US THIS IS QUITE EASY
YEAH
UM WE JUST HAVE TO DEFINE THE PROCESSING POWER THAT WE NEED UH ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT TO DO SOME UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
IN THAT CASE THAT MEAN THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE MORE FOR SIMPLE
YEAH OF COURSE OF COURSE
AND UM BUT FOR A STANDARD ONE THIS IS REALLY EASY
IT'S A QUESTION OF ONE MONTH AND SO ON S
NO NO NO NO I SAY YEAH STANDARD UH STANDARD REMOTE CONTROL TAKES MAYBE UH ONE MONTH TO TO DO THAT
YEAH
DEFINITELY
I WOULD SAY
I WOULD SAY UH ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS TO HAVE THE FIRST RESULTS
YEAH
I CAN
UM
YEAH
YEAH EVEN
I MEAN THAT THIS IS REALLY STANDARD DEVICES NOW
UM EIGHT
FOR UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND ALSO HOW MUCH UH I THINK
DURING THE KICKOFF MEETING YOU SAY THAT WE WE SHOULDN'T WE SHOULDN'T GO UP TO TWELVE POINT FIVE EURO PER UNIT SO HOW MANY UNITS SHOULD WE SELL TO HAVE A
YEAH BUT HOW MANY YEAH
YEAH
USUALLY THIS IS LESS THA AT TWO DOLLARS PER CHIP
YEAH WE CAN
MM-HMM
UM
I JUST HAD A QUESTION UH DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WITH YOUR PRESENTA
IS IT
UM YOU SAY THAT I DON'T REMEMBER BY HEART BUT THIRTY PER CENT
OF THE TESTED PEOPLE SAY THAT'S IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO TO TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL
DO THEY SAY THAT THIS IS DIFFICULT BUT FOR THE SAME REASON OR DO THEY HAVE OTHER REASON
TO TO MAYBE TO KEEP IN MIND MAYBE TO ACCESS TO THAT MENU YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND
BUT YEAH MAYBE AND WHAT ABOUT IF WE DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH CAN BE CONFIGURE AS YOU WANT
YOU SAY THAT I WANT I HAVE SIX BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
UH I KNOW THAT SOM YOU SAY THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING PLENTY OF A LOT OF ZAPPING
I KNOW THA I DISCOVERED THAT WHEN I DID A QUICK LOOK UH THEY DO NOW SOM THEY DO SOMETHING WHICH IS QUITE NICE NOW
YOU HAVE A BUTTON YOU YOU PRESS IT AND THIS IS UH THE PREVIOUS CHANNEL WHICH HAS COME BACK
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
LET'S SAY THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THIS IS UH INCREMENTAL BUT ONCE YOU PRESS IT FOR A LONG TIME YOU GO FIVE BY FIVE
TO GO FA TO GO FASTER
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OR WE CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE CAN DESIGN THE REMOTE CONTROL TO HAVE ACCESS
YOU KNOW SOME REMOTE CONTROL HAVE UH PROTECTION AND SO YOU YOU Y
YOU
YEAH A KIND OF JOYSTICK
MM-HMM
OR A OR A BALL YEAH NOT A A WHEEL BUT A BALL AND YOU SAY UH TO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THE YEAH
'S QUITE IT'S QUITE EASY WE DO THAT W WITH BACK LIGHT ON THE ON THE WHEEL
A BLUE A BLUE L. E. D. AND WE SELL THAT UM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
TEN YEARS
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM
YEAH
UM I DUNNO IF YOU CAN OPEN THE UH M IS NOT HERE
UH IN
YEAH OKAY
NO
IN DOCUMENT
MM COMPUTER YEAH
HERE
HERE
BUT IT'S NOT
UM
MM-HMM
YEAH I CAN DO THAT
OKAY
UM
IT'S PARTICIPANT ONE
OKAY
YOU CAN UH
YEAH
OKAY SO YOU CAN YOU CAN GO
OKAY SO IN OUR USABILITY LAB WE OBSERVED THE REMOTE CONTROL USE AMONG ONE HUNDRED SUBJECTS AND THE SUBJECTS ALSO FILLED A QUESTIONNAIRE OKAY
AND HERE I HAVE THE RESULTS SO YOU CAN SEE THAT UM SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY SO WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM MORE
MORE NICE MORE KIND
EIGHTY PER CENTS OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY
EIGHTY HUNDRED PER CENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK OH TO IT'S NOT GOOD
SO OKAY
SO IT'S NOT IN THEORY BUT I I CAN I CAN SAY YEAH
FIFTY F UH SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF USERS SAY THEY S ZAP A LOT
SO MM WE HAVE TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL UH VERY UM OUT FOR THAT
UH THE BUTTONS HAVE ARE TO BE UM UH UH LIKE YOU SAY RESIST RESISTING TO TO SHOCKS
UM AND FIFTY PER CENTS OF USERS SAY THEY ONLY USE UH TEN PER CENTS OF BUT OF THE BUTTONS IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO ALL THE BUTTONS WE WE HAVE TO PUT ARE HAVE TO TO HAVE UM A USE A REAL USE AND NOT ONLY OR
YEAH
F NOT MANY BUTTONS AND UH AND UH UH U USEABLE BUTTONS
SORRY
YEAH
UH MOST FOR MOST IS T. V.
'KAY YOU CAN GO SO
SO THERE ARE OTHER FRUSTRATIONS EXPRESSED BY USERS
SO THEY SAID UH THEY LOST UH OFTEN THE REMOTE CONTROL IN IN THE ROOM SO THEY WANT TO HAVE A WAY TO TO
TO FIND IT
UM AND UM LOT OF THE TIME THEY IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
SO THEY WANT SOMETHING S REALLY VERY SIMPLE AND UH EASY TO USE
AND UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE BAD FOR
R. S. I. UM
I DUNNO
YEAH
UH
OKAY UM BEFORE THAT I I HAVE SOME SOME SOME THING UH TO SAY BEFORE UM
WE KNOW THAT UH THE USER USE UH A LOT THEIR UM REMOTE CONTROL UM TO TO CHANGE CHANNEL
UM AND UM TO TO CHANGE UH VOLUME SELECTION OF THE AND UH AND NOT UH A LOT FOR SETTING FOR SETTING THE THE CHANNELS AND UH THING THINGS LIKE THAT
SO IT'S BETTER TO PUT UH UH UH SOMETHING VERY EASY TO SET AND UH AND
VERY ACCESSIBLE YES
THAT'S RIGHT
SO THEN WE ASKED SOME QUESTIONS TO THEM AND UM WE ASKED THIS QUESTION IF THEY PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN OR ON THEIR REMULTIFIC FUNCTION REMOTES CONTROL AND IF THEY MM PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN REMOTE CONTROL AND YOU CAN GO WE HAVE HERE THE RESULTS OF
OF THE QUESTIONS
SO YOU KNOW THAT UM
FOR THE YOUNGER IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO HAVE THE S YES AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND UH AND THE OTHERS IS NOT SO IMPORTANT BUT UH WE KNOW THAT UH UH PEOPLE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE ARE PEOPLE WHO WATCH A LOT T. V. AND UH WHO WHO WH CAN USE A LOT THIS UH
SO MAYBE WE WE CAN HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION IN
YEAH
MM
OKAY AND IF THERE IS TH THE CONCLUSION NOW
SO AS WE SAY BEFORE I THINK UH UM A REMOTE CONTROL LIGHTENING IN THE DARK IT'S IT'S A GOOD THING
UH NOT TO MANY MUD BUTTONS LIKE WE WE SAID BEFORE
E EASY TO USE UH A WAY TO FIND IT EASILY IN THE ROOM AND UH UH RESISTANT TO TO SHOCK AND TO TO
AN I S NO YEAH
I DUNNO IF YOU SEE SOMETHING ELSE IMPORTANT OR
MM
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
YEAH
OH
WOULD J
UH YEAH W I I THINK THEY THEY SAY THAT IT'S UH DIFFICULT TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT BUT I WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT
IT'S IT'S OKAY
BUT
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM-HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
MM
NO
NO NO
I DUNNO I DUNNO IT
'KAY THANK YOU
OKAY
SO WE ARE HERE FOR THE CONCEPT DESIGN MEETING
SO WE WILL FIRST START BY SUMMARIZING THE MM THE PREVIOUS MEETING AND THE DECISION WE'VE TAKEN
UH I WILL TAKE NOTES DURING THIS MEETING SO UH THAT YOU CAN UH LOOK AT MY UH FOLDER TO SEE THE SUMMARY OF THIS MEETING AFTERWARDS
SO EACH OF YOU WILL UH SHOW US THE VARIOUS INVESTIGATION THEY'VE DONE DURING UH PREVIOUS UH HOURS
WE'LL THEN T TAKE DECISION IN CONCERT AND THEN UH UH WE WILL UH DEFINE THE NEST NEXT TASK TO HAVE TO BE DONE BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING
SO LAST TIME WE DECIDED TO HAVE A SIMPLE INTERFACE
WE ALSO DECIDED TO HAVE A WHEEL TO CHANGE CHANNEL PREVIOUS CHANNEL BUTTON
CHANNEL DIGIT UH BUTTONS SHOULD BE UH PROTECTED BY PLASTIC COVER OR SOMETHING FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO LOOK VERY SIMPLE
WE HAVE ALSO BUTTON FOR VOLUME AND TO SWITCH ON OFF THE T. V.
WE HAVE ALSO UH THE LIGHTENING FEATURE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE EASY TO FIND
AND FOR FAST DEVELOPMENT AND LOW COST WE HAVE DECIDED TO HAVE NO L. C. D. NO VOICE FEATURES
SO NOW UH WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS
SO THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION BY INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER THE SPECIFICATION OF THE U. I. BY OR U. I. OKAY
AND UH THE LAST POINT IS UH TREND WATCHING BY MARKET EXPERT
SO MAYBE WE CAN START WITH UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
SO THIS IS THE PRESENTATION
MAYBE I CAN SWITCH SLIDE UH ON YOUR REQUEST
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
BUT IS IT A SIGNIFICANT PRICE ON THE WHOLE REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE WE CAN AFFORD UP TO TWELVE EUROS FOR THE PRICE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO WILL WILL WILL THIS WITH UH INCLUDING ALL POSSIBLE THINGS SO BUTTONS WHEEL AND THE CHIP BE UH LOWER THAN TWELVE EUROS TO PRODUCE
OKAY
YOU RECEIVED SOMETHING
HMM
AND COULD IT BE ADAPTED
OKAY AND THERE CAN UH RECOGNIZE SOME COMMANDS AND STUFF
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY MAYBE WE CAN JUST UH LISTEN TO THIS PRESENTATION AND THEN TAKE DECISION LATER ON ACCORDING TO THOSE NEWS
OKAY
YOU CAN EASILY FIND THE BUTTON IN THE DARK OR SO
IT WILL BE TURNED ON WHEN THE WHEN THE USER MOVE THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK NO
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
TRUE
BUT IT CAN BE UH BATTERY CONSUMING NO
TO HAVE THE LIGHT ALWAYS ON
WELL WE WILL DISCUSS THAT AFTER MAYBE
THE OTHER PRESENTATIONS
YEAH
AND IT IS
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND ALSO DOES IT UH FIT WELL IN HAND
BECAUSE IT WAS UH TH YOUR WRIST PROBLEM WITH THE USAGE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT'S ONLY THE CENTRAL PART
YEAH
WITH A MAYBE A MORE ERGONOMIC DESIGN ON ON THE BOTTOM PART
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
S
OKAY
WILL BE DOWN OR OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM
YEAH
MAYBE THE WHEEL WILL BE A GOOD ADVANTAGE OVER OUR COMPETITORS
BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S PRETTY STANDARD APART THE FACT THAT IT'S VERY SIMPLE
SO MAYBE IT'S WORSE TO UH TO HAVE MORE EXPENSE ON THAT'S THAT ASPECT
OKAY
SO WE CAN MOVE TO THE IS THERE ANY QUESTION
FOR
DESIGNER OF USER INTERFACE
OR WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT PART MAYBE AND DISCUSS AFTERWARDS
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
THIS IS GOOD ALSO FOR
YEAH
I THINK IT IS GOOD ALSO F TO HAVE A SPONGY MATERIAL YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE IT'S ROBUST
YEAH UH SORRY
NO
YEAH
BEFORE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT'S INNOVATIVE TO USE THE MM THE WHEEL BECAUSE I THINK NO ONE ELSE HAS
HAS IT
YEAH
I THINK IT'S IT MAKES IT BOTH EASY AND BOTH INNOS INNOVATIVE
SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD ASPECT AND IT SHOULD BE KEPT
COOL FANCY
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT L LOOK LIKE A FRUIT OR VEGETABLE
MAYBE UH UM A COLOUR THAT REMEMBER SOME FRUIT UH THINGS LIKE THAT
MAYBE YEAH
YEAH AND IT'S ERGONOMIC AS WELL
A PEAR
YEAH
MAYBE PEAR YEAH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
WE CAN DISCUSS THAT UH
D D IS IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD
I DON'T THINK SO
I THINK WE WE CAN HAVE LIKE YEAH A PEAR IS GOOD FIT WELL OR BANANA AS YOU TOLD
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT THAT'S NOT IN THE TREND
THE TREND IS SPONGY AND VEGETABLE FRUITS
I THINK P SPONGY IS GOOD BECAUSE IT IT WILL BE ROBUST AS WELL
SO I THINK WE CAN KEEP THE WHEEL
BECAUSE IT'S UH EASY IT'S INNOVATIVE EVEN IF THE COST IS A BIT HIGHER AND WE ALSO HAVE TO FIND A
SO A FRUIT LIKE PEAR OR BANANA WIT UH ANY OTHERS IDEA YOU HAVE
WHAT KIND OF FR FRUIT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TO CONTROL YOUR T. V. WITH
ODI
BANANA IS ALSO YELLOW SO YOU YOU CAN'T LOST YOUR REMOTE CONTROL THEN
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT'S A GOOD DESIGN AND IT'S INNOVATIVE AS WELL THEN
MAYBE WE CAN KEEP THE BANANA
AND IT WILL BE VERY EASY TO FIND
YEAH
YEAH IT'S REALLY UH REALLY A GOOD POINT
I THINK IT SO
ONE SECOND
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE SOME DECISION ON THIS ASPECT
SO UH SO FOR
SORRY FOR UH COMPONENT SO
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE ASPECTS SORRY
YEAH
I THINK IT'S THE BOX THAT SHOULD BE SPONGY BANANA'S SHAPE
BUT
NO THE BUTTON WOULD BE IN FACT IT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING ODD SHAPED WITH A SPONGY COVER
OKAY ODD SHAPE WITH SPONGY
COVER
AND STANDARD BATTERY OKAY A CHIP IMPRINT THERE'S NO SPECIFIC PROBLEM
SO WE AGREE TO PUT THE WHEEL
SO IT HAVE TO IT HAS TO BE SYMMETRICAL
YEAH MAYBE THE THUMB IS MORE COMFORTABLE
YEAH I THINK IT'S OKAY FOR BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT
MM
I THINK YOU CAN TURN IT THIS WAY ALSO
YOU CAN DO BOTH WITH BOTH HANDS
I THINK IT'S OKAY
WELL YOU YOU WILL GET USED TO IT
AND MOREOVER TH THE BUTTON AR ARE LIGHTED SO YOU YOU IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY THE RIGHT SIDE BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIGHT ON BUTTONS
YEAH
NO YOU YOU I THINK YOU WILL USE IT ONLY ON THE RIGHT OR LEFT HAND WHETHER YOU ARE RIGHTY OR LEFTY
I THINK FOR LEFTY IT'S OKAY
I CAN DO THIS MOVEMENT AND FOR RIGHTY AS WELL
I THINK THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THAT MUCH
YEAH
SO FOR INTERFACE WE SAID ALSO THAT WE HAVE UH THIS BANANA SHAPE WITH BUTTON ON THE S ON THE SIDE
AND
AND UH A WHEEL ON THE TOP
SO THE COLOUR IS YELLOW
I THINK IT'S UH WE DEFINED EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO
WHAT WE SHOULD WHAT THE DECISION WE SHOULD TAKE YEAH
SO MAYBE WE CAN UM
WE CAN UH WORK ON THOSE ASPECTS UH UNTIL NEXT MEETING
SO HAVE THE FINAL UH LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN ACCORDING TO THE DECISION
AND HAVE THE THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND UH THEN EVALUATE THE PRODYUC THE PRODUCT
THAT IS TO SAY UH CHECK IF IT FIT THE THE REQUIREMENT UH GIVEN BY THE USERS BUT ACCORDING TO UH YOUR PRESENTATION IT SEEMS TO BE OKAY
IT SEEMS TO BE FANCY INNOVATIVE AND EASY TO USE
SO
SO
TO PREPARE THE PROTOTYPE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER UH WORK TOGETHER
THAT WOULD UH
BE BETTER I THINK
AND UH
AND SO UH
YOU WILL RECEIVE FURTHER INSTRUCTION BY EMAILS AS USUAL
SO DO YOU NEED TO ADD ANYTHING
YOU FEEL OKAY
YOU FEEL UH FREE TO EXPRESS WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY
YOU DON'T FEEL TOO CONSTRAINED
YOU DON'T FEEL FREE TO ANSWER THIS
OKAY SO
SEE YOU
UH I. D. YOU WANT
YEAH
I ONLY V HAVE THREE SLIDES SO
I JUST LOOK AT THE MM
UM JUST THIS
ON SOME WEB PAGES TO FIND SOME DOCUMENTATION AND I THINK A REMOTE CONTROL IS AS I S MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY
YOU JUST HAVE A A VERY SIMPLE CHIP AND THE MM THE USER INTERFACE IS JUST DONE USUALLY BY PUSH BUTTON
AND IN OUR CASE WE ARE USING A UM A WHEEL CONTROL
SO UH UH I WAS LOOKING BASICALLY FOR THAT CHIP
WHICH IS UH VERY VERY STANDARD AND UH I JUST LOOKED FOR THE WHEEL SENSOR AND THE STANDARD PUSH BUTTON
AND UM YEAH WE CAN CHANGE DIRECTLY
IN FACT I HAVE THE NUMBER OF THAT ELEMENT WHICH IS VERY STANDARD FOR REMOTE CONTROL
THE PUSH BUTTON ARE USUALLY EXTREMELY CHEAP BUT I JUST HAVE ONE PROBLEM AND THIS IS RELATED WITH THE WHEEL SENSOR WHICH SEEMS TO BE QUITE EXPENSIVE
AND I THINK WE IF WE COULD JUST TALK ABOUT THAT IF WE REALLY NEED A WHEEL SENSOR OR IF WE CAN NOT IF IF WE COULD COMBINE SOMETHING WITH THE PUSH BUTTON
UH A WHEEL SENSOR IS FIFTY TIME THE PRICE OF A A A PUSH BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH I I TH
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT UH WE SHOULD
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT UH THE DESIGN OF THE BOX ALSO WHICH NEEDS SOME MONEY
BUT
UM THAT'S ALL YEAH
I HAVEN'T CHEC
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT I THINK IT'S YEAH SORRY I HAVEN'T WRITTEN MY PERSONAL REFERENCES
UM THE I I JUST WANT TO MENTION THE THE PROBLEM OF THE THE R
WHEELS SENSOR WHICH IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ANY PUSH BUTTON AND IF WE COULD REDUCE THAT
WE WE HAVE ALREADY SOME GOOD THINGS UH WITH UM UM WITH THE BACKLIGHT OF THE PUSH BUTTON
JUST TO TO MAKE SOMETHING WHICH IS UH SLIGHTLY MORE DESIGN THAT UH A SQUAREY BOX WITH A RUBBER
YEAH
ACTUALLY
AS SOON AS YOU THOUGHT TO MOVE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU HAVE THE LIGHT
YEAH
AGAIN
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY EXPENSIVE BUT AT THE END THIS IS PLENTY OF UNEXPEN EH VERY CHEAP DEVICES BUT UH THE BILL STARTS TO BE
FIRST OF ALL I WAS THINKING TO HAVE A A CONTINUOUS LIGHT AND YOU W WHEN T YOU YOU YOU YOU PRESS THE ON BUTTON YOU HAVE THE LIGHT ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
WHEN YOU WANT TO TURN OFF YOUR DEVICE
YEAH A LITTLE BIT
A LITTLE BIT
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
TO S
MM-HMM
I SUPPORT AN APPLE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ME TOO
AH IT'S OKAY
I KNOW THAT THEY DO THAT FOR ALARM CLOCK ALSO
YEAH
MM-HMM
WHAT ABOUT UM
AND FOR MAYBE LOOK AND FEEL WHAT ABOUT A A PIECE OF ICE
WITH BLUE L. E. D. INSIDE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
BANANA I THINK IT'S A NICE IDEA
BECAUSE
BUT
YOU Y YOU DON'T USE THE BANANA WHEN THE BANANA IS CURVING LIKE THAT BUT WHEN THE BANANA IS CURVING LIKE THAT
WITH THE WHEEL ON THE TOP AND TO CONTROL AND HERE YOU HAVE A A PUSH BUTTON TO
YEAH
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT IS A BANANA
BASICALLY
IF YOU IF YOU START WITH UH FANCY FRUITS AND FRA S AND THA
OH YEAH
SO
SO WE WILL JUST USE A A STANDARD BATTERY
AND UH THE CHIP WE CHIP IMPRINT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHICH ONE WE ARE GOING TO USE
UH WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CASE
YEAH
UH I MEAN FOR ME IF WE USE A A SPONGY BANANA CASE DOESN'T MATTER
I JUST WANT TO HAVE SO SOMETHING TO PRIN TO TO FIX MY MY COMPONENTS ONTO THAT BOX AND THAT'S IT
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SPONGY ALSO
OH NO I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
YEAH
YEAH
THIS IS UH LIKE THE
MM-HMM
WHEEL ON THE TOP
BUTTON WHERE DO WE WANT SOME BUTTONS
YEAH
YEP
YEP
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
THANK YOU
MM-HMM
ABDUL AL HASRED IS MY NAME
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
ALSO HAVE TO SAY DID YOU RECEIVE THE EMAIL ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION
NO
YEAH
YOU WE UH AN EMAIL FROM THE MANUFACTURING DIVISION THAT THEY HAVE BASICALLY A VOICE RECOGNITION CHIP ALREADY DEVELOPED
SAYS
YEAH
IT SAYS THAT RI RIGHT NOW THEY JUST USE IT TO UH TO RECORD UH ANSWERS TO PARTICULAR QUESTIONS
BUT I GUESS IT COULD BE
I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE
I MEAN INSTEAD OF RECORDING THE ANSWERS YOU CAN JUST UH RECORD UH SOMETHING SIMPLER LIKE A COMMAND
YEAH YOU RECO RECOGNIZE COMMANDS AND YOU CAN RECORD NEW COMMANDS AND STUFF SO IF THEY ALREADY HAVE IT AS UH AS A CHIP
THEN WE WE COULD USE IT
OKAY
MM-HMM
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY
UM WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LIGHT
IS
BUT
BUT IN TH IN THE DARK UH
YEAH BUT IS GOING TO BE ALWAYS TURNED ON THE LIGHT
BUT IF YOU MOVE IT THEN YOU HAVE IT YOU DON'T NEED TO FIND IT
YOU CAN SEE THE BUTTONS BETTER OF COURSE
YEAH
BUT IF YOU MOVE IT THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SENSOR TO WHEN YOU MOVE IT TO DETECT YOUR MOVEMENT
YEAH BUT YOU NEED ANOTHER SENSOR FOR THAT RIGHT
YEAH NO IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
OKAY
MM
EXTRA
YEAH OKAY
MM
YEAH BUT I EXPECTED ALSO THE WHEEL WOULD BE CHEAP BUT YOU TELL ME THAT IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE SO YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
SO UH MY ONE IT UH SHOULD BE IN THE SHARED FOLDER
SO
IT WAS LAST TIME I SAW IT
OKAY
SO JUST MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE
SO BASICALLY WANT VERY SIMPLE RIGHT
THAT'S THE MAJOR IDEA AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE
SO I JUST LOOK AT SOME CURRENT DESIGNS UH ON THE WEB OF USUALLY MORE COMPLICATED REMOTE CONTROLS
AND LET'S LOOK AT TWO OF THEM BECAUSE UH TH EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE MANY BUTTONS THEY LOOK QUITE SIMPLE
AND IN OUR CASE WE JUST UH REJECT THE BUTTONS WHAT WE DON'T NEED AND IT BECOME EVEN SIMPLER
UM
SO
YEAH
WELL THIS THESE UH THESE REMOTES ARE QUITE BIG SO GO TO THE NEXT PAGE SO
WE HAVE ALL THESE BUTTONS AS YOU CAN SEE BUT MOST OF THEM WE JUST NEED THE ONES IN THE MIDDLE
SO FROM THE BOTTOM OR WHATEVER IS THERE UH THE UH THE NUMBERS AND THEN THE TOP
UH UNTIL THE TEN ALSO THIS MIDDLE PART AND ON THE LEFT ONE IS EXACTLY THE SAME
SO IT'S BASICALLY MORE OR LESS HOW WE WOULD LIKE IT WITH A BIG VOLUME CONTROL BIG CHANNEL CONTROL AND MUTE AND POWER YEAH
THESE ARE THE BASIC THING
SO BASICALLY W SOFTWARE WE WILL BUILD WILL LOOK MORE OR LESS THE SAME AS THESE TWO
YEAH IF YOU HAVE
FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THAT THE VOLUME AND THE BUTTONS THAT ARE THERE ON THE TOP ARE NOT VERY EASY TO REACH WITH YOUR THUMB
IT COULD BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THESE INPUT BUTTONS AND THIS OTHER STUFF THAT THEY HAVE
AND I THINK THAT THE PLASTIC COVER IS NOT VERY GOOD UH IDEA BECAUSE
YOU OPEN IT IT CAN BREAK YOU CA YOU CAN DO VARIOUS THINGS
UH YOU JUST NEED TO PUT THE CHANNEL NUMBERS SOMEWHERE A BIT OUT OF THE WAY
SO THAT THEY'RE SEPARATE A BIT YEAH
UH AND IT'S EASY TO PRESS THE OTHER THE BIG BUTTONS BUT UH IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO PRESS THE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS EITHER
MM
YEAH I THINK THAT IF YOU PUT THE COVER IT WILL BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE USER
ALRIGHT YOU WON'T YEAH
USUALLY WHAT I HAVE NOTICED THAT PEOPLE PUT THE PLASTIC COVER ON THINGS THAT YOU NORMALLY DON'T MESS WITH
LIKE BUTTONS FOR T UH TUNING THE CHANNELS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
YEAH
THAT YOU WANT TO PROTECT A BIT
AND I THINK IT'S UH IT'S REASONABLE
SO I DON'T THINK
YEAH THIS IS JUST THE THE WHEEL
WE COULD USE THE SOME WHEELS CAN BE PUSHED DOWN COULD USE THE PUSH DOWN OF THE WHEEL FOR THE RECORD IF WE WANT
UH SO WE COULD JUST BASICALLY USE ONE JUST WHEEL AND UH USER COULD USE JUST THE WHEEL TO DO EVERYTHING WITH THE CHANNELS IN THAT CASE
YEAH I GUESS THE MARKET RESEARCHER WILL TELL US ALL ABOUT THAT
MM-HMM
WELL WOU WOU I THINK WE CAN CERTAINLY JUST PUT THE ELECTRONICS IN A SPONGY THING IT IT WOULD WORK RIGHT
YEAH
YOU CAN THROW IT TO THE TELEVISION
HEY THAT'S A COOL ONE
WE COULD SAY THAT IF YOU THROW IT YOU HAVE A SENSOR AND YOU THROW IT AND HITS THE TELEVISION AND TURNS IT OFF
WHEN IT D UH TAKES A SHOCK
YEAH
HOW DO WE MAKE IT LOOK COOL IS THE QUESTION
YEAH
WELL THE OBVIOUS THING IS A BANANA I GUESS
THE BANANA IS ALSO ERGONOMIC
IS THERE ANY FRUIT THAT IS SPONGY
YEAH
YOU CAN MAKE IT UM
IT'S NOT HARD THE METAL
PLASTIC
MM
YEAH
TWO OF THE BUTTON YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO YOU CAN JUST HAVE UH JUST HAVE THIS CURVE YEAH
AND YOU MOVE UH YOUR HAND HERE TO PRESS THE BUTTONS AND THEN YOU MOVE UH ON THE OTHER SIDE
SO YOU CAN HAVE IT ON ON TWO SIDES AND IT'LL BE COOL NO
YOU CAN PUT ALSO VIBRATOR INSIDE
AH HA
YOU CAN ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THE BANANA FITS WITH THE COLOUR SCHEME OF OUR COMPANY
YEAH
I HOPE THE STUDENTS OF MANAGEMENT DIE BUT ANYWAY
NOW WHO ARE RECORDING THIS MEETING
THE ONLY TH
YEAH
Y YEAH THAT CAN BE IN INSIDE TH IN THE STRUCTURE
BUT UH THE THING IS THAT THE BUTTONS AND THE WHEEL HAVE TO BE I MEAN IF IT'S SPONGY THEN THE BUTTONS AND THE WHEEL HAVE TO I MEAN IF IT'S SPONGY THEN IT'S GOING TO MOVE
RIGHT
SO IT'S GOING TO BE BEND A LOT
SO IF WE TRY TO PUSH THE BUTTONS IT YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
OKAY
YEAH
WELL USUALLY HOLD 'KAY WE WANT IT TO BE GOOD ALSO FOR THE LEFT HAND USERS RIGHT
UH
YEAH BUT OKAY
SA LET'S SAY THAT TH O IT HAS TO BE BASICALLY YOU CAN ONLY TAKE TWO SIDES
ONE ON THS THIS SIDE WHERE IS THE THUMB AND THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THERE IS UH YEAH ALSO THE THUMB
BASICALLY
OR YOU COULD USE USE THIS ONE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO USE THIS ONE FOR THE WHEEL
THIS FOR THE WHEEL AND THEN THIS FOR THE BUTTONS
SHOULD HAVE THE TWO SIDES
SO IF THE LEFT WE HAVE
THE OP
WHEEL WHEEL BUTTONS
YEAH THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU HAVE BUTTONS AND WHEEL THEN WHEN YOU TURN IT AROUND THE BUTTONS ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE
SO YOU CANNOT SEE THEM
YEAH
SO THE BUTTONS HAVE TO BE HERE AND THE WHEEL HAS TO BE
Y
YEAH I KNOW BUT UH IF YOU HOLD WITH YOUR LEFT HAND AND THE WHEEL IS HERE
AND THE BUTTONS ARE HERE THEN WHEN YOU TURN IT AROUND THE BUTTONS WILL BE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OKAY
OKAY
MAYBE
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YES MASTER
NO
YEAH
YEAH
NO
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE UH UH MM OKAY
OKAY I CAN GO
CAN I
SO NOW THE RECENT INVESTIGATION WE WE HAVE DONE FO OF THE REMOTE CONTROL UM
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROLS IS TO BE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL AND NOT CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL
AND UM THE SECOND ASPECT IS UH THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE
AND THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS TO TO IS THAT THE CO REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
SO ARE THINGS WE ARE WE HAVE UH SPEAK ABOUT BEFORE
YEAH
AND UM SO YOU YOU CAN GO
AFTER
AND THERE IS A FASHION WATCHERS IN PARIS AND MILAN THAT HAVE DETECTED THE FOLLOWING TRENDS
UH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURES
SO MAYBE IF OUR REMOTE CONTROL HAVE TO BE A FRUIT FORM OR VEGETABLE FORM SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR
AND THE MM THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY
UH I DON'T KNOW WHICH MATERIAL CAN BE SPONGY AND IF YOU
MM-HMM
OKAY IT'S ROBUST YEAH
NOT GOOD
AN AND AND UH THIS UH YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN SAY THAT
YOU CA UH YOU CAN GO UH BEFORE BEFORE YES
AND YOU KNOW HERE THE MORE IZ IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL AFTER IS UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE AND AFTER THE EASY TO USE
YEAH THAT'S WHY YEAH THAT'S WHY I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IF IT'S POSSIBLE
INNOVATIVE
MM
YEAH
MM
OH COLOUR YEAH
OH I I
I THOUGHT ABOUT A A PEAR FOR EXAMPLE
YOU KNOW THE PEAR IS LIKE THAT AND IT'S IT'S EASY TO TO HAVE IN IN HAND AND UH
YEAH
OR A FRUIT LIKE THAT
I DUNNO
YEAH
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
YEAH
OKAY
JE CROIX QUE C'EST DOMMAGE DE LE IT WILL BE SAD TO DESTROY THIS PROTOTYPE
IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE A BANANA
IT IS A BANANA
MM
OKAY
HI
SO WE ARE HERE FOR THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
SO WE WILL UH I WILL FIRST PRESENT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IN THIS MEETING
THEN
UH I'VE I WILL ALSO TAKE NOTES DURING THIS MEETING AND I WILL SEND YOU UH A SUMMARY THEN AS USUAL
WE WILL THEN LOOK AT THE EVALUATION CRITERIA OF THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTED BY UH OUR TWO COLLEAGUES THAT MAKE GOOD WORK
AND UH THEN WE WILL SEE THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS AND THE COST OF THE PRODUCT
THEN WE WILL UH EVALUATE THE PRODUCT
AND UH END
WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THIS PROJECT AND SEE WHETHER IT FITS
WITH IT FULF IF IT FULFIL THE REQUIREMENT OR NOT
SO D LET'S START WITH THE COST ASPECT SO SO I LOOK AT THE ASPECT DISCUSSED LAST TIME THAT IS TO SAY UH TO HAVE A STANDARD BATTERY
TO HAVE A YELLOW BANANA SHAPED UH CASE WITH UH A RUBBER MATERIAL AROUND IT TO BE UH TO FEEL SPONGY
AND UH ALSO AT THE DIFFERENT ASPECT LIKE HAVING A WHEEL ETCETERA
AND THE COST ENDED TO BE TEN POINT SEVEN EUROS
SO WHICH IS UH GOOD BECAUSE WE HAD A PRICE GAP OF TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS
SO FOR THE FINANCIAL ASPECT IT'S OKAY WE CAN UH WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THIS PRODUCT UH AS IF
AND WE ARE NOW GOING TO SEE THE PROJECT EVALUATION WITH UH OUR MARKETING EXPERT
YEAH
YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION
PARTICIPANT FOUR YES
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MAYBE YOU CAN PRESEN OKAY
MAYBE HOLD IT
SO I THINK IT'S UH VERY UH VERY NICE
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YEAH
SO IT'S BETWEEN ONE AND SEVEN
SEVEN IS THE HIGHEST UH
I WILL GIVE A SIX
MAYBE WE ALL HAVE TO AGREE ON A COMMON
YEAH
NO PROBLEM
SO THIS IS YOUR
ONE IS MOST
WELL WE CAN CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT
OKAY LET'S SAY THAT SEVEN IS THE BEST
OKAY
SO SO DO NOTE THE GRADE WE HAVE FIVE SIX FOR ME FIVE
AND WHAT WHAT'S YOUR CHOICE
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU GIVE ON THE FANCY ASPECT ON THE FASHIONABLE ASPECT
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU YOU DON'T ANSWER TO THIS UH QUESTIONNAIRE
FIVE POINT FIVE AVERAGE
OKAY
WELL DOES IT
OKAY TECHNE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECT
YEAH WE HAVE THE WHEEL
WE ALSO HAVE THE RUBBER MATERIAL
WHICH MAKE IT UH
LIKE
NEW ALSO
I THINK I WOULD GIVE A FIVE
FOUR
OKAY
NO
SO WHAT'S YOUR UH GRADE
FOUR
SO WE HAVE FOUR FOUR F AND FIVE
YEAH FOUR
FOUR YEAH LET'S PUT FOUR
DOESN'T IT
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH
I WOULD GIVE A I WOULD GIVE A SEVEN AS WELL
IT'S VERY EASY TO USE
SO SIX POINT FIVE
OKAY
OH YEAH ITS ITS F ITS FRUIT FRUIT SHAPE
I WOULD SAY SEVEN
AND IS VERY VERY NICE DESIGN
YEAH
SEVEN OKAY
I THINK YOU CAN'T MISS IT
OKAY
YEAH WE HAVE THE WE DON'T SESH ESPECIALLY HAVE THE LIGHTNING BUT
SO IT'S YELLOW
IT'S OKAY
I THINK IT'S VERY EASY TO I WOULD SAY SEVEN
IT'S HARD TO MISS IT
YEAH IT'S RUBBER MADE OF RUBBER I THINK IT'S M IT'S UH MORE RUBBER THAN UH OTHER REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
BUT IT IS UH IT IS SURROUNDED BY RUBBER MATERIAL
SO MAYBE WE CAN PUT A SIX
SIX IS OKAY
YEAH
TADADA
WE HAVE TO SUM UP EVERYTHING
SIX IS A GOOD
YEAH THE BE
OKAY SO SIX IS A
SO IT'S A GOOD EVALUATION I THINK
IT'S VERY PROMISING
HUH
SO THIS PROTOTYPE IS QUITE NICE
YEAH
OKAY
SO HAVING THIS AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS UH QUITE ATTRACTIVE I THINK
I THINK THE
YEAH
SO I THINK WE CAN SUMMARISE
SO WE HAVE SEEN THE PROTOTYPE
IT'S VERY NICE ACCORDING TO THE WORK OF OUR TWO DESIGNER
THE THE THE FINANCIAL ASPECT WERE OKAY
WE WE HAVE THE COST BELOW UH OUR THRESHOLD AND SO WE COULD SELL AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS AND MAKE I MAKE PROFIT
THE THE EVALUATION GIVE SATISFYING RESULT AS WELL
SO I THINK WE CAN MOVE TO THE LAST PART OF THE MEETING
SO THE COST IS IN THE BUDGET THE EVALUATION IS OKAY SO I TH I THINK WE CAN NOW UH OPEN CHAMPAGNE AND MAKE A HUGE PARTY
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PROVIDED BY UH BY THE MEETING STAFF
OKAY SO CONGRATULATION
NICE PRODUCT
YEAH
I THINK IT WAS A GOOD COLLABORATION UH
ASPECT
SORRY
I THINK WE WILL HAVE UM MUCH BIGGER PROJECT NEXT TIME AND A MUCH BIGGER SALARY AS WELL
ALL IT DEPENDS ON WHO WATCH THIS MEETING
WE DON'T KNOW
OKAY SO GOOD GUYS SO SEE YOU FOR NEXT UH SUCCESSFUL PROJECT
HI
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I WILL GIVE A A FIVE

A FOUR ALSO BECAUSE EXCEPT FOR THE WHEEL WE DON'T HAVE SO MUCH INNOVATION
THE RUBBER IS
UH A FOUR
I I
YEAH
SIX
SIX
SIX SIX SIX POINT FIVE
YEAH SEVEN
EASY TO FIND
I LOST MY BANANA
UH
SIX
YEAH OKAY
UH F YEAH IT'S RU IT'S RUBBER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SIX OR FIVE
FIVE
SIX
YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT ALMO ALSO THE COMPLEXITY BETWEEN A PHONE AND A REMOTE CONTROL IS NOT CANNOT COMPARE
START TO EAT BANANA
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
FRUITS
IT IS A BANANA
IT IS THE ESSENCE OF BANANAS
I WOULD BE CONFUSED WITH THIS THING
S
HOW IS EVERYONE
MM-HMM
LIKE A BANANA
I GIVE IT A I GIVE IT A FIVE
AND YOU
DO YOU VOTE UH CHRISTINE
DO YOU ALSO VOTE
WELL WE CAN VERY EASILY
I
SO IT WILL HAVE FIVE POINT FIVE AVERAGE
MM

D ARE WE INCLUDING THE VOICE ARE YOU GLU ARE WE INCLUDING THE VOICE IN THE END OR NOT
HUH
NO
OKAY
YEAH
FOR TWENTY FIVE
YEAH
I GIVE A SEVEN I THINK
'KAY
YEAH WE CAN WE CAN PUT A SEVEN HERE
YEAH
YEAH
WELL WE HOPE
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT'S COOL
I THINK WE CAN PUT A SIX HERE
SO YOU'LL MAKE THE MATERIAL TRANSPARENT SO THAT IT UH LIGHTS UP COMPLETELY OR
YEAH
YEAH THE ONLY PROBLEM THERE MIGHT BE WHICH KNOW I IF IT'S VERY SENSITIVE THEY WILL I DON'T KNOW
YEAH OKAY
MM
SIX YEAH FOR ME
YEAH
TWENTY
THIRTY
THIR
OKAY
YEAH THE TOP
MM
SO WILL BECOME EIGHT SOON
YEAH WELL IT'S A BIT BIASED
OKAY
BECAUSE I SAW UH SOME PHONES THAT WERE BANANA SHAPED UH WIRELESS PHONES NOT MOBILE ONES WIRELESS FOR THE HOUSE
UH QUITE BIG ALSO AND THEY WERE SELLING SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED EUROS TWO HUNDRED EUROS
JUST A JUST A PHONE WIRELESS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLEX BUT
OKAY
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE TEAM
UH VERY WELL WE WORKED TOGETHER FANTASTICALLY
SO WHAT DOES THE MANAGEMENT SAY

WE CAN GO THROUGH
SO I MADE AN EVALUATION AND THE THE EVALUATION CRITERIA IS MADE ACCORDING TO THE USERS' REQUIREMENTS AND THE MARKET TRENDS WE TALKED ABOUT UH DURING THE PREVIOUS UH MEETINGS
SO YOU CAN GO THROUGH AND OKAY SO UH WE HAVE UH SIX POINTS
WE
WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE
SO WE WE WANT TO HAVE A PRODUCT FANCY LOOK AND FEEL TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE EASY TO USE FASHION EASY TO FIND IN A ROOM
AND ROBUST UH AND UH UH I HAVE A SCALE OF UH SEVEN POINTS
OKAY
SO I GO THROUGH ALL THE UH ALL THE POINTS HERE
AND UH ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE THIS PROJECT YOU CAN UH MM MAKE A ONE POINT TWO POINT OR SEVEN POINT
OKAY
AND AFTER WE HA WE HAVE AN AN AVERAGE AND UH WE SEE
THE OKAY
UH SO UH FANCY LOOK AND FEEL WHAT DO YOU THINK
F BETWEEN O ONE AND SEVEN
YEAH
SEVEN IS THE
MM-HMM
SORRY

OH YES I MM I DUNNO MM I THINK SIX IT'S A GOOD UH
YEAH
WA CAN
OKAY
I SORRY
OKAY
SO AFTER THE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECT
SO WE WE SAID UH WE HAVE UH A NEW TECHNOLOGICAL UH THING WITH A WHEEL

EVERYONE IS OKAY OR FOUR POIN
FOUR
OKAY
VERY EASY TO USE
DO YOU THINK IT'S EASY TO USE
MM SIX FOR ME ALSO
SIX POINT FIVE
OKAY
IS IT FASHION
SEVEN
YEAH IT'S FASHION BECAUSE IT'S A FRUIT AND WE SAY THAT THE YEAH SEVEN
UH EASY TO FIND IN A ROOM
YEAH
WE HAVE THE LIGHTNING OR
THE LIGHTING
YEAH
SEVEN
IS IT IS IT ROBUST
EVERYBODY IS OKAY SIX
YEAH
OKAY
S NOW UM SO
THIRTEEN UH TWENTY TWENTY SIX POINT FIVE UH SEVEN THIRTY TWO THIRTY SIX
THAT'S THAT'S OKAY
SIX
GOOD
UH IF WE SAY THAT SEVEN IT'S UH IT'S THE BETTER AND WHEN UH S SIX SIT SIX ARE GOOD IT'S A GOOD UH P PRODUCT I THINK
WE HAVE A GOOD PRICE AND UH
GOOD
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
SO
WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
NOW HOPEFULLY WE'VE ALL GOT A BETTER IDEA FROM THAN WE DID F LEAVING THE LAST MEETING AS TO WHAT IT IS WE ARE UP TO NOW
SO HERE'S AN AGENDA
UH I'LL OPEN
UM YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I'LL BE TAKING MINUTES DURING ALL THE MEETINGS
AS I WAS STRUGGLING TO OUR LAST TIME UH AND THAT'LL BE EASIER FOR ME NOW BECAUSE I'M NOT ACTUALLY GIVING THE WHOLE PRESENTATION
UH THE ADDITIONAL POINTS ARE JUST THE STUFF THAT WE SENT AND THAT I FORWARDED ON FROM UPPER MANAGEMENT HAVING A FEW BRIGHT IDEAS TO MAKE OUR LIVES PAINFUL
UM NOW YOU CAN ALL GIVE YOUR PRESENTATIONS
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS AND HOPEFULLY COME TO SOME DECISIONS
RIGHT FORTY MINUTES FOR THIS MEETING SO A BIT MORE TIME THAN THE LAST ONE
HERE'S THE ADDITIONAL POINTS I JUST WANTED TO PUT THOSE IN THERE TO SEE IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY COMMENTS
ON THEM
UH DID YOU ALL RECEIVE THAT EMAIL
SO DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OVERALL
MM
MM
YEP
MM
WELL THA THAT FIRST POINT COULD UH ALSO BE AN OP OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IN SEEING THAT TELETEXT IS BECOMING OUTDATED
SOME SORT REMOTE CONTROL THAT CAN WORK WITH THE INTERNET THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S PRESENTED I GUESS
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
BUT BUT WE ARE SORT OF BEING DICTATED THAT THIS SHOULD ONLY BE FOR THE TELEVISION
SO WE'RE QUITE FIXED
SO WE'RE REALLY PROBABLY IN TERMS OF MARKETING ARE LOOKING FOR THAT'S UH THAT'S A COST WINNER RATHER THAN A FANTASTIC NEW FEATURE PRODUCT
YEAH
HMM
HMM
BUT THERE'S ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR MARK THERE'S A MARKET HERE FOR OUR LOST TELETEXT
FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE THAT JUST GOES TO THE SHOP THAT WANTS A REPLACEMENT WANTS IT AS CHEAP AS POSSIBLE
TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS THE SELLING PRICE WE REALLY HAVE TO INNOVATE HERE I GUESS
MM
K YEAH
MM 'KAY
OKAY
OKAY I THINK THAT THE LAST POINT IS PROBABLY QUITE UH STRAIGHTFORWARD
OBVIOUSLY THE THE W IT HAS TO BE BRANDED
'KAY
ON THE PRODUCT YEAH
CAN YOU HANDLE THAT BLACK AND YELLOW
MM
NAH
SO WE HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND I THINK WE'LL GO IN
ORDER OF PARTICIPANT NUMBER HERE
SO WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE WORKING DESIGN FIRST FROM PARTICIPANT TWO
THAT'S
OKAY
MM IT'S ENOUGH
BUT UH CLICK IT ON OFF
DO WE HAVE AN IDEA OF COSTS OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS
'KAY
MM 'KAY
DO WE HAVE ANY BALLPARK FIGURES FOR THAT YET
NO
'KAY
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
THANKS
AND WE HAVE PARTICIPANT THREE WHICH I BELIEVE IS PEDRO
I CAN GIVE YOU THAT TO CLICK ON
AND YOU WANNA GET
VIEW A SLIDE SHOW THAT'S WHAT YOU WANNA DO YEAH
JUST GO UP TO VIEW
MM 'KAY
BUT I T I THINK WHAT THE THE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATION WAS LESS THAT THERE'S A WORRY THAT TELETEXT WILL BECOME OUTDATED RATHER THAN WE SHOULDN'T HAVE IT
SO I I STILL THINK IF IT'S CHEAP ENOUGH FUNCTIONALITY WISE TO INCLUDE IT REALLY SHOULD BE IN THERE
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST GOING TO I MEAN EVEN IF IT'S NECESSARY OR NOT
IF YOU IF YOU'RE GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN A T A REMOTE WITH TELETEXT OR WITHOUT UH WHEN IT REALLY IF IT I IF IT ISN'T MORE EXPENSIVE FOR US TO K MAKE BECAUSE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT
IT CAN BE OPERATED WITH THE SAME SET OF BUTTONS YEAH
SO IT SHOULD BE IN THERE
YEAH
OKAY
ISN'T
WELL MAYBE WHAT WE'RE GETTING INTO HERE IS THE THE IDEA OF UH INTERNET THROUGH THE T. V. FOR EXAMPLE
SO THAT MIGHT PLAY ON WHAT WE CAN DO
WELL YOU HAVE DIGITAL T. V. STILL ALREADY
WELL THERE THERE IS A FOR EXAMPLE ON DIGITAL T. V. SYSTEMS YOU HAVE YOU CAN PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU CAN BUY THINGS IN ADVERTS
AND YOU CAN UH YOU CAN VIEW THROUGH A CATALOGUE FOR EXAMPLE
A A FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE HAS GOT A SYSTEM WHERE YOU JUST UM YOU CAN
YEAH AND THERE'S OTHER FEATURES FOR EXAMPLE ON OTHER SYSTEMS WHERE YOU CAN PAUSE LIVE T. V. AND THINGS LIKE THAT
THEY'RE JUST FEATURES FROM THE INTERNET UH FROM COMPUTERS ARE ARE COMING INTO THE T. V. SORT OF UNDER THE COVERS BUT YOU STILL USE IT THROUGH A TELETEXT
SO NOW THE THINGS TO THINK HERE ARE THAT THAT THERE'S GONNA BE MORE FUNCTIONALITY POTENTIALLY THAT WE CAN HANDLE
MM
BUT STILL THERE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY
IF IF IT'S FOR EXAMPLE A TRAINABLE ONE THEN WE'RE JUST SIMPLY HAVING LIKE AN UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT
AN OKAY BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MIGHT MIGHT DO AS WELL IN FUTURE PROOFING IT
MM
OKAY
YEAH AND NEITHER DO I IN FACT
BU UH
I'LL COMMUNICATE THAT BACK TO THOSE GUYS THERE A A AND TH THE MESSAGE REALLY WE WANNA BE SENDING TO THEM IS THAT
ALTHOUGH TELETEXT MAY BECOME OUTDATED W THERE'S NO L LOGIC IN NOT HAVING IT IN THERE ANYWAY
I IF IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE PRICE
UM BUT I I THINK WHAT THEY'RE PUSHING US TOWARDS HERE IS IN TERMS OF THINKING OF WAYS TO FUTURE PROOF OUR SYSTEM FOR FUTURE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN TELETEXT MAYBE
I DUNNO I'M
MM 'KAY
MM
YEAH
HMM
SO IF WE'RE KEEPING IT BASIC WE'RE LOO LOO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO SELL IT BASICALLY IS IT'S UH JUST BEING VERY EASY TO USE
LOOKING EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD THAT SORT OF THING
'CAUSE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THERE DO WE
MM-HMM
BUT I IF DESIGN IF DESIGN IS CHEAP AND FUNCTIONALITY IS BASIC
THEN TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS PROBABLY A HIGH PRICE FOR A COMMONER GARDEN STAN STANDARD T. V. SO THE PLACE UH REMOTE THE THEN THE PLACE WE'RE GOING TO JUSTIFY THAT COST IS THROUGH THROUGH DESIGN THROUGH MAKING IT A A SLEEK ELEGANT HIGH PRICED BASIC REMOTE
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE HUH
MM
YEAH WE PROBABLY SHOULD
WE WE'RE DOING ALRIGHT FOR TIME
YEAH
OKAY
SORRY THAT KINDA CUT INTO YOU THERE
MM
SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD AND JUST WORKS RATHER THAN LOOKING FOR ANY SPECIAL FEATURES
IS THAT
MM
BUT WE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE POTENTIALLY IN THE MARKETING MARKETING PRESENTATION ABOUT THIS
BE A GOOD IDEA
UH SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT IN
I'M NOT THE BOSS
OKAY
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A QUESTION MORE FOR
FOR THIS GUY HERE YEAH
IS IT
OKAY
MM
HMM
OKAY
I HAVE A QUESTION UH FOR YOU
DOES ANY OF THE UM THE FEATURES THAT PEDRO'S SPOKEN ABOUT HERE HAVE ANY IMPLICATIONS WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ON IN TERMS OF JUST PURE FUNCTIONALITY
IN TERMS OF MAKING IT WORK OR THE COST OF THAT OR
OKAY
'KAY
CHEERS
ONTO PARTICIPANT FOUR
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
NOW THE THE QUESTION IS CAN WE MAKE THIS FOR LESS THAN TWELVE FIFTY PER
WE WE WELL DO WE NECESSARILY HAVE TO CHANGE THE END COST BECAUSE UH
CAN WE DL CAN WE DO THAT WITHOUT UH CHANGING IT TWELVE FIFTY PER PRODUCT IF WE BASICALLY CAN SELL MORE BASED ON THIS
MM-HMM
YEAH WE WE CAN CERTAINLY PUSH FOR A MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCT IF THAT'S GONNA BE
NAH I THINK WE CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY NOW THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING TELETEXT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
AND AND TH TO GET TO BACK TO ANOTHER POINT SORRY UH UH FOR CUTTING IN BUT
I TH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THAT THIS REMOTE HAS TO WORK WITH MULTIPLE T. V. S YEAH 'CAUSE IT'S SELLING ON ITS OWN
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SPECIFICALLY FOR HITACHI T. V. S OR OR WHATEVER
SO TECHNOLOGICALLY IF I UNDERSTAND IT UH T. V. S T. V. REMOTE'S WORKING EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS VIDEO REMOTES AND D. V. D. REMOTES
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TRAIN THEM TO THE INDIVIDUAL ONE ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS IS KNOW THE THE F LIKE SOME FOUR DIGIT CODE
SO SAYING THAT IT WORKS WITH ALL T. V. S IS EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT IT'LL WORK WITH D. V. D. S AND OTHER THINGS
OH OKAY OKAY
WE HAVE DONE THIS
I SEE
MM-HMM
AND I I'D MM SORRY
SO WE REALLY CAN'T CHASE THAT
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING BASIC
THE THE ONE THING THAT THAT THAT YOU SAID REALLY STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME HERE IN THAT WE'RE WE'RE CARRYING THE CORPORATE IDENTITY WITH THE PRODUCT
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A LARGE PROFIT AT THE SAME TIME WHERE I'D BE INCLINED TO GO BACK TO UPPER LEVEL MANAGEMENT AND SAY LIKE LET'S JUST CUT DOWN OUR PROFIT EXPECTED ON THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE WE ARE ACTUALLY BRANDING OUR COMPANY HERE
WE'RE SELLING MORE THAN JUST THE PRODUCT
WE'RE TRYING TO GET MIND SHARE ABOUT UH REAL REACTION TO TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA BUY CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
WE WANT PEOPLE TO EVENTUALLY SAY OH THAT'S THAT'S REAL REACTION THAT'S A GOOD M MAKE
IT'S RELIABLE
AND AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT WE'RE GONNA WIN MIND SHARE BY UH EITHER BEING A FANTASTIC PRODUCT OR FOR IT WORKING
IT JUST BEING GOOD REASONABLE PRICED AND SOLID
SO IF WE CAN MAKE IF WE CAN PUT AN EMPHASIS HERE ON IT NOT BREAKING I THINK THAT'S IN ITSELF AN EXTREMELY BIG THING
WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES LEFT
IS TWENTY FIVE EUROS A MID MARKET PRICE FOR A REMOTE
OKAY
OKAY
WELL I'D BE INCLINED TO SAY IF WE CAN MAKE THE DESIGN BETTER THAN ANY COMPARABLE REMOTE WHILE REDUCING THE COST
THEN THAT'S THE WAY WE REALLY SHOULD PLAY IT
IF WE CAN TAKE IT DOWN TO YOU KNOW FIFTEEN RATHER THAN TWENTY FIVE AND MAKE A LOW PROFIT MARGIN ON IT BUT WE'RE REALLY DOING THAT TO SELL THE BRAND
YEP WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT
UH RATHER TH UH TO TO TO SELL FOR REAL REACTIONS
AND I CAN COMMUNICATE THIS TO TO THE MORE SENIOR UH MM PEOPLE WITHIN THE COMPANY HERE TO TO GET A REACTION
WELL HOW DOES EVERYBODY FEEL
I I THINK
THE OTHER THE O THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IN MY MIND I JUST THINK OFF HAND AS A AS A CONSUMER WOULD I WANNA BUY THAT
AND I THINK MAYBE NOT BECAUSE I'VE GOT A REMOTE AND I'LL TAKE IT TO DIFFERENT CHAIRS
I'LL TAKE IT TO DIFFERENT I W I DON'T WANNA GO OVER SOMEWHERE AND PUT IT DOWN
IT I IF IT IS GONNA BE SOMEWHERE THAT YOU PUT IT DOWN THEN IT NEEDS TO BE AT THE SIDE OF YOUR ARMCHAIR
AND THAT IMPLIES THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE T. V. USER
SO IT'S VERY GOOD FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT IT'S NOT A LIKE
BUT IT IT TAKES AWAY THE EASE OF USE OF THE REMOTE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
YOU HAVE TO L SORT OF REMEMBER
YOU HAVE TO D SHIFT DOWN THE SIDE OF THE COUCH TO FIND IT AND PUT IT BACK AND
YEAH
I D I D I D I THINK IT IT IN MY MIND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT OH I'D REALLY WANT UH BECAUSE OF THAT FACT
BUT I I DON'T KNOW THAT'S JUST MY OPINION
MM
'KAY
SO WHAT DO WE THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD PEDRO DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION ON IT
REALLY NEED TO WRAP UP NOW
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I MEAN THERE'S AL THERE'S ALSO REMOTE CONTROLS I REMEMBER THAT THAT WORKED UH
THIS HASN'T BEEN DONE IN A WHILE I THINK BUT TH AS A AS A WATCH
YEAH THERE IS REMOTE CONTROL WATCHES UM BUT I THINK THEY'RE A SORTA EIGHTIES THING
SO IT MIGHT NOT BE EASY TO MARKET IN IT UH BUT THE THE TECHNOLOGIES CAME ALONG AND IT MIGHT BE CHEAPER TO MAKE NOW
THOSE THINGS MAY HAVE BEEN INEXPENSIVE FOR ALL I KNOW
GOTTA CUT UP
MM
THE LAST REMOTE YOU'LL EVER BUY
WELL IF IF WE'RE GOING DOWN THAT THEN WE CAN WE DON'T NEED TO GO THE IT IT STRIKES ME THAT THE LOCATOR FEATURE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE UH QUITE EXPENSIVE TO MAKE
WHEREAS ACTUALLY JUST PUTTING IT IN A POWER CRADLE MIGHT NOT BE TOO EXPENSIVE AT ALL BECAUSE THAT'S JUST DONE WITH MOBILE PHONES YOU CAN JUST N WE WE HAVE SAID WE HAVE ACTUALLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN TAKE FROM AND POTENTIALLY CUT COSTS THERE
UM NEED TO LOOK INTO WHETHER WE CAN DO THAT BUT UH I THINK WE WE HAVE SOME M MOBILE PHONE BASED PRODUCTS UH CHECKING QUICKLY OUR INTERNET
WE REALLY NEED TO FINISH UP HERE
BUT UH
YEAH WE HAVE THE THE POWER ADAPTOR PRODUCTS
WE SELL POWER ADAPTOR PRODUCTS
SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING US
USING THAT TECHNOLOGY
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO WITHOUT IT BEING TOO IN FACT WE CAN CUT COSTS THROUGH USING THE MANUFACTURING THAT'S ALREADY GONNA BE IN PLACE HERE
OKAY
YEP
'KAY
THANKS GUYS
YEP
RIGHT
I THINK ONE OF
I THINK W YEAH
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND UM WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS I MEAN OUR COMPANY'S SLOGAN IS WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS RIGHT
SO I THINK OUR KIND OF OUR TARGET HERE IS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF VERY LIKE SLEEK NICE LOOK REMOTE AND WE WANT IT TO BE FUNCTIONAL AS WELL
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN SELLING POINTS IS THAT
WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE CLUNKY LIKE LIKE THIS THING HERE
YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANNA A BIG CLUNKER
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS NICE AND IT'S FASHIONABLE AND SO
THAT'S FINE
OKAY SO
SO YOU ALL KNOW ME I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
AND WE'VE SOME BASIC COMPONENTS THAT UM OUR REMOTE IS GONNA NEED JUST BASICALLY EVERY REMOTE'LL NEED 'EM
WE NEED SOME KINDA OF POWER D POWER SOURCE
UM WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON OUR OUR USER INTERFACE WHICH IS HIS DEPARTMENT BUT THE IN USER INTERFACE IS ALSO A MAJOR COMPONENT
UM WE NEED A PROGRAMMABLE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSOR TO UM TO TAKE THE INPUT FROM THE USER AND TRANSLATE THAT INTO UH
INTO ELECTRONIC SIGNAL WHICH WE PASS TO THE INFRA RED L. E. D. WHICH YOU AIM AT THE TELEVISION UH WHICH AND IT RECEIVES THAT SIGNAL
YOU NEED A ON OFF SWITCH UM I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GOT IN THERE
AND UH WE ALSO NEED TO UM HAVE THE IF WE WANT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE WE NEED TO HAVE ENCRYPTION CODES FOR THE DIFFERENT MAKES OF T. V. S
SO WE NEED TO KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT SIGNALS AND SO THAT'LL REQUIRE SOME MEMORY AS WELL
UM SO HERE'S JUST A BASIC LAYOUT OF HOW HOW THE REMOTE WOULD WORK
YOU HA THE V THE POWER SOURCE IS IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER THERE
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT UH WE HAVE THE USER INTERFACE HERE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE CHIP WHICH DOES ALL OUR SIGNAL PROCESSING
AND THEN PASSES THAT SIGNAL ON TO THE INFRA RED L. E. D. AND THAT SIGNAL IS THEN EMITTED AND RECEIVED BY THE TELEVISION AT THE PHOTO TRANSISTOR
SO THOSE ARE THE BASIC COMPONENTS THAT NEED TO GO INTO THIS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS PRETTY MUCH UH OPEN TO MOVE AROUND
I THINK ANY DES
NO
RIGHT I THINK
YEAH THIS IS JUST THIS IS JUST A BASIC LAYOUT OF EV OF ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT W W ARE GONNA BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY F TO HAVE A WORKING REMOTE
WE CAN ADD THINGS IN LIKE IF WE WANTED SOME VOICE RECOGNITION
I MEAN THAT I MEAN THAT YOU CAN KINDA SAY WOULD WOULD FALL UNDER THE USER INTERFACE AND THE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CHIP
BUT
UM WELL THE MOST THE MOST COSTLY COMPONENTS ARE GONNA BE THE CHIP AND THE UH TH IT COULD ALS BASICALLY THE USER INTERFACE AND THE CASING ARE GONNA BE EXPENSIVE AS WELL
UM THE L. E. D. AND THE THE TRANSISTORS AND EVERYTHING ELSE ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY CHEAP
SO DEPENDING ON WHAT WE WANT OUR FUNCTIONALITY TO BE UM THE CHIP COULD BE EXPENSIVE OR IT COULD BE CHEAP
UM DEPENDING ON THE N AMOUNT OF MEMORY WE NEED IN THERE AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND H AND H YOU KNOW HOW MUCH POWER
UH I DON'T HAVE ANY FIGURES RIGHT NOW
WE UH WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL WE GET TO A MORE SPECIFIC DESIGN PHASE FOR THAT
UM BUT AND I THINK A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE COST COULD BE THE ACTUAL THE ACTUAL CASING ITSELF AND AND YOU KNOW THE THE B THE BUTTONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
I THINK
YEAH
BASICALLY YEAH
SO YEAH
THAT'S ALL I HAVE REALLY
CLICK DON'T YEAH
MM-HMM
RIGHT AS FAR AS I IT'S JUST UH THE COST OF AN EXTRA BUTTON
I MEAN SOFTWARE WISE THERE'S REALLY NO DIFFERENCE
I THINK
SCHEDULING
UM TO FIND OUT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING EVEN IF THERE'S COMMERCIALS YOU KNOW
I THINK I HA
I AGREE
WELL FOR ME
YEAH
UNLESS YOU HAVE A
YEAH
MM-HMM
I THINK A LOT OF THAT'S PROPRIETARY ANYWAYS
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO YOU LIKE COMMAND A TIVO WITH OUR REMOTE
I DON'T THINK
I THINK IF IT'S POSSIBLE YOU SHOULD TRY TO YOU KNOW HAVE A TALK WITH MANAGEMENT ABOUT THAT
JUST YOU KNOW
RIGHT IT'S JUST NOT YEAH
WELL
RIGHT
I'M JUST THINKING YOU KNOW WITH ALL THESE UNIVERSAL REMOTES THAT ARE OUT THERE
HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE EVERY FEATURE THAT AR YOU KNOW I LIKE THESE TRAINABLE REMOTES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST SO CONFUSING TO DO TO USE ALL THESE FUNCTIONS
WHERE
I THINK THE LARGEST PORTION OF THE MARKET IS JUST GONNA YOU KNOW THEY LOST THEIR T. V. REMOTE THEY NEED ANOTHER ONE THAT'LL WORK WITH THEIR T. V.
THEY WANT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS NICE THAT THAT THAT ISN'T GONNA BREAK WHEN THEY DROP IT
THAT YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE IT'S IT'S ERGONOMIC IT FEELS GOOD IN YOUR HAND SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE WHERE YOU'RE GONNA FIND THE BIGGEST YOU KNOW MARKET SHARE
I THINK THE MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES WE ADD IT'S JUST GONNA CUT INTO OUR INTO OUR PROFITS
BECAUSE I THINK AS WE AS WE ADD COSTS FOR THINGS LIKE UH FOR LIKE IF WE ADD THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND THINGS LIKE THAT
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE OF THE UM OF THE MARKET IS ACTUALLY GONNA USE THAT
MAYBE FIVE PERCENT YOU KNOW AND HOW MUCH
RIGHT
YEAH OKAY
I'M SORRY
SORRY BOSS
YEAH
WELL IT'S KINDA BOTH OF US
US US USER INTERFACE
MM-HMM
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT
THEN YOUR LIGHTS WOULD GO OFF THOUGH
YEAH
RIGHT
I DON'T
I THINK ALL THESE THINGS ARE PRETTY STANDARD
I THINK WE'LL BE OKAY
MM YOU CAN JUST CLICK
NO NO NO YOU JUST GET OFF THAT
YOU JUST CLICK ANYWHERE
I HAVE AN IDEA
AND IT'S KIND OF ALONG THE S LINES OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AND IT MAY EVEN FIT INTO ERGONOMICS
AND EVEN KIND OF ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LOSING LOSING THE REMOTE WHAT WE WERE SAYING IT'S A COMMON ISSUE
UM WHAT WE CAN DO IS WELL YOU KNOW THAT BATTERIES THROWING A AW REMOTES RUN THROUGH BATTERIES LIKE CRAZY
RIGHT
AND S FOR SOME PEOPLE YEAH
WELL MAYBE NOT A SOLAR REMOTE BUT INSTEAD WHAT ABOUT IF WE HAD LIKE A POWER CRADLE
LIKE A A CRADLE THAT IS IS THERE TO HOLD THE REMOTE WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING IT
SO YOU'LL ALWAYS KNOW WHERE THE REMOTE IS 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUT IT BACK THERE TO CHARGE THE REMOTE
AND WE CAN INSTEAD OF HAVING INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU KNOW
REPLACEABLE BATTERIES WE'LL JUST HAVE A POWER CELL THAT STAYS THERE FOR THE LIFE OF THE REMOTE
YOU NEVER HAVE TO GET GO THROUGH THE GO THROUGH UH ALL THESE DIFFERENT BATTERIES
AND ALSO YOU CAN I I THINK IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE USER DESIGN OR FOR NOT JUST FOR THE USER DESIGN
BUT ALSO FOR THE JUST FOR THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE REMOTE AS AS A WHOLE
YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE SOME KIND OF NEAT LITTLE YOU KNOW A SEXY DESIGN FOR D A CRADLE AND THE REMOTE ITSELF
IT W IT WOULD INCREASE THE COST
AND YOU COULD PAGE THE REMOTE IF YOU LOSE IT
MAYBE THERE'S A BUTTON ON THE CRADLE
WELL
WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN D LOOK INTO HO WELL PEDRO AND I CAN LOOK INTO HOW MUCH THIS MIGHT INCREASE OUR OUR COSTS AND YOU CAN LOOK INTO WHAT KIND OF EFFECT AN INCREASED COST IS GONNA HAVE ON OUR ON OUR FINAL NUMBERS
I I
YEAH
I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
BECAUSE IN ORDER TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO PRICE IT AT THAT KIND OF LEVEL I THINK WE'D NEED TO HAVE EVERY FUNCTIONALITY THAT ALL THE OTHER COMPETITORS ARE OFFERING LIKE BEING ABLE TO OPERATE
YOU KNOW THE D. V. D. PLAYER AND YOU KNOW THE STEREO SYSTEM AND ALL THAT
WHICH IS A PRETTY BASIC FUNCTION THAT W WE'VE OPTED OUT OF
AND ADDITIONALLY WE'RE M MAYBE NOT SUPPORTING TELETEXT UM
BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME BASIC FEATURES THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT A LOT OF OTHER REMOTES ARE GOING TO HAVE
MM-HMM
I DON I I D I HAVE TO DISAGREE THOUGH
I THINK OUR MARKET NICHE IS BASICALLY PEOPLE WHO NEED WHO HAVE LOST THEIR REMOTE OR UH WHO'VE BROKEN THEIR REMOTE AND DON'T WANNA SEND BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER
THEY JUST WANNA RUN OUT TO THE STORE AND GET A REMOTE
AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA LOOK ON THE SHELF AND THEY'RE GONNA SEE OURS IS THE NICEST LOOKING REMOTE
IT DOES WHAT THEY NEED
THESE AREN'T I I THINK THAT IT
RIGHT
RIGHT
MM-HMM
RIGHT
WELL HERE'S
RIGHT
WE HE WELL HERE'S MY THING ABOUT THAT
IF YOU'RE IN THE MARKET FOR THIS ULTIMATE REMOTE YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO FOR JUST A TELEVISION REMOTE
IF IT CAN'T CONTROL IF IT CAN'T CONTROL YOUR YOUR D. V. D. PLAYER AND A AL IF Y IF YOU CAN'T GET THAT ALL IN ONE ULTIMATE REMOTE
THAT JUST YOU CAN THROW ALL YOUR OTHER REMOTES AWAY
I'M NOT GONNA BUY A D SEVENTY FIVE EURO REMOTE
SO I THINK WHAT WE SO THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING
MM-HMM
I THINK THAT'S BIG
I THINK SO YEAH
YEAH
WHAT ABOUT UM THE IDEA THAT I HAD WITH THE CRADLE
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT
OR HOW DOES EVERYBODY FEEL
NO BUT I THAT'S THE THING I I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY THE OTHER END
MM-HMM
RIGHT
WELL IT LASTS IT WOULD LAST FOR SEVERAL HOURS ON ITS OWN POWER BUT WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH IT YOU PUT IT BACK IN THE CRADLE
YEAH WELL IT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WELL THE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS WE MAY END UP WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF INVENTORY OF A OF A POOR DESIGN YOU KNOW
SO
UM BUT WHAT WE COULD DO IS SOME KIND OF WELL I MEAN
YEAH WE WE NEED TO I MEAN
HAVE A FEW DESIGNS TO LOOK AT AND THEN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE IS YOU KNOW THE BEST FIT
I THINK W WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS IT HAS TO LOOK GOOD IT HAS TO FEEL IT HAS TO FEEL GOOD IN YOUR HAND
IT HAS TO BE DURABLE IT HAS TO A AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK CHEAP
I THINK I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE LOOK AT IT AN AND FEEL LIKE IT ITS LIKE A QUALITY REMOTE
EVEN THOUGH THE COST MAY BE LOW
MM-HMM
OR WHAT IF IT LOOKS LIKE A PEN
YEAH
A POINTER
YEAH
YEAH
SO
JUST TO TOUCH ON M MY POINT ONE LAST TIME THAT I HAD BROUGHT UP
UM I REALLY UN UNLESS YOU GUYS ARE DIE HARD AGAINST THE FACT THAT UM IT'S POSSIBLE LIKE IT REDUCES THE USABILITY OF THE REMOTE B AND THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T LOSE IT ON YOUR OWN
I THINK IT STILL MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO INVESTIGATE HAVING LIKE A POWER CRADLE
BECAUSE I REALLY THINK I IN A CERTAIN SENSE IT ALMOST LIKE FOR ME I WOULD WANT TO HAVE THAT JUST
BECAUSE I KNOW AT THE END OF WHEN I'M DONE WATCHING T. V. THAT WHEN I'M DONE
OH I BETTER GO FIND THE REMOTE AND PUT IT BACK WHERE IT BELONGS
MAYBE TH TH TH THAT'S JUST SOME PEOPLE THAT LIKE THAT
A LOT OF PEOPLE
AS A WATCH
MM 'KAY
MM-HMM
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING
EXACTLY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND ALSO PRESUMABLY THEY'VE
EXACTLY
YEAH
TRUE
RIGHT
YEAH
THE LOCATOR'LL DEFINITELY BE MORE EXPENSIVE
MM-HMM
RIGHT
RIGHT
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN PUT RIGHT ON THE BOX IS NEVER BUY ANOTHER BATTERY
YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH BU BUT WE WE'RE DESIGNING ONLY THE REMOTE WE NOT DESIGN THE T. V.
SO UH WE'RE GONNA BE REMOVING THE TELETEXT OUT OF ANY T. V.
THAT WE PEOPLE USE OUR REMOTE WITH
SO IT'S KIND OF A STUPID DECISION
SO THEN THE DOUBLE R. WILL BE OUR OUR
I THO I THO I THOU
I THINK ROL RO ROLLS ROYCE MIGHT MIND BUT DON'T WORRY
YES
I
HEY MOUSE
OPEN
WHEN WE'RE FIGHTING OVER IT'S ALSO MORE LOT MORE FUN
UH
THIS DOESN'T WORK
SO YEAH FUNCTION DESIGN
UM YOU GUYS KNOW ME PEDRO AND UM
WHAT I FOUND IS WE WANT TO DO FASHION AND I THINK HONESTLY WE SHOULD KEEP TECHNOLOGY LOW AND JUST SIMPLE BASICALLY AND TRY TO AIM FOR DESIGN
IF BASICALLY A CASE WILL WILL COST THE SAME IF IT LOOKS GOOD OR BAD
SO WE MA WE HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
UM SOMETHING CUTE AND SMALL
THE BIG CHUNKY REMOTES ARE DIED IN THE EIGHTIES
SO WE SHOULD JUST GO FOR SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WILL LIKE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT
AND UM ALTHOUGH MO MOST PEOPLE WILL BUY S
TELEVISIONS AND EVERYTHING FOR UH THAT HAVE LOADS OF LOADS OF LITTLE FUNCTIONS AND EVERYTHING AND THEY MOSTLY END UP USING SIMPLE FUNCTIONS AND LITTLE THINGS AND MOST THE PEOPLE WON'T WON'T GET TOO MAD OF ACTUALLY HAVING TO GO THE TO THE S TO THE TELEVISION TO
FOR INSTANCE TUNE IN THEIR THE STATIONS
THERE'S NO NEED TO HAVE THAT IN THE REMOTE
SO UM
UM AS FOR WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR UH THE THE INTERFACE DESIGN AND UH I WILL CHANGE THE COLOURS ON THE ON THE LOGO
BUT UM WE SHOULD GO FOR THE USER ORIENTED DEVICE SO SIMPLE CONTROLS AND GOOD ERGONOMICS
UM AND UH ALTHOUGH I TH I TH I'M STILL HERE RECOMMENDING THE TELETEXT SO I'LL REMOVE THAT I GUESS BUT UM WE SHOULD GO FOR THE
YEAH
YEAH THE THEY'RE BASICALLY AIMING AT SAYING THAT YOU WOULD USE YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TELETEXT TO BE THE EASIEST WAY TO CHECK LIKE FOR UH UH THE SCHEDULING AND THE NEXT PROGRAMME AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND NOW
YEAH AND NOW YOU CAN C LOOK IT OVER INTERNET
BUT I STILL THINK TELETEXT IS WAY MORE CONVENIENT UNTIL UNTIL WE HAVE THE SAME COMMODITIES
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT HAPPEN YET
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE WE DON'T WE'RE NOT AIMING A COMMAND FOR THAT
THAT'S THE THING
AND ALL OF THOSE REQUIRE THE OTHER COMMANDS WITH MORE COMPLEXITY AND MORE SOFTWARE AND
YEAH BUT WE WOULD INCREASE THE PRICE TO TRY TO MAKE IT A TRAINABLE ONE SO
WELL I DUNNO
ONE WAY THE OTHER TELETEXT WAS THERE BUT I GUESS WE CAN REMOVE IT OR YOU KNOW MAKE TWO SEPARATE INTERFACE DESIGNS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE'RE NOT PUTTING SOME THERE'S NO NO PUTTING ANYTHING IN IN THE PLACE OF TELETEXT
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
YEAH
NO JUST I I WOULD I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR CONTINUING TELETEXT AND THOSE WOULD BE THE BASIC COMMANDS
UM AS FOR YOU KNOW THE THE CASE DESIGN UH MAYBE I'LL COME UP WITH MORE CONCRETE IDEAS
RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST THE IDEA OF SIMPLICITY AND SLICKNESS CUTE AND SMALL UM
YEAH
YEAH MM
MM-HMM
BUT WE TH THAT SHOULD BE DESIGN
THAT SHOULD BE THE DESIGN BASICALLY
I THINK TECHNOLOGY WE'D WE WE'RE NOT IN THE PRICE RANGE TO DO IT
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT TOWARDS T F TECHNOLOGY SO WE SHOULD WE SHOULD AIM AT DESIGN
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH Y Y YOU YOU WOULDN'T
THE INTERFACE WILL BE DIFFERENT
GOOD DESIGN
UH WE SHOULD KEEP IT SIMPLE MM MEDIUM LOW COST MAR UM COST AREA AND UH MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
YEAH COMPLICATED BUT
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH THEY ARE NOT SIMPLE
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
WELL UH WHAT COMES UP FOR ME IS THAT IF WE'RE GONNA IF WE'RE GONNA BE MARKETING A PRODUCT THAT IS GOING TO BE UH HAVING NO TELETEXT
PEOPLE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING TELETEXT AND USING TELETEXT
AND SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE GONNA BE A NEW PRODUCT WITHOUT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE HAVING RIGHT NOW
SO THAT'S FROM A MARKETING PERSPECTIVE I I SEE I SEE A LACK
AND SO WE HAVE TO GO I THINK IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
WHAT ARE WE GONNA HAVE THAT MAKES THIS THING BETTER THAN
RIGHT
YEAH
NO I I AGREE WITH YOU
SO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS I SEE THAT ONE SIDE WE'RE ELIMINATING SOMETHING SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER SIDE WHICH IS
WHAT ARE WE GONNA BE TARGETING OUR MARKET UH THAT IDENTIFIES OUR PRODUCT AS BETTER THAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TELETEXT IT HAS TA TA TA TA TA
SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT WAS MY REACTIONS
YEAH YEAH
YEP
OKAY
YEAH
'KAY
THAT'S RIGHT
I THINK WE TAKE WITH YOU
THAT'S WHAT I'M THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS GONNA BE VERY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT 'CAUSE SOMEBODY
SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE HAP UNHAPPY 'CAUSE IT TOOK THEY CAN'T AC ACCESS THEIR TELETEXT
OKAY
'CAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OR NINETY PERCENT OR NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TELEVISIONS OUT THERE ARE ARE TELETEXT
SO SO IT'S IT'S NOT THAT I'M CRITICIZING THE PRODUCT AT ALL
IT'S JUST WHEN WE ELIMINATE THAT THEN WHAT DO WE BRING
WHAT ARE WE BRINGING IN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THIS AND WE HAVE TO D IN MY OPINION WE HAVE TO DOUBLE UP
IF WE LOSE ONE WE NEED TO BRING TWO OR THREE
SO YOU HAVE THIS
NOW IS WOULD THIS BE CONSIDERED JUST A STANDARD UH UM
THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY WE'RE TALKING HERE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXISTING TECHNOLOGY
NOTHING IS BEING MODIFIED OR UPGRADED OR NEW DISCOVERIES
OKAY
OKAY
N OKAY
MM
MM THE SHELL
OKAY
I HAVE MAYBE A SILLY QUESTION
I IN THE VERY BEGINNING IT SAID WITH THE WITH THE ADVENT OF COMPUTERS THERE'S GONNA BE THE IT'S GONNA BE OUT MODED TELETEXT
I I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE TWO THINGS ARE CONNECTED
HOW DOES HOW DOES COMPUTERS AND TELETEXT H HOW WHY IS ONE ELIMINATING THE NEED OF THE OTHER
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
OKAY
YEAH 'CAUSE YEAH I JUST I DON'T SEE THE CROSS OVER BETWEEN COMPUTERS AND TELEVISION
I MEAN I DO SEE THE CROSS OVER IN SOME SENSE BUT BUT BUT BUT WITH THE THE REMOTE IS IS USED FOR TELEVISION OKAY
SO SO IF WE MAKE THE CROSS OVER AND WE'RE GONNA VIEW TELEVISION ON COMPUTERS THEN WE'RE THEN WE'RE LOSING THE THE NECESSITY OF THE REMOTE
S
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE LOGIC
I I DON'T SEE THE LOGIC IN ELIMINATION OF TELETEXT I JUST I I BUT I'M NOT A TECH MIND EITHER
I JUST DON'T SEE THE CROSS OVER BETWEEN COMPUTERS AND AND AND 'CAUSE WE ARE DESIGNING SOMETHING FOR A TELEVISION OKAY
WE ARE SELLING IT TO AN EXISTING MARKET
THAT'S
YEAH AND AND YEAH AND AND WE'RE ALSO MARKETING A PRODUCT
IT'S WHAT I'M SEEING IS A IS A MID RANGE COST PRODUCT
SO SO W WE CAN'T GO AND PUMP A WHOLE BUNCH OF TECHNOLOGY INTO THIS THING BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE GONNA HAVE COST OVERRUNS
SO IF WE DROP IF WE ARE GONNA CHOOSE TO DROP TELETEXT AGAIN WHAT ARE WE ADDING TO THE PRODUCT THAT MAKES IT MARKETABLE
I DON'T I DON'T SEE IT
AND TO ME IF I'M GONNA MARKET A PRODUCT FOR B FOR BEAUTY FOR FOR DESIGN I'M GONNA I'M GONNA TRY TO MARKET IT AT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE
I NEED TO MAKE IT SPECIAL WITH A HIGH PRICE TAG
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY UH G UH COMPETITIVE
I WANT I WANT TO MARKET IT AS EXCLUSIVE
SO I WOULD MARKET THIS PRODUCT IT AT EIGHTY NINE EUROS AND COME UP WITH SOME REALLY BEAUTIFUL EXTERIOR DESIGN OR SOMETHING TH BUT BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY
NO I NO I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY BUT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M OKAY WE PROBABLY NEED TO MOVE ALONG BUT MY MY CONCERN IS TRYING TO FIND A MARKETING NICHE FOR THIS PRODUCT
AND IF I'M COMING IN WITH A WITH WITH TWENTY FIVE EUROS WHICH IS MID MARKET PRICE UM THEN WHAT AM I GOING TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE FOR THIS
SO THAT'S JUST MY QUESTION BUT WE CAN KEEP TALKING
YEAH
OH P PEDRO I JUST WANT TO SAY QUICKLY I I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT WHEN YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOME MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES EH
YOU KNOW SELL UH THINGS COME TO MY MIND IS UH UH SOMETHING THAT'S UH UM VOICE ACTIVATED
I KNOW WE'RE GETTING INTO SOME I HOPE SOME BIG MONEY ON THIS THING BUT
IS THAT FOR OVER HERE
OKAY ALRIGHT
THAT'S
'CAUSE UH AND I THINK OF VOICE ACTIVATED I THINK OF OF HOW MANY TIMES I'VE I'VE LOST MY MY REMOTE AND I CAN'T FIND IT
SO SOME WAY THAT I CAN I CAN FIND MY REMOTE BY CLAPPING MY HANDS OR SOMETHING UH AND AND SO SO UM BUT THIS 'S JUST SOMETHING
I'M TRYING TO FIND SOME BELLS AND WHISTLES 'CAUSE WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT TEL TAKING OUT TELETEXT IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE WE GONNA PUT IN
WHAT MAKES THIS THING ATTRACTIVE
AND IT'S ONLY FOR TELEVISIONS
SO WE EVERYTH OUR OUR COMPETITION OUT THERE HAS GOT THESE THESE MULTIPLE ADAPTORS WHERE THEY CAN USE 'EM FOR THEIR V. C. R. S
THEIR D. V. D. S THEIR THEIR TELEVISIONS AND WE'RE COMING OUT WITH ONE REMOTE FOR TELEVISION ONLY
AND SO TO ME WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS A REALLY SPECIAL PRODUCT I I I DON'T S I REALLY HAVE TO SAY I DON'T SEE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THIS PRODUCT
AT THIS PRICE I DON'T SEE IT YET
I'M I I GO ALONG WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GIVEN TO TRY TO MARKET BUT I I DON'T SEE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THIS PRODUCT
WITHOUT WITHOUT SOME REALLY SORT OF SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL TO IDENTIFY IT AS AS UNIQUE IN THE MARKET
YEAH
OKAY
HAVE TO DO YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN THE BOX
OKAY WELL SO SO THAT'S UP TO YOU THEN TO TO MAKE THIS BOX IN SOMETHING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY
MAYBE MAKE IT IN THE FORM OF A GUN
WE CAN SELL IT IN UNITED STATES
WELL YOU KNOW FOR MARKETING F MARKETING FOR ME IS UH AND UH HOW DO I GO HERE
OKAY
GO GO
IS THAT RIGHT
AH HA
YEAH WHAT FOR ME IS IT UM I D I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M MARKETING RIGHT NOW
OKAY 'TIL YOU SPOKE AND WHEN I WROTE THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M MARKETING
I JUST KNOW THAT I I WAS IDENTIFIED AS A A WE IDENTIFIED OURSELVES AS A AS A DEVELOPER
AS A MANUFACTURER AND AS A AS A UM DISTRIBUTOR T TO OTHER WHOLESALERS
AND SO THE TH THE TWENTY FIVE EUROS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS THE SALE PRICE IS A WHOLESALE PRICE RATHER THAN A RETAIL PRICE
THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDED HERE
UM SO WHAT I DID IS I I DECIDED THAT THAT THIS THIS NEEDS TO BE A PRODUCT IN A IN A SENSE CAN MARKET ITSELF
SO WHAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED HERE AS OUR MAIN MARKETING STRATAGEM IS IS IN DESIGN
WE'RE MAKING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ATTRACTIVE UH WHATEVER WE DECIDE IT IS
SO THAT MEANS WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN MORE MINUTES OR TEN MINUTES LEFT
UM SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PRODUCT THAT THAT WE CAN SELL EASILY
SO I SAY INSPIRATION SO HAVING SOMETHING BEAUTY SOMETHING ATTRACTIVE UH SOMETHING THAT IN A SENSE WILL SELL ITSELF
UH INNOVATION I THINK FITS INTO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WITH DESIGN
UH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE THAT THESE WERE IDEAS I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER
UM UNLESS WE COME UP WITH SOME NEW AGE PRODUCT A AS FAR AS THE CASING IS CONCERNED
I I WANNA MAKE THIS THING SOMETHING THAT I CAN IDENTIFY AS SPECIAL IN SOME WAY SO MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOME I I TALKED ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE
UH MAYBE WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN SOME WAY AS ADVANTAGEOUS IN A HOME
I DON'T KNOW
THESE ARE JUST THOUGHTS
UH I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT UH WHO WE ARE AS A AS A CORPORATION THAT WE'RE NEW WE'RE AGGRESSIVE
WE'RE COMPETITIVE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE A PRODUCT FROM A NEW PERSPECTIVE RATHER THAN FROM AN OLD CORPORATE LINE
SO TO ME IT'S ABOUT SELLING D UH OUR IDENTITY OUR CORPORATE IDENTITY ALONG WITH THE PRODUCT
UM WHAT I FOUND IS THAT THE PROJECTED COSTS ARE COMPETITIVE
UH WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MARKET BUT WHAT I'M SEEING IS THAT THE MARKET IS READY FOR I I IDENTIFIED NEW TECHNOLOGY
BUT AGAIN BECAUSE WHAT I SEE IS BUDGET RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN BRING ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO THIS THING
IF IF WE COULD HAVE A TECHNOLOGICAL SOMETHING
MM P PLEASE
SOLAR
BUT SOLAR
BLAH I LIKE IT
I LIKE THE IDEA BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN COST IS GONNA PROBABLY DOUBLE
BUT BOY WE CAN SELL THIS THING BECAUSE THERE'S NO BATTERIES IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE I WE CAN IDENTIFY IT AS A SAFER PRODUCT IN SOME FORM
YEP THAT'S RIGHT
I REALLY SEE BUT THE COST I
NO NO
NO NO WE HAVE T WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE END COST
THERE'S UH I MEAN I DON'T SEE IT ANYWAY
YEAH THAT'S GONNA BE UP TO THESE GUYS
I MY REACTION IS NO BUT
WELL SEE I I SEE I I'M AN ADVOCATE TO MAKE THIS AN EXCLUSIVE PRODUCT
YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S SELL THIS WHOLESALE FOR FOR FIFTY EUROS SIXTY EUROS
LET'S MAKE THIS THING REALLY EXCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE UH HIGH TECH DESIGN UH ERGONOMICS ALL OF THIS
JUST MAKE THIS THING UH YEAH THE THE THE ROLLS ROYCE OF OF REMOTE CONTROLS
EVERY HOME'S GOT TO HAVE IT
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE HEY WHAT KIND OF REMOTE DO YOU HAVE
OH YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE OH FANTASTIC I WANT ONE OF THOSE TOO
I JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY RIGHT NOW
YEP ONE ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS H THEY'VE THEY'VE GIVEN US THIS PACKAGE OKAY
NOW UH IN MY OPINION WE NEED TO GIVE THEM A PACKAGE BACK OKAY
THEY SAY THEY SAY OKAY HERE YOU GO
THEY GAVE US A FUNDAMENT A FOUNDATION OF OF WHAT THEY WANT AND AND W IT'S OUR PLACE TO KINDA ANALYSE AND EVALUATE
I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR PLACE TO CREATE THEIR PRODUCT FOR THEM MAYBE IT IS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF ROLE WE HAVE IN THIS IN THE CORPORATE LADDER UH
BUT TO ME IT'S LIKE OKAY YOU HAVE GOT YOUR HERE'S OUR IDEAS OKAY
AND THEN LET THEM LOOK AT THOSE IDEAS AND THEY SAY YEAH WELL
WE CAN WE CAN RAISE THE PRICE TWENTY PERCENT YOU KNOW WE LIKE THIS IDEA THIS IDEA NO
BUT TO ME IT'S IT'S ABOUT A CHOICE DO WE FOLLOW THEIR DIRECTIVES OR DO WE MAKE UH PRESENTATIONS BACK AND AND THEN AND THEN DISCUSS
BECA I I DO NOT I DO NOT SEE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE HANDING F HANDING US RIGHT NOW
I DON'T SEE IT
RIGHT
NO I UNDERSTAND THAT
NOPE THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THE PRODUCT AS NOT WORKING FOR ANYTHING BUT TELEVISIONS
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THIS PRODUCT LIMITA THAT'S WHY I SAY I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE MARKET NICHE FOR THIS
IF WE IF W IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PRODUCT THAT WORKED FOR D. V. D. S V. C. R. S AND EVERYTHING
THEN I CAN SEE THE MARKET NICHE BUT WE WE'RE ONLY IDENTIFIED AS GOING FOR TELEVISIONS WITHOUT TELETEXT
AND IT'S LIKE WHOA WE HA IN MY OPINION WE HAVE TO GO WITH SOMETHING THAT'S EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE TO MAKE THIS THING MARKETABLE
BECAUSE WHO WANTS JUST A TELEVISION REMOTE
I DON'T
THAT'S RIGHT
I I I HAVE A TENDENCY TO AGREE WITH YOU
I REALLY DO
THAT'S WHY I SAY I QUEST I Q I QUESTION THE MARKETABILITY OF THE PRODUCT
I REALLY QUESTION WHERE WE CREATE THE DEMAND
W OKAY IF YOU IF YOU DROP THE COST NOW IF YOU MAKE IF YOU MAKE GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COST SCALE
AND YOU MAKE IT LESS EXPENSIVE THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW WE'RE GOING INTO AN A A NEW MARKET AREA
SO WE CAN SAY LOW COST UH UH UM UH GOOD DESIGN BEAUTIFUL WA DA DA DA DA DA
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS RIGHT NOW WE'RE MIDDLE MARKET
YEAH FOR FOR MULTI FOR A MULTI FUNCTION REMOTE THAT'S A MID MARKET PRICE
IN A DISCOUNT RIGHT NOW YOU CAN BUY 'EM ON SALE SOMETIMES FOR ABOUT ABOUT UH EIGHTEEN
NINETEEN EURO AND THAT'S FOR THE MULTI FUNCTIONS UH D. V. D. V. C. R. UH CATCH ALLS
AND AND THEY HAVE 'EM IN A LITTLE BOX IN THE MIDDLE AND AND THIS IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROLS
SO TO ME TO MARKET THIS A T ONLY A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL WE HAVE TO CHANGE CONSCIOUSNESS
WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WILL CHANGE PEOPLE'S THINKING TO IDENTIFY THIS AS ADVANTAGEOUS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS
IT'S GOTTA BE LOW COST OR HIGH COST WITH WITH SPECIAL DESIGN FEATURES
OR MY D
I MEAN I I WELL WE G WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER END NOW
I LIKE IT
I LIKE THE IDEA BUT WE HAVE T WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WELL
MM
WELL I THINK AGAIN IT'S IT WE HAVE A COST ISSUE HERE
YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA GO IN THIS DIRECTION TO ME WE'RE GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COST RANGE
ARE WE GONNA MAKE THIS SELLING SELLING THE COST AS A HIGH HIGH TECH UH UM ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE WHATEVER
OR ARE WE GONNA GO TO THE LOWER SIDE OF THE RANGE
AGAIN I DON'T SEE OUR MARKET NICHE IN THE MIDDLE FOR OUR PRODUCT YET
I DON'T SEE IT YET
W A QUESTION I HAVE IN IN A 'CAUSE I I I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU ON WE GOTTA MAKE IT A BOX
THE BOX IS GONNA SELL IT I THINK THE OUTSIDE THE CASING
CAN CAN CAN WE HAVE MULTIPLE DESIGNS
HAVE A MODERN HAVE A TRADITIONAL HAVE A YOU KNOW AND SO SO INSTEAD OF THEM ALL LOOKING THE SAME
PEOPLE CAN HAVE MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT DESIGNS THEY CAN CHOOSE FROM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT CREATES COST OR
YEP ONE OVER ANOTHER
YEAH OKAY I HEAR THAT
WHAT AB WHAT AB WHAT ABOUT A
A REMOTE THAT'S THAT DOESN'T MAYBE LOOK LIKE A REMOTE
JUST AN IDEA
JUST JUST OKAY 'CAUSE I MEAN WE ALL KNOW WHAT A REMOTE LOOKS LIKE ON THE OUTSIDE
THEY'RE SELLING THESE THINGS EVERYWHERE
MAYBE THAT COULD BE PART OF OUR DESIGN EXCLUSIVITY IS WE MAKE A REMOTE THAT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE A REMOTE IT IT OPENS LIKE A TELEPHONE
DOESN'T MATTER YEAH
I'M JUST JUS I TALKING ABOUT SOME SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS THING UNIQUE
IT THAT'S THE THING I'M GONNA KEEP THUMPING ON
I'LL SELL WHATEVER YOU GUYS DESIGN
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM SELLING A PRODUCT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE
I GIVE YOU IDEAS YOU GUYS CREATE THE PRODUCT
ONCE YOU HAVE THE FINISHED PRODUCT I'LL FIND A WAY TO SELL IT
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
I JUST GIVE YOU THESE THINGS NOW BECAUSE THESE ARE MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS
NO NO
ONE THING I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE SAYING THAT
IS THAT THE P OUR TARGET MARKET IS GONNA BE SOMEONE WHO HAS LOST OR BROKEN WE GOTTA STOP
WHO'S LOST OR BROKEN THEIR THEIR REMOTE
SO HOW MANY REMOTES DO THEY WANNA BUY
CAN WE P CAN WE SELL THEM A REMOTE THAT CAN MAYBE GUARANTEE THEY WILL NOT NEED TO BUY ANOTHER ONE
AND SO WITH WITH WITH THIS KIND OF SYSTEM OR LOCATOR OR SOMETHING TO TO THINK ABOUT HOW HAVE PEOPLE BEEN BEEN LOSING OR BREAKING THEIR REMOTE
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN
AND AND THEN AND THEN DESIGN THE PRODUCT MAYBE SOME COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT THAT CAN IDENTIFY THIS AS THE LAST ONE YOU'LL EVER NEED TO BUY
UH WE CAN MAKE IT IN THE SHAPE OF A COFFEE POT
IT'S UH JUST IT'S THAT I THINK IT'S TELLING US TO STOP OUR MEETING
SO WE HAVE THE C WE PROBABLY HAVE HAVE ON LINE IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEM WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A CHARGING SYSTEM
IF IF WE CAN CREATE THIS WE HAVE PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN REALLY STRONG MARKETING CHARACTERISTICS
NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT I WANT
OH LOOK IT HERE
AFTERNOON GUYS
IT'S GONNA BE
OH
'KAY
WE MAY DO
I DUNNO I'M FEELING LIKE A BIG BOY
'KAY READY TO GO
'KAY SO WE'VE GOT OUR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
HOPEFULLY WE'VE ALL GOT EXCITING IDEAS NOW
UH K EXCITING IDEAS
'KAY SO HERE'S OUR AGENDA OUR AGENDA
UM
I'M GONNA OPEN
I'M GONNA TALK FOR A BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
I'M GONNA TAKE SOME NOTES
WE'RE GONNA ALL DO A PRESENTATION AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME DECISIONS NOW
YEP
WELL WHEN I SAY HOPEFULLY WE HAVE TO
SO
I'M GONNA LET YOU GUYS TALK BEFORE WE MAKE DECISIONS
AND DOES ANYONE REALLY WANT TO GO FIRST
YOU P TWO
WHAT'S
COMPONENTS DESIGN
YOUR NAME IS NAME
HUH HI NAME
RIGHT
WE'VE ALL BROKE A REMOTE CONTROL RI UM S YEAH
YOU PRESS THIS AND IT DOES TH
I DUNNO WHO AND WHATNOT
'KAY
OKAY
'KAY
MM 'KAY
OKAY SO WE BASICALLY HAVE BATTERY VERSUS CRADLE HERE
OKAY
SO WE HAVE BATTERY VERSUS CRADLE
IT'S ACTUALLY A NOVEL THING BECAUSE YOU COULD SELL IT A AS A NOVELTY JUST TO BE ACTUALLY SERIOUS FOR A MINUTE HERE YOU COULD
MM
HMM
WOOD WOOD WOULD GE WOULD GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A MARKETING NICHE WOULDN'T IT
NAH
OKAY
HMM
OKAY
'KAY
DO YOU GET A GOOD GRIP ON THE RUBBER
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
I THINK IT MIGHT MEAN SOMETHING LIKE THAT SORTA SHAPE BECAUSE A DOUBLE CURVE RATHER THAN A YEAH THAT'S WHAT
OKAY
D DO WE HAVE ACTUALLY ANY CONCEPT OF WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN A SIMPLE CHIP AND AN ADVANCED CHIP
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
SO PRESENTATION FROM
I GUESS DESIGN WOULD GO BEST
NEXT
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OR INTERFACE CONCEPT
YEAH THAT'S IT
YES BUT IT HAS YOUR NAME ON IT
BUT WHAT IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO PRESS A BUTTON TO MAKE IT RECOGNIZE
SO IF YOU PRESSED IT AND WENT UP
MAN YEAH
BUT IF IT'S JUST ONE THING WITH A BUTTON THAT YOU CAN JUST GO
UP
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
YOU GUYS KNOW YOUR STUFF
MM
SO WE'RE SUGGESTING DOING A SORTA SCROLL WHEEL THING FOR THE VOLUME
NAH
OH OKAY OKAY
I SEE
UH OKAY
OKAY
'KAY
SO ON TO
Y FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OR TREND WATCHING
FORTY SIX NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN
YEP
MM
UPPER MANAGEMENT SAID YES
UH E EXCUSE THAT THAT'S A BIT OF SPAM
IT'S COOL
I'D I'D SAY THOUGH THAT WE IF WE DID MAKE THE DECISION TO GO WITH THE CRADLE THOUGH
THE THEN WE HAVE THAT AS WELL BUT WI WITH A SIMILAR
MM
COURSE
YEAH 'CAUSE THAT'S
MM
MM 'KAY
SO NOW
SO OUR BIG QUESTIONS HERE REALLY ARE
CRADLE OR NOT CRADLE
DO WE GO BASIC OR DO WE GO FOR FEATURES
UH D DOES ANYONE REALLY WANNA DO ANYTHING WITH THE SCROLL WHEEL OR SHOULD WE DITCH THAT OFF HAND FIRST
OH BUT THAT WAS IN YOUR PRESENTATION SO WH WHAT WOULD YOU IMAGINE IT DOING
MM 'KAY
YEAH
WHAT I UNDERSTAND ABOUT SCROLL WHEELS IS THEY'RE THEY'RE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO TO MAKE
SO I D
WELL I D I LIKE THE IDEA OF BASICALLY FOCUSING THE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS FOCUSING THE P THE PRODUCT ON THE IDEA OF THE UH THE CASE THE THE UH
DOCK TO PUT IT IN TO TO CHARGE IT
WE CAN TARGET LIKE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY IDEAS THAT SORTA THINGS
IT S I M MAKES IT EASY TO MARKET IT'S EASY TO DIFFERENTIATE THE PRODUCT YEAH SO
AND IF WE WE KEEP THE REST IN A FORMAT THAT IS DURABLE BECAUSE TH TH THE WHOLE PRODUCT'S GONNA NEED TO BE MORE DURABLE TH THUS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE DITCHING IT AS OFTEN
IT'S GONNA NEED TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF THE CRADLE
SO IF WE CAN MARKET IT IN TERMS OF THAT AND YEAH WELL
SO OUR BIG DECISION THEN IS LIKE HOW DO WE DO UM LIKE WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE DETAILS AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WELL N NOT EXACTLY THE DETAILS
BUT D DO WE HAVE UH
WHAT TYPE OF CASING
I PERSONALLY LIKE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT THE PLASTIC WITH THE RUBBER
OKAY
JUST A VERY THIN SORTA SHEET FOR A A GRIP SORTA THING OR FOR
OKAY
SO THEN IF WE D D DO WE WANT TO DO ANYTHING MORE BASIC WITH THE UH MORE ADVANCED WITH THE USER INTERFACE IN TERMS OF DO WE WANT TO GO FOR UM BUTTONS
OR DO WE WANT IF WE'RE DITCHING THE SCROLL WHEELS DO WE WANT TO GO L. C. D.
DO WE WANT TO GIVE DO WE WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING ELSE ON IT
OKAY
OKAY SO THE QUESTION IS NOW I GUESS WE NEED T TO
DECIDE ON WELL Y YOU GUYS BASICALLY HAVE TO NOW GO AND
FIGURE OUT THE DETAILS OF THIS THING
SO
WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IN TERMS OF MARKETING AND UH PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARE ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER NOW BEFORE YOU GUYS CAN GO AND BUILD THIS
WHAT WHAT OVERALL THINGS HAVE WE NOT DECIDED ON
I THINK MAYBE IN TERMS OF MARKETING IS THAT GONNA MAKE ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE TO JUSTIFY THE COST
YEAH AND I GUESS TH TH THE QUESTION TH TH THAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER IS THE DOCK ENOUGH OF A UNIQUE FEATURE TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND SELL THAT A A AS A A VERY DIFFERENT PRODUCT
OR DO WE REALLY NEED THE SCROLL WHEEL AS WELL
BECAUSE THE SCROLL WHEEL COMES AT QUITE A COST
THAT'S GONNA N IS THAT GONNA NEED A BETTER CHIP AS WELL
AND IT'S PRESUMABLY GONNA NEED A LITTLE SPEAKER IN IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS WELL TO BEEP
BUT I GUESS A LITTLE TINY SPEAKER IS GONNA BE QUITE CHEAP IT'S NOT GONNA NEED Q QUALITY IS IT
IT'S
MAKES YOUR LIVING ROOM MORE FRESH AS YOU WATCH
OKAY WE'RE DOING WELL FOR TIME HERE
UM WE'VE GOT ABOUT ANOTHER TEN MINUTES
I THINK THAT UH
MM PR MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS OUT
I DON'T THINK THE COST IS JUSTIFIED FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE UNIQUENESS WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE THAT
AND I DON'T S THINK IT'S OBVIOUS AND NATURAL HOW IT WOULD BE USED
MM
BUT THEN THAT THAT SURELY D DEPENDS A LITTLE ON THE T. V. BECAUSE SOME T. V. S ARE QUITE SLOW AT CHANGING CHANNELS FROM LIKE SO IF YOU'VE GOT A SCROLL WHEEL AND YOU S YOU HAVE TO SCROLL SCROLL IT REALLY REALLY SLOWLY JUST SO THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY KEEPING IN PACE WITH THE T. V. 'S ABILITY TO TO CHANGE CHANNELS
OR DO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND YOU WAIT FOR IT
YOU SCROLL IT A BUNCH OF TIMES AND YOU WAIT FOR IT TO
MM
UH I SEE I SEE
THAT'S WHERE YOU
AH I SEE I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW
OKAY
YEAH IF YOU'RE JUST SITTING THERE GOING
THAT'S KINDA COOL ACTUALLY
I LIKE THAT
WELL NOT N NECESSARILY
YOU COULD BASICALLY MAKE IT SO THAT IT'LL I MEAN IT'S JUST GONNA BE SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE T. V. YEAH THE T. V. 'S GE SO IF YOU SEND ABOUT FIVE FLIP CHANNELS
IF YOU DID THAT IT'S GONNA FLIP ONCE
IF YOU DO THAT
OTHER THAN CLICK CLICK CLICK
YEAH
AND IF WE'RE MARKETING IT AS A HIGH NICHE PRODUCT THEN WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING GOOD T. V. S AS WELL YEAH PRESUMABLY
PRIMARILY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH I SEE SO IF MAYBE IF WE HAD AN L. C. D. UP THE TOP THAT JUST DID A NUMBER ON IT RIGHT
AND THEN IT THAT BASICALLY
MM
WELL THAT'S QUITE COOL
YOU'D NEED A DISPLAY ON THE TH THE THING
OH YEAH YEAH NO I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
YEAH THAT'S KINDA COOL
HOW WOULD YOU PROGRAM IT THOUGH
OKAY OKAY
OKAY AND YEAH AND THAT JUST BASICALLY FLIPS BETWEEN IT AND IT'LL GO IT SENDS OUT ZERO
FIVE AND THEN THIRTY SIX AND THEN ZERO ONE AGAIN
YEAH THAT'S KINDA COOL
I LIKE THAT
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE TOO EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA BE YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO NAB THAT OFF OF COMPUTER MOUSE MANUFACTURERS REALLY
YOU COULD BASICALLY COME UP WITH A PARTNERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THAT QUITE CHEAPLY
MIGHT BE BUT THA THAT'S NOT GONNA BE SUCH A COSTLY FEATURE
THE PROBLEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE IS MAKING IT ROBUST
MAKING IT LAST
SO IF THERE'S A BUTTON FOR EACH TYPE
YEAH PEOPLE ARE GONNA HAVE THEIR FAVOURITE SORTA WHETHER THEY DO THAT OR WHETHER THEY
YEAH YEAH THE MODE SWITCH
JUST THE LIGHTS BEHIND THE BUTTONS
YOU COULD HAVE BACK LIT BUTTONS MAYBE
WOULD THAT WORK
IS THAT OKAY WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES
SO RIGHT DETAILS TH THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE ARE THAT WE WANT A SCROLL WHEEL
WE WANT A MODE INDICATOR
WE WANT BACK LIT BUTTONS
AND IF WE'RE MAKING BACK LIT BUTTONS PERIOD
DO WE WANT THAT JUST FOR THE MODE INDICATOR OR MAYBE TO INDICATE WHAT BUTTON YOU'RE PRESSING AT THE TIME
SO THAT YOU KNOW IF IT'S ACTUALLY PRESSED OR NOT
I'VE SEEN SOME REMOTES DO THAT
I THINK WE ARE YEAH
YEAH WELL WE DON'T HAVE IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE MORE MONEY WE CAN PUSH UP THE THE PRICE
YEAH
'KAY
YEAH
SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE SURE AS TO WHAT WE CAN PUSH THE COST UP TO
THOUGH WE HAVEN'T GOT TO A STAGE WHERE WE'RE READY TO PIN DOWN THE PRICE OF COMPONENTS
BUT I'D SAY WHAT SORTA PRICE ARE WE LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO SELL SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WHAT SORTA PRICE CAN WE MAKE IT FOR
YEAH NO I I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY SHOULD BE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE AS WE SAID IN THE LAST MEETING
OUR MANAGEMENT IS REALLY LOOKING FOR US TO PUSH OUR BRAND
WE'RE ENTERING A NEW MARKET HERE SO I THINK THE THE PROFIT EXPECTATION FOR THIS ONE PRODUCT IS MAYBE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS BEING ABLE TO
BUT TH WHAT'S OUR BALLPARK AS TO WHAT WE'D BE ABLE TO SELL SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA THINK WHO OUR TARGET MARKET IS BECAUSE I I'M NOT OUR TARGET MARKET
I'M A STUDENT BUT
ON THE OTHER HAND I WOULD THINK
MM WITH MY PROJECT MANAGER SALARY I WOULD THINK YEAH I COULD PROBABLY AFFORD THIS UH WOULD I BUY IT
MAYBE
IF I HAD A COOL NEW T. V. AND THIS WAS R LOOKING REALLY SLICK AND IT HAD THE DOCK AND IT HAD THE SCROLL WHEEL
WHICH I THINK'S A REALLY COOL IDEA THAT WOULD SELL ME ON IT A LITTLE
THEN MAYBE YOU KNOW
I DO I DON'T THINK I'D GO OVER A HUNDRED EURO CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE WAY TOO MUCH
BUT THE I WOULD BE HAPPY PAYING OVER FORTY FOR IT I GUESS BUT NOT MUCH
'KAY
THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY EUROS IS OUR SALES BRACKET OKAY
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE CA WE MAKE IT FOR
MM
THAT'S WHY THE SCROLL NEEDS TO BE REALLY ROBUST
YEP
OKAY
THE NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES ALTHOUGH DOES IT
IT STARTS AT THREE TWENTY ONE THE NEXT MEETING
SO WE'VE GOT MORE THAN A THIRTY MINUTES
UM WE'VE GOT MORE LIKE FIFTY
THE THE NE NEXT MEETING IS THREE TWENTY ONE YEAH
YEAH THAT IS
UH THEY'VE THEY'VE CHANGED THE TIMES FROM THE PRESENTATIONS
OKAY SO YOU GUYS WILL BE GETTING YOUR MODELLING DONE NOW AND UH
OKAY ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO WHAT THIS THING'S GONNA DO LOOK LIKE
HOW IT'S GONNA WORK THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE WE REALLY LOOK AT THIS IN A LOT OF DETAIL
OKAY
OKAY
THIS ONE WAS QUITE EASY
ALWAYS THE OPTIMIST
'KAY THANKS GUYS
ALRIGHT WELL WE GOT SOME EXCITING STUFF FOR YOU GUYS
OR NOT
ALL READY
WE DO
ALRIGHT
I GUESS I'LL GO FIRST
YEAH
COMPONENT I THINK
YEAH
YEP THAT'S IT
MY NAME IS
MY NAME IS NAME
SORRY I DID THIS IN A BIT OF A RUSH
SO SO HERE'S A LOOK INSIDE YOUR REALLY OLD LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL
UM YOU'VE GOT A PRINTED A PRINTED UH CIRCUIT BOARD HERE
AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE BUTTONS WHICH KINDA PRESS DOWN LITTLE RUBBER NUBBIES INTO THESE LITTLE HOLES THAT ACTIVATE
YEAH WE'VE ALL BROKEN A REMOTE CONTROL
SO YOU'VE ALSO GOT UM YOU'VE GOT YOUR CHIP HERE YOUR BATTERIES HERE AND SOME SORTA ELECTRONICS
UM
WELL SO YOU'VE GOT HERE'S HERE'S A TRANSISTOR AND THIS AMPLIFIES YOUR SIGNAL
UM YOU'VE GOT THE L. E. D. HERE ON THE END OF THE UH UH ON THE END OF THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD
UM YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE DIODES HERE FOR I DON'T KNOW WHO AND WHATNOT
SO EXACTLY
SO UM WE'VE GOT A I IN THIS IN THIS UH DRAWING HE UH IN THIS EXAMPLE HERE THIS IS A EIGHTEEN PIN UM UH CHIP I DUNNO
UH IT'S TWO DOUBLE A. BATTERIES
THIS IS PRETTY STANDARD REMOTE
SO HERE ARE OPTIONS FOR OUR POWER SOURCES
YOU CAN USE A BASIC BATTERY WHICH WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED
UM TH OUR TECH DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID WE HAVE THE OPTION OF DOING SOME KIND OF HAND DYNAMO WHERE MAYBE YOU CRANK IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S REALLY I DON'T KNOW WE GOT SOME QU CRAZY GUYS DOWN THERE IN THAT DEPARTMENT SO
YOU SHAKE IT
YEAH
SO THAT'S THE NEXT BULLET IS THE UM THE KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY SO IT'S LIKE THAT FLASHLIGHT WHERE YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT
UH WE'VE GOT SOLAR CELLS
WHICH I DON'T THINK IS A VERY GOOD IDEA BECAUSE UM YOU COULD NOT USE YOUR REMOTE AT NIGHT WHICH DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE
AND FINALLY WE'VE GOT OUR CRADLE O OUR POWER CRADLE IDEA
M BATTERY VERSUS CRADLE I THINK IS YEAH
IT COULD BE FUN
YEAH
WELL IT IS IT IS MORE UH I MEAN IT IS MORE ECO FRIENDLY THAN THE THAN THE CRADLE 'CAUSE YOU'RE STILL USING POWER OFF THE GRID WITH THE CRADLE
SO UM
OUR CASE DESIGN
WE HAVE UH CHOICES IN MATERIALS AND CHOICES IN THE GENERAL SHAPES THAT WE CAN DO
OUR MATERIAL CHOICES ARE A PLASTIC LATEX UM TY OR PLASTIC A RUBBER LATEX TYPE THING UH WOOD OR TITANIUM
IF WE GO WITH TITANIUM WE'RE GONNA BE UH LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF SHAPES WE CAN DO BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH TO SHAPE THE TITANIUM AND UH
YEAH PERS
I THINK WOOD I I I CAN'T SEE ANYBODY WANTING TO USE A WOODEN REMOTE IT'S JUST ANTI TECHNOLOGY REALLY YOU KNOW
RIGHT
AND WHAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO AND I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST OPTION IS TO COMBINE SOME A COUPLE OF THESE
UM MY RECOMMENDATION PERSONALLY WOULD BE TO DO SOME KIND OF A PLASTIC INNER SHELL WITH A LIKE A RUBBER OUTER SHELL
TO MAKE IT UM TO MAK UH LIKE A THICK PLASTIC INNER SHELL AND A T UM KIND OF A TO HAVE THAT RUBBER OUTER SHELL TO MAKE IT MORE DURABLE
AND ALSO MAYBE I I THINK IT FEELS A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE PLASTIC
YEAH UM
YEAH
THE ADVANTAGES OF WORKING WITH PLASTIC AND RUBBER IS W WE WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE UM OPTIONS JUST IN TERMS OF SHAPE BECAUSE YOU CAN EXTRUDE PLASTIC IN BASICALLY ANY SHAPE YOU WANT
SO UM AND THEN WE CAN COVER YOU KNOW THE BREAKABLE BITS WITH RUBBER YEAH SO UM
BUT BASICALLY THESE ARE CURVED AND DOUBLE CURVED I I BELIEVE THAT THE TECH DEPARTMENT
IN THEIR UM IN THEIR MESSAGE TO ME THAT THEY WERE REFERRING TO THE NUMBER OF TH CURVES IN THE BOTTOM
I HAVE NO IDEA EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME UNCURVED FLAT CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED
I WOULD GUESS THIS LIKE THIS PEN WOULD BE KINDA LIKE A DOUBLE CURVED WHERE IT'S CURVED ON M M MULTIPLE AXES RIGHT
I THINK CURVED MEANS JUST CURVED IN ONE AXIS AND DOUBLE CURVED IS CURVED IN TWO AXES
OR SURFACES
I HAVE NO IDEA
OH OKAY OH LIKE A WAVE OKAY
ALRIGHT THAT MAKES SENSE OKAY
UM OKAY WITH THE INTERFACE WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS WE CAN U WE CAN USE PUSH BUTTONS
WE CAN USE A SCROLL WHEEL WITH AN INTEGRATED PUSH BUTTON AND L. C. D. DISPLAY OR MULTIPLE SCROLLING WHEELS
UM SO THESE ARE ALL OPTIONS THAT THE USER INTERFACE GUY CAN UH HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL TO PUT TOGETHER A USER INTERFACE
FOR ELECTRONICS WE HAVE THESE VERY TECHNICAL UM DESCRIPTIONS HERE
A SIMPLE CHIP WHICH IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE BUT I HAVE NO NUMBERS TO GIVE YOU A REGULAR CHIP
WHICH IS LIKE THE MEDIUM PORRIDGE THE MEDIUM EXPENSE UH
YES THE DIFFERENCE IS WITH A SIMPLE CHIP A SIMPLE CHIP WILL OPERATE OH WHY DOESN'T THIS SCROLL UP
PREVIOUS PREVIOUS OKAY
A SIMPLE CHIP IS REQUIRED TO OPERATE PUSH BUTTONS
UM AN ADVANCED CHIP IS REQUIRED TO TO OPERATE UM THE L. C. D. DISPLAY AND IT DIDN'T SAY SPECIFICALLY
BUT I I HAVE A HUNCH THAT A REGULAR CHIP IS GONNA BE THE SCROLL WHEEL AND THE MULTIPLE SCROLL WHEELS
SO BUT YEAH
THAT'S THE END OF MY PRESENTATION
I THINK
NO
IF THE T. V. IS WORKING YEAH
THAT'S JUST I MEAN IT'LL IF SOMEBODY SAYS UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A
TELEVISION SHOW IT'S GONNA CHANGE THE CHANNEL
SO
WELL THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST PRESS THE UP BUTTON
EVEN STILL THERE'S GONNA BE INTERF TH THERE'S THERE STILL WILL BE INTERFERENCE FROM THE T. V.
IT MIGHT NOT BE IT MIGHT NOT BE COMPLETELY CONFUSING BUT I THINK YOU'LL STILL Y IT'S STILL I DON'T THINK IT'S PRACTICAL AT ALL
I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA FRANKLY
THAT I WOULD BELIEVE
MM-HMM
THAT'S NOT A SCROLL WHEEL
RIGHT
INSTEAD OF PLAY STOP REWIND AND FAST FORWARD THERE THAT'S UP DOWN LOUDER AND QUIETER
TREND WATCHING HAS A LATER DATE THERE
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE PICTURE
THAT'S NOT OUR THAT'S NOT OUR B DESIGN
THAT'S JUST A THAT'S JUST SOMETHING HE A A GRAPHIC HE USED TO SHOW YOU THE LAYOUT OF WHAT THE LAYOUT OF THE BUTTONS MIGHT BE LIKE
WHAT'S SPECIAL AND UNIQUE ABOUT A SCROLL
WELL RIGHT I THINK THE TWO BIG TH POINTS THAT WE HAVE SO FAR ARE THE HAVING THE CRADLE AND ALSO HAVING UH THE UM THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE UH CASE ITSELF HAVING LIKE THIS LIKE RUBBER SHELL MAYBE WITH A PLASTIC INTERIOR
HAVING IT LOOK REALLY NICE UM AND ALSO BE REALLY DURABLE
RIGHT YEAH
YEAH
WELL LET'S GET A PRODUCT THEN
WELL MY QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD THE SCROLL WHEEL DO
FUNCTION WISE WHAT DOES THAT DO THAT
YEAH
WELL IT'S IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING THAT THE BUTTONS DO
YEAH
TH THEY ARE GONNA BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I MEAN IT
I MEAN IT IS AN ALTERNATIVE IF IF YOU THINK THAT'S GONNA SELL SOME SOME UH YOU KNOW IF IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE UP THE EXTRA COST BY EXTRA SALES I THINK MAYBE IT'S WORTH IT TO DO IT
BUT I MEAN I WOULD JUST USE IF I WAS GONNA DO THIS I WOULD JUST USE THE SCROLL WHEEL FOR S CHANNELS UP AND CHANNELS DOWN
I DON'T THINK VOLUME OR DO YOU THINK VOLUME WOULD BE
NO WE CAN WE CAN DO MULTIPLE SCROLL WHEELS BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
I'M THINKING YEAH SOMETHING LIKE KINDA ALMOST LIKE THESE PENS YOU KNOW
WHERE THERE'S YOU HAVE PLASTIC BITS AND THEN IT'S NOT REALLY RUBBER BUT JUST KINDA LIKE A FUSED THE PLASTIC WITH RUBBER ON THE OUTSIDE
WELL NO MA YEAH MAYBE A BIT MORE THEN TH IS ON HERE BUT JU JUST AS A KIND OF AN INSPIRATION
THESE PENS I THINK ARE ARE KIND OF
OR FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK L. C. D. IS A MISTAKE BECAUSE THIS IS A UNIVERSAL REMOTE AND ALL YOU'RE DOING I MEAN IT'S YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY INFORMATION BACK FROM THE TELEVISION
SO THE ONLY INFORMATION YOU CAN DISPLAY ON THIS REMOTE IS WHAT CHANNEL YOU JUST SENT IT AT LAST AND THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION
YOU KNOW THERE
IT RECEIVES NO INFORMATION
SO I I DON'T SEE ANY REASON FOR HAVING AN L. C. D. 'CAUSE IT'S AN INCREASED COST
UNLESS YOU CAN THINK OF SOMETHING INTERESTING TO DO WITH IT
RIGHT
WELL WE HAVE TO I THINK FOR ME IT'S STILL NOT EXACTLY CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE INTER USER INTERFACE IS GONNA BE
THERE'S THE SCROLL WHEEL IN OR OUT
WHAT DO YOU GUYS LIKE IN THE USER INTERFACE
WELL I DUNNO ABOUT LIKE THE FLIP PHONE IDEA BECAUSE I THINK AS FAR AS DURABILITY TH IT'S NOT A BIG WELL MAYBE WHEN IT'S CLOSED
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL
THE
THE LOCATOR'S GONNA REQUIRE A RADIO TRANSMITTER WHICH WILL
UM WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH A LIKE A MEDIUM CHIP S I WOULD IMAGINE
BUT WE I WE WILL NEED A RECEIVER AN ANTENNA
YEAH
IT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE SIGNAL THOUGH SO
THAT'S TRUE YEAH
OH YEAH YEAH
IT'LL BE REALLY CHEAP
SO THE SCROLL WHEEL
IN OR OUT
FOR ME I THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL ACTUALLY MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE INCREASED COST IS GONNA BE BUT I THINK HE DOES HAVE A POINT
I IT MIGHT PUSH SOMEBODY OVER THE EDGE WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT OUR AT OUR REMOTE VERSUS SOMETHING ELSE
WHEN THEY SEE THIS ONE HAS A SCROLL WHEEL TO GO UP AND DOWN ON THE CHANNELS
I THINK IT MIGHT BE KINDA NEAT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT LIKE THAT
SURE
WELL I THINK WH WHAT IT WOULD BE IS LIKE LIKE THE M LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S MAYBE YOU KNOW A DIGITAL
WHEEL RIGHT WHERE IT'S WHERE IT'S QUANTIZED INTO YOU KNOW CERTAIN
THAT WAS THAT WAS MY MY INTUITION OF WHAT THE SCROLL WHEEL WOULD BE
IT'S JUST IT'S BASICALLY IT IT'S JUST A F LOOK AND FEEL THING
IT HAS THE SAME EXACT FUNCTIONALITY AS TWO BUTTONS
YEAH
NOW JUST JUST SO YOU KNOW THOUGH UH YOU DID BRING UP A POINT WHICH IS VERY VALID
IS A LOT OF T. V. S WON'T RE THE T. V. S WON'T RESPOND EXACTLY THE SAME
SOME OF THEM ARE GONNA BE KINDA SLOW SWITCHING SO YOU MAY LIKE QUEUE UP LIKE FIFTEEN CHANNEL CHANGES AND IT'LL BE LIKE FLIP FLIP FLIP
BUT
RIGHT
YEAH IT JUST MIGHT BE FRUSTRATING WHERE YOU CAN'T MAKE IT GO AS FAST AS YOU WANT
BUT I THINK ONCE PEOPLE GET USED TO IT I I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF THE SCROLL WHEEL THOUGH
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT BE GETTING AT OR OR
WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS WHAT ABOUT IF YOU CAN PROGRAMME IN YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS INTO THIS SCROLL WHEEL AND YOU CAN JUST LIKE ROLL THROUGH YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS
AND IT C IT
WHY
IT'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU FLIP THE CHANNEL ON THE T. V.
YEAH
WELL YOU JUST IT'S ONE EXTRA BUTTON
YOU SAY PROGRAMME START AND THEN TYPE IN 'CAUSE YOU STILL HAVE THE TYPING YOU KNOW YOU'LL STILL HAVE THE KEYPAD WHERE YOU CAN TYPE 'EM IN MANUALLY
SO PROGRAMME START ZERO ONE ENTER ZERO FIVE ENTER THIRTY EIGHT ENTER PROGRAMME END
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH WELL WE ALSO HAVE TO DETERMINE IN SOME MANNER HOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN MODES BETWEEN GOING THROUGH YOUR FAVOURITES LIST AND JUST HITTING UP ONE UP TWO
NO BECAUSE YOU WANNA BE ABLE TO GO UP AND DOWN THROUGH THE CHANNELS
RIGHT
I THINK WE'LL NEED A WE'LL NEED A MODE SWITCH BUT THEN IF WE HAVE A MODE SWITCH WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME KINDA INDICATOR
TO WHICH AN L. E. AN L. E. D. OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
JUST SO YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BEFORE WE WERE GONNA STAY IN THE MID MARKET RANGE
IT SEEMS WE'RE KIND OF APPROACHING A HIGHER END RANGE
I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S OKAY WITH THAT
OKAY
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD WITH IT
SO
RIGHT
WELL Y YEAH
LET'S LET'S TRY AND THINK NOW HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR WITH ALL THESE FEATURES HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY IF YOU WENT TO THE STORE
AND YOU WERE IN THE MARKET F TO REPLACE YOUR T. V. REMOTE HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR THAT
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
IF
THEN YOU COULD PROBABLY AFFORD THIS
OH NO NO
I WOULD SAY THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY
OKAY
RIGHT
WITH A CRADLE RADIO TRANSMITTERS
AND BACK LIT BUTTONS
AND IT'S GONNA LOOK SEXY
OR NOT
IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE CLAY
PROBABLY
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE DONE IF WE CAN GO EARLIER
YEAH
I DON'T THINK SO
IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE'LL JUST EMAIL YOU I GUESS
THINK S
MM
PRO
PROBABLY NOT 'CAUSE HE'S
'S BEEN LISTENING TO TOO MUCH
HE'S GETTING RETARDED
YAY
OR NOT
YEAH
APPARENTLY I'M OLD AS WELL
PRESENTED BY NAME
MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA
YOU KILLED MY FATHER
PREPARE TO DIE
YEAH THERE'S A THINGY AND A DINGY AND
NAH
I WANNA CHANGE THAT
I LIKE THE KINETIC
OH INTERFACE CONCEPT
VERY LONG PRESENTATION
WELL THAT DOESN'T BO BODE WELL FOR IT FOR IT TATS AS WELL
UM SO SOMEHOW THAT THING'S TOO BIG BUT UM OKAY UM OUR UH MANUFACTURING DIVISION WANTED THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
THEY SAY THEY COULD PUT IT TO WORK BUT UM WE DON'T THINK SO
NO
IT IT IT YOU'LL BE YOU KNOW BE AFFECTED BY THE BY THE OTHER SPEECH AND
YEAH AND AND FIGHTING FOR THE REMOTE WOULD NOT BE FUN ANYMORE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANNA KEEP
THAT KINDA WOULD R D YEAH
THAT WOULD KIND OF LOSE IT
YEAH SO UM TAKING THAT AWAY
OUR UH THE THE THE RUBBER BUT RUBBER BUTTONS ARE THE MORE RELIABLE IT'S THE THE ONES THAT WOULD AL WOULD ALLOW US TO TO MARKET OUR PRODUCT AS BEING YOU KNOW LESS PRONE TO DAMAGE AND MORE RESISTANT TO THINGS LIKE SPILLAGE OF LIQUIDS OVER IT OR YOU KNOW MISTREAT MISUSES
AS IT HAPPENS TO REMOTE CONTROLS
UM AS FOR THE
POINT THAT WE MAKING ABOUT LOSING IT
WELL WE WANNA SMALL R REMOTE CONTROL ONE SIDE BECAUSE UH WE WANT IT TO BE COOL AND UH DESIGNED
BUT UM APPARENTLY UM MARKET SHOWS THAT BIGGER S BIGGER UM REMOTES GET LESS LOST ABOUT
BUT UM YEAH I THINK WE WE NEED TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THOSE TWO AND SOMEHOW WE'LL DO THAT
SOMEHOW
UM SO THE THE WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE IS SOMETHING MORE OR LESS IN THE UH DIRECTION OF WHAT IS TO YO THE RIGHT OF THAT SLIDE UH BUT WITHOUT WITH A L A LESS COMPLICATED UM DESIGN
SO THE NUMBERS THE VOLUME CONTROL AND CHANNEL CONTROL AND TELETEXT ACCESS
UH THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL CAN JUST BECOME THOSE THE THE FOUR BUTTON ARRAY AS IN IF IT WAS A ROUND DIAL
AND UM IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT AS THE ONE TO THE RIGHT BUT WITH THE NUMBERS AND THE FOUR BUTTONS PLUS MAYBE A CENTRE ONE WITH TELETEXT
YE NO IT'S NOT I I IT'S JUST FOUR BUTTONS THAT ARE ON A CROSS
SO THAT YOU BA BASICALLY CAN CONTROL ALL OF THE IMPORTANT TASKS FROM THAT ALONE
YEAH UM YEAH SO I THINK WE W WE GO FOR SOMETHING MID SIZED SO SOMETHING LOOKS GOOD AND UH IS NOT TOO PRONE TO GET LOST
THAT BE IT
BUT WOULD WE
I DUNNO
I'LL BET FIRST IN VOLUME MAYBE
I DUNNO
IT'S ONLY A T. V.
HMM
MM-HMM
NO IT'S JUST DIFFERENT
MAYBE NOT
S
YEAH
YEAH I THINK WE HAVE LIKE AND IT'S NOT VERY USABLE AND IT WILL BRING DOWN THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE WHOLE THING 'CAUSE IT'S IT IT BREAKS DOWN EASIER
MM-HMM
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY SO WE'LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND FIFTY THAT IS RUG RUBBER ROBUST WITH SCROLL WHEEL
WITH THE NEW FACILITIES OF THE SCROLL WHEEL LIKE FAVOURITE STUFF FAVOURITE CHANNELS AND AND WITH A CRADLE AND YEAH AND THE LOCATOR
OR NOT
OKAY SO YOU CAN MARKET PE DEPENDING ON THAT
COOL
HMM
YEAH I THINK IT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING'S COVERED
COULDA BEEN WORSE
YES I AM
ROCK AND ROLL
SO DO WE NEED TO RE TRAIN MIKE ON HOW TO PUT HIS MIC ON
OKAY CAN HE GET IT ALL BY HIMSELF THIS TIME
SO
I BELIEVE I CAN FLY
JUST WHAT I NEEDED WAS SOMETHING EXCITING
REMEMBER I'M AN OLD MAN
THIRTY'S REALLY YOUNG EH
JOSE HE MAN IS
N NAME
I'VE
I JUST LOVE YOU TECH GUYS HUH
THEY JUST
YEAH Y DO JABBER
P
YEAH
I I GOTTA I GOTTA FLASHLIGHT AND UH YEAH BUT IT'S INTERESTING 'CAUSE YOU SHAKE IT LIKE THIS
LIKE THIS
AND THAT'S ON THE CAMERA
YEAH
I G I I FIGURED YOU WOULD
YES
YEAH
IT IT IT
UH
UH UH TO ME IN A MARKETING SENSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT RELATIVE
WE CAN WE CAN O WE CAN UH ACCENTUATE WHATEVER WHATEVER PRODUCT YOU PUT IN THERE WE CAN FIND A WAY TO ACCENTUATE IT
AND IF YOU MAKE IT FROM THAT SUPER RUBBER WHEN YOU DROP IT ON THE FLOOR IT CAN BOUNCE RIGHT BACK UP IN YOUR HAND
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO LEAN DOWN TO GET IT
MM-HMM YEAH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SEE
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SEE ALSO
OOH
THAT'S RIGHT
MM-HMM
I DUNNO
TREND WATCHING I GUESS
TREND WATCHING I BELIEVE
SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WHEN I S WHEN I SEE THE WHEN I SEE THE PRODUCT I I I I DON'T WANNA BUY IT
I SEE SO MANY OF 'EM OUT THERE
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THAT PRODUCT THAT MAKES ME WANNA CHOOSE THAT PRODUCT OVER OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY 'CAUSE 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HOW TO MARKET THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT TO MARKET YET
AND UH FROM FROM TALKING TO MIKE IS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE UH WE CAN MARKET A MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCT NOW
THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND SO HELLO
AND AND SO YEAH I'M A I'M A LITTLE BIT STUCK RIGHT NOW IN THAT WHAT UH W WHAT IS IT THAT I'M GONNA MARKET
UH WITHOUT SPECIAL OR INCREASED MARKETABLE FEATURES I DON'T BELIEVE THE PRODUCT HAS A CONSUMER DEMAND
UH I LIKE THE IDEA OF OF THE SCROLL MAKIN THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE MAKING THESE PRODUCTS AT THIS PRICE RIGHT NOW
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO MAKE THIS ONE SPECIAL AND UNIQUE
UH WELL I DON'T YEAH IT'S I I JUST SEE IT AS DIFFERENT
I DON'T SAY IT'S SPECIALLY MM
I DON'T SAY IT'S SPECIAL
UH I SAY THAT IT'S DIFFERENT I WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR AS MARKETING IS M GIVE ME SOMETHING DIFFERENT
I GIVE ME A LOWER PRICE GIVE ME A HIGHER PRICE GIVE ME SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY
DON'T GIVE ME THE SAME THING THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS PUTTING OUT THERE ON THE SHELF IT'S F AT THE SAME PRICE
I NEED SOMETHING TO MARKET ABOUT THIS THING
WE'RE WE'RE A NEW FIRM
WHAT I IF WHEN WHEN WE HAVE YEAH WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THE CRADLE OR OR SOMETHING GIVE THAT'S AS AS A MARKETING STANDARD I NEED SOMETHING TO MARKET
TO MAKE THIS PRODUCT UNIQUE
YEP
MM 'KAY
JUST REMEMBER WHEN I MADE UP THIS REPORT I DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE
AND AND SO SO UH YEAH WHEN WE HAVE A CRADLE WHEN WE HAVE SOME KIND OF DESIGN
SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT TO MARKET RIGHT NOW
UM UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS THAT WE MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENT IN THE COST EITHER LOWER OR DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED NEW TECHNOL TECHNOLOGY
THAT'S THAT IS THE NEXT STEP THERE'S TECHNOLOGY AND THEN THERE IS TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE'RE MOVING INTO THE NEXT PHASE
AND SO UH WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE THE MARKETABILITY
YEAH UH AGAIN I'M NOT SOLD ON THE PRODUCT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT IN MY OPINION YET
SO I NEED A PRODUCT
I NEED A PRODUCT TO MARKET
AND I JUST WHATEVER PRODUCT YOU GUYS PUT TOGETHER WE'LL FIND A WAY TO MARKET IT
THA THAT I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH
IF YOU IF YOU GIVE ME IF YOU GIVE ME A CUT OUT OF WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS THEN I NEED TO I NEED TO FIND A LOWER COST
YEAH WH WH WHAT'S THE WH
OKAY NOW WHAT I SEE WITH THE SCROLL WHEEL IS EVERYBODY HAS BUTTONS
SO FROM A MARKETING STANDPOINT I HAVE I HAVE ANOTHER DOOR TO WALK THROUGH WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S UNIQUE
IF IT CREATES SOMETHING MORE COMPLEX OR MORE EXPENSIVE THEN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES IT UH A MARKETING NECESSITY
BUT AGAIN FROM A MARKETING PERSPECTIVE I WANT AS MUCH NEW AND DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS THING AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE CO IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
I THINK IT'S THAT'S RIGHT
I THINK SO
MM
YEP
I THINK WE GOT SOME EXCLUSIVITY IN THAT YOU KNOW WE GOT SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS RIGHT NOW
AND AND THAT MEANS WE CAN WE CAN MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE RETAIL OR WHOLESALE PRICE IF WE NEED TO AND IT ALSO CAN CREATE IT'S OWN DEMAND FROM IT'S UNIQUENESS
YEAH
YEAH RIGHT NOW THERE'S RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOTHING COMING OUT OF THE T. V. TO RECEIVE
SO YOU KNOW UNLESS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND INFORMATION STARTS COMING OUT OF THE A CABLE BOX OR SOMETHING THERE'S NO S I DON'T SEE THE
I DON'T SEE THE NECESSITY OF AN L. C. D. EITHER
DON'T SEE IT
AGAIN
WELL I THINK IT'S IT'S THE MORE UNIQUENESS YOU CAN BRING TO THE PRODUCT THE EASIER IT IS I BELIEVE FOR ME TO MARKET
UH AGAIN THE PUSH BUTTONS I I SEE ARE ARE EVERYWHERE
AND SO WE CAN GO WITH THE SAME THING BUT WE'RE GONNA BE COM COMPETING IN A IN A BROADER MARKET THAN IF WE GO WITH SOMETHING UNIQUE
YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS YOU KNOW DO WE GO TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
MAKE A REMOTE THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A REMOTE
IT'S JUST ANOTHER IT'S JUST A AN IDEA AND I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN WHAT I SEE ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU BROUGHT UP IN AN EARLIER PRESENTATION IS
WHEN YOU GOT CHILDREN THEIR THEIR STUFF GETS INSIDE THE CIRCUITRY THEY GET DIRTY THEY GET MESSY WITH DRINKS AND STUFF
THIS
AND WHAT I KEEP THROWING OUT THERE I JUST KEEP THROWING OUT IDEAS TO TRY TO MAKE THIS THING LOOK OR ACT OR IN SOME WAY IDENTIFY ITSELF AS UNIQUE OR DIFFERENT
BUT YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO C ULTIMATELY CREATE THE PRODUCT WITHIN COST
OH OKAY PHEW
I THINK YOU GOTTA G GET INTO COST EFFECTIVENESS
I THINK IF YOU CAN HAVE THE BASE STATION WITH A WITH A LOCATOR
I THINK THOSE ARE TWO VERY STRONG FEATURES IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED WITHOUT A BUNCH OF EXTRA COST
MM-HMM
INTEGRATED YEAH
SO IT'S JUST UH I I THINK THAT'S
I KNOW PERSONALLY THAT WOULD BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE FEATURE IS TO HAVE A UH HAVE A BUTTON I CAN PUSH TO FIND MY REMOTE CONTROL
OR MAYBE YOU CAN LIKE HAVE A A SMELL O RAMA YOU KNOW YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND IT S PUTS OUT A STINK
YOU CAN
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
W
YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH
I I THINK THERE'S YOU KNOW THAT UH THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE TODAY THAT ARE THAT ARE SURFING ARE TELEVISION SURFERS
AND I SEE THE SCROLL AS A AS A GREAT MECHANISM FOR SURFING
INSTEAD OF GOING BUTTON TO BU YOU JUST J YOU'D J J J J J J
I REALLY I REALLY THINK THAT'S A REALLY COOL THING FOR SURFING
WELL THERE'S ANO
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH I THINK SO
I I THINK SO
NOW THE THE ONLY THING I I ON THE INTERFACE SIDE OF IT IS THAT I I I SEE THE DILEMMA
BUT IF WE HAVE THE OPTION OF OF SCROLLING AT ANY PARTICULAR SPEED OR THE OPTION OF JUMPING DIRECT OKAY
SO I CAN GO UH PRESUMING I HAVE ON MY TELEVISION
SOMETHING THAT TELLS ME WHAT CHANNEL I'M ON I CAN SCROLL DIRECT FROM CHANNEL FIVE TO CHANNEL THIRTY TWO
I KNOW WHAT BECAUSE IT'S ON THE TELEVISION
THE TELEVISION TELLS ME WHAT CHANNEL IT'S ON WHEN I CHANGE IT
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT REALLY THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE A A D PROBLEM
'CAUSE THE TELEVISION CAN GO AUTOMATICALLY FROM CHANNEL FIVE TO CHANNEL THIRTY TWO WITH THE PUSH OF A BUTTON
OKAY
SO CA CAN WE CAN WE CREATE THAT KIND OF INTERFACE WITHIN A SCROLL SYSTEM
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING
OH NO WE COULD READ IT FROM THE TELEVISION
YEAH THE THE TELEVISION CAN TELL YOU
CAN
PUT
AND THEN
AND AGAIN WE HAVE ANOTHER ANOTHER GREAT MARKETING TOOL
WE HAVE ABOUT THREE WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR THINGS HERE
I DUNNO AND AN MAYBE WE MAYBE EVEN HAVE THIS AS IN HOUSE TECHNOLOGY
THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT'S AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR OWN UH THROUGH OUR OWN SERVICES
OR WE GO DIRECTIONAL UP WE GO WE GO THIS WE GO THIS WE GO THIS WAY FOR ONE WE GO THIS WAY FOR THE OTHER
AH HA OKAY
OKAY OKAY WELL THEN YOU JUST HAVE YOU HAVE A DIFF YOU HAVE A MODE SWITCH
YEAH YEAH
WELL YOU HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAVE MORE MONEY FOR THIS
DIDN'T YOU SAY SO
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
WE CAN INCREASE THE COST
SO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HAVING
WELL I THINK TH I THINK THE DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY HAS TO COME BACK AND SAY
OKAY TO CREATE THIS PRODUCT WE SEE IT'S GONNA COST US THIS MUCH FOR THIS VOLUME
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A VOLUME TARGET OF OF FIFTY MILLION PROFIT
OKAY I'M I'M OKAY WITH THAT
I GUESS WHAT I JUST WANT TO ME THE NEXT STEP IS FOR THESE GUYS TO COME COME IN WITH THE DESIGN PROPOSAL W WITH THE COST ESTIMATE ATTACHED
AND THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL
WE HAVE TO FIND COST
YEAH I WAS GONNA SAY THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY
BECAUSE ONE OF TH ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE MARKETING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS THAT THIS IS THE LAST ONE YOU WILL EVER NEED TO BUY FOR YOUR TELEVISION
IT'S ONE OF THE MARKETING FEATURES IN THIS
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
BAS TH THAT'S THAT'S EASY
THAT'S THAT'S NOT A IT'S A
'CAUSE WE HAVE ABOUT SIX SIX SEVEN FEATURES IN THAT ALONE
UNDER THE TITLE OF UNIQUENESSES
WELL I HAVE
IS MY THREE TWENTY ONE IS THE NEXT MEETING
THAT'S THAT'S ALMOST UH FIFTY MINUTES
YOU GUYS CAN
YOU GUYS YOU GUYS CAN UH CREATE A
ALL KINDS OF THINGS
THANKS YEAH
STILL
THANK YOU
I DON'T HAVE ANY EMAILS
THIS MEANS I CAN GO HOME
OH WE ALL LEAVE
UH 'KAY
SO
YEP
OKAY SO WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILED DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT 'KAY
AND HERE'S THE AGENDA FOR THIS MEETING
UH I'M JUST GONNA OPEN SAY A FEW BORING WORDS TO START WITH AGAIN AND START TAKING MINUTES AFTERWARDS
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA GIVE US A PRESENTATION OF OUR WONDER PRODUCT THAT I CAN SEE SOME DEMONSTRATIONS OF OVER THERE
LOOKS COOL
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA EVALUATE IT
THEN WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT FINANCE AND I'VE GOT A LOVELY EXCEL SPREADSHEET THAT I KNOCKED UP IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES FOR THIS
AND UH YEP
AND WE'RE GONNA EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AND CLOSE
GOT FORTY MINUTES TO DO THIS IN
WE SHOULD BE FINE
LET'S TRY AND KEEP THIS ONE ON SCHEDULE
SO
YOUR
THING IS IN WHERE IS IT
IS IT IN
WHO WANTS IT
ZAPPING YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS EH
OH OKAY OKAY
AH 'KAY OKAY THAT'S FAVOURITES
AH 'KAY
I LIKE THE THE THE THE LOGO ON THERE AS WELL
IT IS VERY PROMINENT
SO THIS IS THE
OKAY
AH OKAY I SEE
IT'S PRETTY COOL
IS THAT COULD THAT BE EASY TO FOR THE SCROLL WHEEL TO BE ROTATED IF IT LANDS ON IT
OH WELL I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON THE STIFFNESS A LITTLE OF IT
MM
FEELS GOOD
I TAKE IT THAT THIS IS GONNA BE SLIGHTLY LIGHTER IN THE FINAL DESIGN AS WELL
YEAH IT'S KINDA COOL
YOU HAVE TO REACH A LITTLE BIT DON'T YOU
AH YEAH THAT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE
IT'S COOL
I'M IMPRESSED
AND HOLD IT SO WH WHAT'S THE MARKETING PERSPECTIVE
OKAY
MM IT'S IMPRESSING
SO LET ME GET IT IF I PRESS THIS BUTTON
I SEE
THAT'S PRETTY COOL
HANG ON
I PLAN TO DO THAT AS WELL
SO THE THE TWO BLUE ARE ARE THOSE FOR THE THE IT TO CHARGE OFF OF IN
AH OKAY OKAY
YEAH IT'S THE RIGHT SHAPE ISN'T IT
BUT MAYBE IF YOU HAD A TRIGGER PLUS THE SCROLL THEN THAT WOULD GET PAST THE THE PROBLEM OF IT LANDING AND SCROLLING
'CAUSE THEN IT WOULD NEED TO BE HIT ON BOTH SIDES
OKAY
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY GOT OPTIONS FOR LIKE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODELS AND THINGS AS WELL BASED ON THAT HASN'T IT
SO IS THAT THE THE FINAL COLOUR SCHEME AS WELL OR
OKAY
THE HMM
IT CAME OFF
THE SCROLL WHEELS A PROBLEM WITH THEM NOT BEING SORT OF
I DON'T THINK THE USER INTERFACE GUY WANTS TO TOUCH IT ANYMORE
MM
OKAY ENOUGH OF THAT
WELL I IT'S COOL GUYS
'KAY SO ARE WE DONE WITH THE THIS PRESENTATION
OKAY
NOW NOW
HAVE YOU
OKAY
CAN I NOT GET YOUR GET AT STUFF FROM YOUR SHARED FOLDER NOW
OH I SEE I SEE
DO YOU WOULD YOU A ARGUE THAT THAT WE'RE BETTER GOING FOR THE HIGHER COST THAN BRINGING IT DOWN INTO TWENTY F FIVE AS WE PROBABLY COULD
BUT LOWERING OUR PROFIT MARGINS
MM-HMM
MM 'KAY
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE OPEN TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE PRODUCT FOR A LATER VERSION WITH THOSE FEATURES QUITE SIMPLY ANYWAY AREN'T WE
TH THERE'S NO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT
HMM
YEAH THE PLUS THERE'S THE THE RISK OF MAKING IT UNUSABLE AS WELL
OR MAKING IT LESS B BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO LOOK AT ALL THE BUTTONS
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO IT'S VERY SIMPLE AND IT JUST WORKS
MM THERE'S A RISK OF THAT
OKAY SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT FINANCE NOW
SO I HAVE A LITTLE SPREADSHEET FOR US WHERE I I WAS WONDERING
YOU WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT EUROS I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THAT FIGURE
OKAY SO I HAVE BIT OF A SPREADSHEET HERE FOR THIS
NOW
I'VE MADE A F FEW ASSUMPTIONS HERE IN THAT I'M ASSUMING THAT OUR POWER ADAPTOR WE CAN MAKE FOR A COST OF FOUR EUROS
EQUIVALENT TO SOLAR CELLS WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY FAIR CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE IN HOUSE MANUFACTURING OF POWER ADAPTORS ALREADY
UH AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THE LOCATOR BEACON THE YOU KNOW THE
CAN BE MADE FOR IT SOUNDED DIFFERENT THAT TIME UH CAN BE MADE FOR A SIMILAR PRICE TO UH AN L. C. DISPLAY UH AN UH
UH DO YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR COMING FROM A M THE MANUFACTURING
OKAY
YEP
OKAY
SO WE'RE DOWN TO SIXTEEN POINT FOUR YEAH
IS THAT A SINGLE CURVED RATHER THAN A DOUBLE CURVED
WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT SINGLE CURVE VERSUS DOUBLE CUR
YOU THINK
OKAY I'M CONVINCED
BUT WE SAVE ONE EURO THAT WAY YEAH
SO WE COME BRING IT DOWN TO
FIFTEEN POINT FOUR
WELL HANG ON
DO DON'T SPEAK SO IT'S IN HERE IN THAT W DO WE HAVE ANY WE HAVE SPECIAL FORM DON'T WE
SO THAT'S YEAH
BUT THE THE THE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT ANY SPECIAL COLOUR THOUGH UH I DON'T TH IF WE'RE GOING FOR GREYS AND SILVERS THEN I DON'T THINK WE'RE
O OKAY SO WE'RE
PUSH BUTTON SCROLL WHEEL WE'RE BASICALLY WE HAVE UH TH IS THIS INTENDED TO BE A BUTTON AS WELL OR JUST A SCROLL
JUST A SCROLL
IT'S NOT ONE OF THE SCROLLS WHERE FOR EXAMPLE WITH THIS ONE YOU COULD PUSH IT DOWN TO BE A BUTTON
OKAY THEN WE HAVE FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT EUROS
IT WASN'T BAD
OKAY SO
WE'RE ON TO THE
WE'RE ON TO THE PAT ON THE BACK PART OF THE
PRESENTATION WHERE WE HAVE A LOOK AT THE CRITERIAS TH THAT PAUL THE CRITERION CRITERIA THAT PAUL HAS HAS GIVEN US AND WE CAN USE THAT TO TELL
HOW'S IT GOING
ANYONE GOT ANY THOUGHTS
HOW HOW HAVE WE DONE TODAY
I THINK WE DID PRETTY WELL TOO
THAT LOOKS PRETTY SPECTACULAR
ANY OTHER CHANG UH THOUGHTS
OKAY SO TH TH WHAT ABOUT UM ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
IS IT THE
I I THINK WE WE ENDED UP BEING QUITE CREATIVE THERE
MM
NOT EVERY IDEA NECESSARILY IT'S STILL A REMOTE CONTROL
UH NO YEAH BUT WE DID WE DID BREAK WITH THE SPECS A LITTLE BIT I GUESS BUT THE UH
'KAY LEADERSHIP WHAT DO WE REPORT BACK TO THE BOSSES
NO TH TH I THINK THEY WERE R REASONABLY FLEXIBLE WITH US OVER THE WHOLE CHANGING THE SPECS THING
I AGREE
SYNERGY
TEAMWORK YEAH HE IS UH
WHAT DID WE THINK OF THE MEETING ROOM I GUESS IS AN IMPORTANT THING HERE
MM
YEAH THIS FALLS OFF AND UH THE WHITE BOARD WORKED REALLY WELL WITHOUT ANY PRO
MM MM LAPEL
WHA OKAY OH ALRIGHT
THAT'S IT'S DOWN IT'S QUITE CLOSE
KEEP IT KEEP IT CALM
OH DEAR
NO MORE PIZZA FOR ME
SO YEAH THE THE PEN CAME IN ALRIGHT AND IT'S A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE TO USE BUT I GUESS IT WORKS
NAH I'M I'M NOT CONVINCED OF THAT AT ALL
I'VE BEEN WOR I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THAT ALL DAY BUT SEE THESE LOOK LIKE THEY'RE THAT LOOKS THE OTH THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE THAT WAY AROUND
BUT IT FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE WH WHAT YOU CALL UPSIDE DOWN
I DON'T CARE
UH OKAY SO THAT DATA MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY INVALID
WHAT NEW IDEAS HAVE WE FOUND
WELL LET'S DO BOTH THEN
UH FOR THE PRODUCT
YEAH WE CAME UP WITH QUITE A BIT
AND FOR THE MEETING ROOM HAS ANYONE GOT ANY MORE
YEAH LESS SORE ON THE EARS
OKAY SO
ARE THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET
NOPE
OH HANG ON IT REALLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE THAT THE COSTS WERE UNDER TWELVE FIFTY EUROS
NO REQUIREMENTS ARE CHANGED
WE'RE STILL UNDER TWENTY EUROS TO BUILD SO WE'RE GOOD
AND THE COSTS WITHIN THE BUDGET
NOT THE ORIGINAL BUDGET BUT THEY ARE NOW
IS THE PROJECT EVALUATED
MM I THINK SO YEAH THEN CELEBRATION AS IT SAYS
OH I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GOT THERE
UH ANYWAY
THANK
THANKS GUYS
YEAH I'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERWORK TO CATCH UP ON TOO
OH
PUT ON YOUR MIC
BOSS
YEP
ALRIGHT
THREE THREE
PEDRO CAN HAVE IT
I LIKE I'LL HELP TALK
UNIT PRICE
SCROLLING THROUGH YOUR FAVOURITES LIST
IT'S VERY PROMINENT
SO HERE I'LL GIVE YOU THE SO THIS IS THE CRADLE UNIT AND THIS IS THE ACTUAL REMOTE ITSELF
UM SO THE SCROLL BAR IS OR THE SCROLL WHEEL IS THIS THIS GREEN LITTLE SCROLLY GUY HERE UM AND THEN THE VOLUME CONTROLS ARE HERE AND HERE
UH YOU'VE GOT THE KEYPAD WHICH IS THE NUMBERS UH F FROM ZERO TO NINE AND THEN TEN
THIS IS THE POWER BUTTON
UH WE HAVE OUR UM WE HAVE THE ENTER BUTTON AND UH WHAT WAS THE OTHER BUTTON HERE
THIS IS THE TELETEXT
THE PROGRAMME BUTTON YEAH THE PROGRAMME BUTTON
SO THIS BL THIS BUTTON WILL BE USED BOTH FOR THE FAVOURITES AND FOR PROGRAMMING YOUR UH THE UM THE TYPE OF TELEVISION YOU WANNA USE
SO UM THE PLASTIC IS THE WHITE AREA OF THIS OF THE MODEL HERE AND THE RED AREA IS LIKE A RUBBER COVERING
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT WHEN IT LAYS LIKE THIS OR LIKE THIS AND THE BUTTONS ARE ALL GONNA BE RUBBER
SO IT'S PRETTY HARD TO ACTUALLY DAMAGE IT UM
YEAH THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE
A MI UH POSSIBLE PROBLEM BUT IF YOU DROP IT YEAH
YEAH AND IT DEPENDS ON IF IT'S SLIDING BUT I THINK IT'S PRETTY ERGONOMIC
YOU CAN FEEL IT
YEAH OF COURSE
WELL THIS IS CLAY
YEAH THE THE POWER BUTTON IS A BIT OF A REACH BUT I THINK WE MIGHT SCALE DOWN THE FINAL MODEL A BIT
THESE THIS IS A BIT LARGER THAN IT WOULD BE BUT
MM PEDRO CAN DEMONSTRATE THE THE PAGING ABILITY
BEEP BEEP BEEP
UM BEEP BEEP BEEP SO BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BE SHUT UP
BEEP BEEP BEEP OKAY
UM NO NO NO THA THAT'S ALRI
EXACTLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THOSE ARE FOR
AND UM THERE'S ONE OTHER FEATURE THAT WE WERE DEBATING BUT WE DECIDED TO GO AGAINST IT
IS UM YOU COULD BEEP BEEP BEEP WE WERE THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO HAVE A TRIGGER BUTTON HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS FINGER IT IT'S IT KINDA FEELS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING THERE
BUT WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT BUTTON IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO PUT THERE
AND WE WE DON'T WANNA ACCIDENTALLY BE HITTING THE POWER BUTTON LIKE THAT SO
MM
RIGHT
SO MAYBE IN A FINAL DESIGN PHASE WE MIGHT TWEAK THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT
MM-HMM
OH NO THIS IS JUST WHAT WE HAD TO WORK WITH AT THE TIME
SO WE'LL LEAVE THE COLOUR SCHEME UP TO THE MARKETING PEOPLE
CAREFUL
BEEP BEEP BEEP
YEAH
NO WAY
BEEP BEEP BEEP
MM-HMM
WELL THAT WAS JUST JUST OUR TECHNICAL TEAM ADDED UP THE UM PRODUCTION COSTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL UNITS
OH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
YEAH
OH SORRY
YEAH UM I DO THINK WE THAT WE WE UH DON'T NEED THE EVENTS CHIP ON PRINT
WE ONLY NEED THE UH THE REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT SO THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A M MISCALCULATION IN THERE
AND WE AND WE HAVE A SINGLE CURVED UH
UH I THINK THAT
IT'S SINGLE CURVED YEAH
SEE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN F SINGLE CURVED
SO YEAH IT'S FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE CAME UP WITH IT
OKAY
YEAH WE DO
AH
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
OH IT'S A THAT'S NOT VERY SPECIAL IT'S PRETTY
IF TH
THAT'S A SCROLL
UH NO WE JUST USE IT AS A SCROLL
IT WAS A PRETTY ACCURATE ESTIMATE I WOULD SAY
YEAH
S 'S KIND OF S FRIGHTENINGLY ACCURATE
WHAT
I THINK WE DID PRETTY WELL
SH I THINK THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM
WE GOT A COUPLE INNOVATIVE I
COUPLE INNOVATIVE IDEAS
MM-HMM
YEP
THERE WAS A LOT OF SYNERGY
THESE CABLES SUCK
YEP
YEAH
LAPEL
THAT'S OUR BOSS
PEDRO'S RIGHT
PEDRO'S RIGHT
OH WEL
WELL WE HAD THE FAVOURITES LIST AND THE SCROLL BAR AND WE HAVE THE CRADLE

GOOD JOB GUYS
SO YOU FORGOT HOW THIS WORKS AGAIN
BOSS
HMM YOU KNOCKED IT UP
THI THIRD THIRD THIRD
THE END PRODUCT THINGY
YEAH
UM YEAH SO WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH
PRODUCTION COSTS ESTIMATED BY OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT AND UM THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT WHICH IS US IS UH FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT EUROS
SOMEONE FORGOT THE UNITS THERE YEAH UH UNIT PRICE UNIT PRODUCTION PRICE COST THING
UM
WE IMPLEMENTED THE BASIC FUNCTIONS WHICH IS JUST T. V. FUNCTIONS PLUS THE LOCATOR WHICH WAS ONE OF THE MARKETING THINGS CRADLE
SCROLL WHEEL FOR UH THE THE CHANNELS
AND UH WE IMPLEMENTED THE F THE THE WAY OF PUTTING THE NEW AND REVOLUTIONARY ZAPPING YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNELS FUNCTIONALITY IN THE SCROLL
YEAH
ZAPPING YOU KNOW ZAPPING
MAYBE IT'S JUST A PORTUGUESE THING
AND UM YEAH THAT WAS THE RESULT
START S THE THE START UH TO TO TO PROGRAMME YEAH
NOT HELPING
DON'T HAVE NO ONE TO HANDLE THAT
YEAH
SO YOU HA YOU HAVE LIKE THE THE BASE STATION WITH UM THE LITTLE BUTTON FOR THE WHERE'S MY REMOTE
THE LOCATOR FUNCTION
WICKED ISN'T IT
JA
NAH
IT FELL OFF
W WE NEED WE NEED WE NEED S SOME MORE BUTTONS IF IT WOULD TO WORK ON SOME OTHER STUFF BUT
WE WE W YEAH WE COULD GET ANOTHER VERSION OF IT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS
BUT UH
VERY CO VERY COLF COLOURFUL
BEEP BEEP BEEP
YEAH
WE DON'T
IT'S A SCROLL

MM
COULDA BEEN WORSE
MM N NO
HOORAY
FREE COKE PROVIDED AT THE CAFETERIA
WHO WROTE THAT ONE
COOL
SO SO SO
MAYBE
MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE
BRA
MM THAT'S OH THAT'S OH I LIKE IT
I MEAN YOU GUYS GAVE ME MORE THAN I WAS ASKING FOR SO I'M HAPPY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY MARKETABLE FEATURES IN THIS
YEAH I THINK IT'S GOOD
GOOD GOOD GOOD JOB
UH PLA
I'M HA
IT'S GREAT
THAT'S GREAT
IT'S A GREAT FEATURE
SO YOU CAN TAKE THIS HO TAKE THIS HOME WITH YOU TONIGHT AND YOU CAN PUSH THAT AND HE'LL BE ACROSS TOWN
UH I CAN SEE THAT
YEP I LIKE
GOOD JOB
NO NO
WELL I MEAN OF COURSE I MEAN
MY MY S MY SUGGESTION IS WE'RE GONNA GO GO TO THE SILVERS AND BLACKS LIKE MOST OF THE TELEVISIONS
YOU KNOW SOME BLEND OF SILVERS AND BLACKS
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND MY UH MY FOLDER UP THERE I GOTTA DO MINE UP AT THE BOARD
YEAH YEAH
SO
NO IT'S NOT IN THERE BECAUSE I HAD THE COMPUTER PROBLEM AND I I I COU I COULDN'T CREATE IT
I COULDN'T CREATE IT IN THE POWERPOINT AND I THINK I'VE GOT THIS REALLY STRANGE CABLE
SO WHAT I HAD BASICALLY GOING FROM THE POWERPOINT FORMAT IS THAT UH YEAH YEAH I LIKE THIS A LOT
IS THIS ONE OF THE TESTS IS TO SEE HOW WE CAN ADAPT TO S CHANGING SITUATIONS IN THE IN THE MEETING ROOM
SO WHAT WE HAD IS WE HAD THE METHOD
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU SPELL METHOD IS IT
NO A.
SO THIS DOESN'T GO SO FAST THIS WAY
AND WHEN I SPEAK ABOUT METHOD I SPEAK ABOUT THE MARKETING OF THE PRODUCT HUH
AND UH TO ME WITH THIS PRODUCT WE GOT UH WE GOT BASICALLY THREE THINGS TO MARKET
WE'VE GOT THE FEATURES
WE HAVE THE UH CHARACTERISTICS
AND WE HAVE THE I I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE OTHER PART WHAT WE CALL YOU KNOW THE THE THE
CORP CORPORATE
HELP ME
THE THE CORPORATION STANDS BEHIND THE PRODUCT OKAY
SO THE FEATURES I THINK WE GOT THE SCROLL WE'VE GOT THE UH THE LOCATOR WE'VE GOT THE DURABILITY
WE'VE GOT THE DEPENDABILITY WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW THE FEATURES THAT MAKE THIS A UNIQUE PRODUCT
UM
THE CHARACTERISTICS I TALK ABOUT WE HAVE RELIABILITY WE HAVE COMFORT WE HAVE ERGONOMICS WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTALLY S SENSITIVE
UH AND THE CORPORATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE WE'RE A NEW WE'RE A NEW COMPANY
WE'RE WANTING TO MAKE A NAME FOR OURSELF
WE'RE WANTING YOU TO UH FIND OUR PRODUCT SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU A GOOD PRODUCT AT A FAIR PRICE
ONE THING I WOULD WANT TO TO SEE IS UH IS CAN WE CAN WE GET A LIFETIME UH GUARANTEE ON THIS PRODUCT
A NORMAL USE GUARANTEE WHICH MEANS THAT THIS PRODUCT FOR THE FOR THE LIFE OF OF THE LIFE USE
IF IT SHOULD HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM THAT WE COULD RE REPLACE IT AT NO COST
THAT WAS SOMETHING I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN
UM SO YEAH WITHOUT UH GOING INTO GREAT DETAILS WE HAVE A WE HAVE A PRODUCT IT HAS THE FEATURES AND THE CHARACTERISTICS AND THE BACKGROUND
I BELIEVE TO MAKE IT MARKETABLE I BELIEVE AT A COST OF OF OF THIRTY THIRTY FIVE TO TO FIFTY EUROS
WE'RE GONNA BE COMPETITIVE AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MARKET NICHE
UM W
THAT THAT WOULD BE UH THAT WOULD BE I THINK A DECISION BEST MADE BY CORPORATE UM I I M FOR MY EVALUATION BASED ON WHAT OUR COMPETITION IS
I TH I THINK THAT THAT WE CAN GO AFTER THIS AND AND AND GO AFTER MORE OF THE UH EXCLUSIVITY SENSE THAN THE MASS MARKET SENSE
BUT I'M SH I'M SURE OPEN TO TO MARKET THIS IN EITHER DIRECTION
BUT YOU GUYS CAME UP WITH A GREAT PRODUCT AND AT THAT COST I THINK IT UH THERE'S NOBODY ELSE THAT'S PUTTING THIS THIS COMBINATION OF OF INGREDIENTS TOGETHER
THE ONLY LIMITATIONS I SEE TO THIS IS THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON TELEVISION ONLY
UH THAT'S THE ONLY THAT'S THE ONLY DRAWBACK I SEE TO THIS
BUT WITH ALL OF THESE OTHER FEATURES I THINK PEOPLE C ONE THING I'M I'M HOPING FOR IS PEOPLE ARE NOT GONNA EVEN NOTICE
THERE'S GONNA BE SOMEBODY GOING HOME AND SAY OH SH THIS THING DOESN'T WORK FOR MY D. V. D. AND MY BUT I LIKE THESE OTHER THINGS
SO THEY KEEP IT THEY DON'T TAKE IT BACK
WELL ONE OF ONE OF THE THOUGHTS THAT I HAD IS CAN CAN THIS UNIT BE BE PRODUCED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT UPGRADABLE
YOU KNOW UH LIKE LIKE A UM A SIM CARD IN A IN A UM IN A TELEPHONE
YOU KNOW IS THERE A CARD IN TH CAN WE MAKE A CARD AND SO AFTER
MM-HMM BUT YOU FOLLOW WHAT I'M S I'M S
YEAH 'CAUSE IF IF WE CAN MAKE THIS UNIT UPGRADABLE THEN WE'RE YEAH BUT THEN WE TALK ABOUT CHANGING THE WARRANTY CONCEPT AND EVERYTHING
BUT THAT'S THAT WAS JUST AN IDEA I HAD
UH TO ME THE ONLY ADDITIONS
YEAH
YEP
BUT ANYWAY THAT'S UH
MM-HMM
WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT A CURVE AND A DROOP
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT
OOH
NO I THINK WE COME UP WITH A WITH A ATTRACTIVE MARKETABLE UM PRODUCT AND AND CONCEPT
YEAH WELL WE WE WE KINDA BROKE WE KINDA AT LEAST ADJUSTED EVERY EVERY CRITERIA THEY GAVE US BECAUSE WE D WE STILL HAVE THE THE TELETEXT CAPABILITY IN THIS THING RIGHT
WE RAISED THE PRICE OF IT WE'VE ADDED TWO T NEW TECHNOLOGY TO IT
SO YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IF THIS THING FLIES THEN WE'VE WE'VE ADJUSTED OR BROKEN EVERY EVERY IDEA THEY GAVE US
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT I LIKE I MEAN WHEN I SAY WE HAVE WE HAD I BELIEVE WE HAVE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY 'CAUSE W THIS IS WE DID IT
COHESIVE YEAH
YES SYNERGISTIC YEAH
YEAH
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE ON THE RECORDING IN THERE FROM THAT MICROPHONE IS YOUR LUNCH DIGESTING YOU KNOW TH
NEW IDEAS F UH FOR THE PRODUCT OR FOR THE THE THE THE ENVIRONMENT OR WHAT ARE WE TA
OH
WELL I I MEAN CLEARLY REMOTE CONTROL MICROPHONES WOULD BE THE WOULD BE A NICE SOLUTION TO ALL THESE CABLES
BUT I'M SURE THAT THERE'S THERE'S SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE THINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
AND OF COURSE I DID NOT HAVE SO MUCH FUN WITH MY COMPUTER THIS AFTERNOON
IT'S NOT BEEN UH IT'S NOT BEEN COOPERATING SO WELL BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE
THAT'S AVOIDABLE
NO
OKAY
SO WE NEED TO CLOSE THIS MEETING YEAH BRAVO
CONGRATULATIONS
S I'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERWORK TO CATCH UP ON SO LET'S CLOSE THIS AND COME BACK AND 'KAY
SO WE CAN START
SUPPOSE I HAVE TO DO MY PRESENTATION
EH UM
SO I'LL PRESENT MYSELF I'M ADA LONGMUND AND AS YOU MAY KNOW IT I'M THE PR PROJECT MANAGER
SO UM WE WILL HAVE TO
UM SPEAK ABOUT M THE PROJECT
OUR PROJECT PROJECT IS TO CREATE UM A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND AS YOU MAY KNOW THERE'S LOT OF INDUSTRIALS INTERESTING IN CREATING A REMOTE CONTROL
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND UM USER FRIENDLY
RECORD
SO THE PROJECT METHOD IS THE FOLLOWING
SO IF WE'RE UM THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN YOU HAVE TO DO UH ANY INDIVIDUAL WORK AND UH ALSO WORK WITH UH MEETINGS TALKING WITH EACH OTHER
UH IT WILL BE THE SAME FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND ALSO THE SAME FOR THE DETAILED DESIGN
UH
THE TOOL TRAINING IS TO TRY OUT THE WHITE BOARD SO
MAYBE YOU CAN DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL
AND MAKE A LIST OF ITS FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW MAYBE LATER LATER
SO THE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT'S QUITE GOOD PRICE YEAH
AND UH
IT WILL UH BE A
AN INTERNATIONAL REMOTE CONTROL AS WE WANT TO SELL IT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD AND THE PRODUCT COSTS WILL BE NOT MORE THAN TWELVE EUROS AND FIFTY CENTIMES
SO AS YOU WILL DISCUSS ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPERIENCE YOUR UM WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM JUST UH MAYBE BE IMAGINATIVE WITH REMOTE CONST CON CONTROLS TRY TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW AND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO TO BUY
AND AND THE NEXT MEETING WILL START IN THIRTY MINUTES
SO YOU'LL HA ALL HAVE YOUR SPETHISFISPIS SPECIF SPECIFIC ROLE AND YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
AND UH YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK ON THE DESIGN AND ALSO TO WORK ON THE DESIGN OF TH TECHNICAL FUN FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THINK OF THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS
YEAH
I. D. YEAH
SO
SO I WILL MANAGE ALL ALL THE GROUP
SO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
SO YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THE PARTS OF THE WORK YOU HAVE TO DO
MM-HMM
AND YOU
MM OKAY
HMM
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE TO DESIGN IT AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE INDUSTRIAL WAY TO TRANSFORM IT
AND I MAYBE YOU WILL TRANSFORM IT
MAYBE IT IS THE OUTSIDE AND THE INSIDE
AND YEAH
AND WHEN DESIGNING Y THE REMOTE CONTROL JUST REMEMBER THAT UH IT HAS TO BE A KIND OF INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO SOMETHING REALLY SPECIFIC AS EVERYBODY EVERYBODY WILL HAVE TO USE IT IT'S SOR THE SAME AS KEYBOARDS
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE QWERTY AZERTY FRENCH AND U. K. KEYBOARD SO REALLY THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE INTERNATIONAL
AND NOT TOO EXPENSIVE
AS WE WANT TO MAXIMISE THE BENEFIT
YEAH YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PRODUCT COST WON'T BE MAXIM MORE THAN TWELVE DOT FIFTY EUROS
AND TO BE SURE THAT REALLY PEOPLE WILL BE INTERESTED IN BUYING A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WITH MAYBE NEW FUNCTIONALITIES THAT DON'T EXIST IN THE MM EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS NOW
SO IS IT OKAY
SO YOU THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW
YOU WANT ME TO DRAW SOMETHING
PRODUCT MANAGER OKAY LET'S GO I WILL TRY
NO
A MOUSE IS NOT TOO DIFFICULT
MOUSE IS OKAY
YOU LOVE THE EYES
YEAH THAT WAS THE EYES
A CLOWN
RABBIT
IT'S A RABBIT
YEAH
THANK YOU
YOU FORGOT THE CHIPS
FISH AND CHIPS
OF
OH
OH YEAH
YEAH I THINK YEAH
JUST HAVE TO
PRESENT PROJECT DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT
YEAH
SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
IT'S OKAY
YOU KNOW YOUR JOB
YOU KNOW YOUR JOB
YOU KNOW YOUR JOB
OKAY
SO YEAH I THINK YOU CAN DO IT
TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEP
YEAH
THAT'S ME
OKAY
YEAH
NO I'M USER INTERF I'M USER INTERFACE DESIGN
OKAY
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
USER INTERFACE DESIGN D INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
YEAH I THINK SO
OKAY SO I MAKE UH U USER INTERFACE
YOU YOU DE YOU IMPLEMENT THE CORE FUNCTIONS IN THE
USE IT
MAKE MAKE YEAH
MAYBE I THINK UH UH I INDUSTRIAL DESIGN'S UH IT'S THE FUNCTION DESIGN
I DESIGN THE USER F USER INTERFACE YOU DESIGN THE FUNCTION
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
AND UH SIMPLE
AND EASY TO USE
AH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YOU TRY
TRY FIRST
YOU CAN DRAW SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY SIMPLE
OH MAYBE WE SHOULD BRING KEMY HERE
KEMY IS REALLY GOOD AT DRAWING
YOU'RE GOING TO DRAW
OKAY
WHAT'S THIS
IT'S A FAT CAT
CAN YOU DRAW UH UM RABBIT
OH HAT HA RAT
YEAH
YEAH IT'S OKAY
MM
OKAY
OH
OKAY I DRAW
THE ONLY THING I CAN DRAW IS LIKE THIS
OH
OH
OH
NO
WHAT'S THIS
OKAY
OKAY
THE ONLY THING I CAN DRAW BECAUSE IT'S VERY SIMPLE
OH
OKAY BE CAREFUL
NO PROBLEM NO PROBLEM
A PERSON
DOG
OKAY
OKAY
SO WE HAVE BREAK
OH
HMM
NO
OKAY
AH OKAY
IT'S ADA LONGMUND
MAYBE SOMEONE HA WE HAVE TO THIS WHITEBOARD YEAH
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
I IT'S IT'S REASONABLE S QUITE YEAH
TWENTY FIVE
IS
YEAH
I I HOPE SO
I. D. IS FOR THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN YEAH
AND U. I. D. IT'S FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER YEAH
AMI YEAH PROJECT
YOU WILL BE THE MANAGER YEAH
I AM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN YEAH
I AM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SO
IT'S DIFFICULT
YOU KNOW VERY SOON
SO
I I THINK THE USER THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN IS HE WILL DESIGN HOW THE USER WILL YOU KNOW THE RELATION BETWEEN THE USER AND YOU KNOW THE REMOTE CONTROL SO
AND THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IT IS HOW THE OBJECT WILL LOOK LIKE
YEAH
SO THE MATERI
OKAY RIGHT
BUT I WAS THINKING THAT HE'S A USER 'CAUSE THE USER INTERFACE TO DESIGN FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE BUT BUTTON WILL BE YOU KNOW
BUT I DON'T KNOW
OKAY
I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
SO
OKAY
SO AND THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL
OK OKAY
IT SHOULD BE
THERE WAS A STEP ABOUT DRAWING SOMETHING IN THE IN THE BOARD I DON'T KNOW
IS IT
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO RIGHT NOW
OH RIGHT IT'S IT'S FROM THE LEFT TO THE RI IT'S
I D I WAS THINKING BUT I N I'M NOT SURE NOW
OH
EVERYBODY
I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD DO IT SO
IT'S NOT MATTER
SO
YEAH
IT'S A IT'S A CAT
IT IS NOT A FAT CAT
YEAH IT IS A
YES YOU HAVE TO DRAW A RAT IF YOU WANT A RAT
IT'S YOUR RAT
OKAY GO
RIGHT BUT IN GROW IT'S EVERYBODY HAS TO GROW
WHAT ARE YOU I DON NO IDEA SO
IT'S A RABBIT
IT'S NOT SO BAD SO
SO YOU DON'T HAVE A
A FISH
THAT'S A THAT'S A FISH
OKAY LET'S TRY TO DRAW SOMETHING
HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL
AH IT'S MY TURN
OKAY
SO
IT'S OK SO WHAT CAN I DRAW SOME MORE
NO
MM
YEAH IT'S IT'S A SE IT'S MY PRIORITY THIS ONE
YEAH
NO
IT'S A REALLY CRAZY DOG
OKAY
TRANSFER
IT'S A DOG IN A VILLAGE
SO WHAT ARE YOU SUG GOING TO DO NOW
IT'S DONE
OH MY GOD
YEAH IT'S OKAY
WE HAVE AN IDEA YEAH
I HAVE AN IDEA OF MY JOB SO YEAH SO
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO RIGHT NOW

THOSE THINGS JUST REFER TO EACH OF EACH OF US I THINK
AMI AND OKAY
OKAY
OKAY AND MARKETING EXPERT IT'S ME
YOU CAN MANAGE ALL THIS YEAH
GOOD
UM
NOT REALLY
SO WHICH YOU THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
OKAY
YEAH
I MEAN YOU HAVE TO KNOW
AH YOU HAVE TO KNOW IT
IT'S YOUR JOB SO I HOPE YOU YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
MM
YEAH
OKAY
WELL
YOU KNOW
OH OKAY OKAY
NOT THE OTHER ONE
YEAH
I'M JUST GO I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU SOME TRENDS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND WHAT THE USERS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AND THEN THI THIS WOULD I GUESS CONVERGED TO THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER WI AND THEN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
MM
MM-HMM
AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT UNDER TWELVE EUROS AND F FIFTY SO
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
MM
IT'S CLEAR
YEAH MAYBE SHOULD GO AND DRAW AN ANIMAL
MANY
YEAH
UH IT'S THE SAME AS MINE
IT'S THE FAT CAT OKAY
A RAT
THAT'S DIFFICULT
YEAH
JUST GO YOU YOU THE CLOSEST TO THE WHITEBOARD
JUS
YEAH
A DUCK
PIKACHU
OH YEAH
BUGS BUNNY ONE
OKAY
I GO
WHAT
OH
SO WHAT ELSE
THIS WAS MY FAVOURITE ONE BUT
RIGHT
A FISH
OH YEAH DOESN'T LOOK SO FINE
OKAY IT'S YOUR TURN
MM
GOOD
I THINK IT'S DONE
YEAH
OH WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES FOR THE MEETING
OKAY
KNOW WHAT TIME IS IT
NO
GOOD
MM-HMM
MARKETING EXPERT
MM
OKAY
YEAH
NO SURE
UH IT'S DAVID JORDAN
COURSE
MM-HMM
NO NO
UH THIS ONE DOESN'T WANT TO BE MOVED I THINK
SO I DUNNO IT'S MAYBE DIFFICULT TO HAVE BOTH I MEAN THE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT DOESN'T LOOK SO SIMPLE AND
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND THEN
YEAH
OH IT SHOULD OKAY YEAH
THE USER SHOULD KNOW
YEAH THAT'S GONNA BE THE TRICK
OKAY
SO THAT'S THE POINT
MM
TRUE
OKAY
WHAT THE COST IS
TWELVE TWELVE A HALF
THAT MIGHT JUST SO
OKAY
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY THEN
BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE USER FIRST AND I DON'T THINK THE USER WOULD BE READY TO HAVE A
I DON'T THINK WELL YEAH I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BUT IN A SENSE
THE WIRE
YEAH
TRUE
UH THAT'S MY JOB
THAT'S THE
NOW THE
YEAH
WELL THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE POINT YEAH
TRUE
THIS YOU WILL SEE IN MY PRESENTATION THEN
YEAH
WHICH IS PARTICIPANT FOUR
SO JUST TRYING TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS IF THE USER WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE SOMETHING OR SOMETHING ELSE UH
WE'VE MADE A STUDY SO COULD YOU GO TO NEXT SLIDE
SORRY FOR THE FUNCTIONAL RECURRENCE
SO THAT'S THE STANDARD METHOD FOR MARKETING OKAY
WE HAD ONE HUNDRED SUBJECTS UM
WE OBSERVE THEIR REMOTE CONTROL USE IN A LAB AND THEN AFTER ALL THE EXPERIMENTS THEY HAD TO FILL UP A QUESTIONNAIRE UM
AND SEE WHAT WAS OKAY OR NOT FOR THEM
OKAY
SO THEN IT'S SOME STATISTICS ABOUT WHAT WE OBSERVED AND WHAT THEY ANSWERED
UM ACTUALLY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS FIND M THE MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UH UGLY OKAY SO THAT'S
YEAH THE THE LOOK IS IS BAD FOR THEM SO UH IT'S YOUR JOB DAVID MAYBE
THEN EIGHTY PERCENT OF USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY UM
ACTUALLY IF IF THE REMOTE CONTROLS WERE NOT SO UGLY
SO THIS IS WHERE WE COULD HAVE UH
YEAH GOOD MARKET I GUESS IF PEOPLE ARE READY TO PAY MORE
SO IT'S IT'S INTERESTING INFORMATION I THINK
AND THEN UM
YEAH THE REMOTE CONTROLS LIKE THE ONE YOU'VE SHOWN PREVIOUSLY
IT'S NOT SO DOESN'T FIT THE USER REQUIREMENTS SOMETIME BECAUSE IT'S TOO MANY BUTTONS AND SO ON
SO WE SHOULD CHANGE THIS AS WELL
AND UH
USERS ARE ACTUALLY ZAPPING A LOT SO THEY'RE USING THE DEVICE INTENSIVELY THAT'S SOMETHING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL
AND UM YOU KNOW TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS ARE ACTUALLY USED IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND UH THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN POINT FOR ME
BUT I'LL COME BACK TO IT LATER
'KAY
COULD YOU GO NEXT SLIDE
UH SO AS YOU SAID UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM
SO THIS IS FROM THE EXPERIMENTS WE'VE DONE SO IF WE COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THIS WOULD BE INTERESTING FOR THE USER I THINK
UM IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE
AND UH REMOTE CONTROL ARE REALLY BAD FOR R. S. I. PROBLEMS FOR TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF THE USERS
R. S. I. IS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE USING THE SAME UM DOING THE SAME MOVEMENT SEVERAL TIMES THEN YOU GET INJURED
OKAY
SO THOSE NUMBERS ARE LESS IMPORTANT THEN THE PREVIOUS ONE BUT STILL IT HAS TO BE TAKEN TO COUNT
SO LAST SLIDE
UM SO MY PRES PERSONAL PREFERENCES FOR THIS PROBLEM IS WE HAVE TO MEET THE USER NEEDS
IF WE CAN MAKE IT LOOK FANCY THEN WE MIGHT SELL MORE THAN OUR UH CONCURRENT OKAY
AND DEFINITELY IF IT COULD HAVE LESS BUTTONS STILL MAYBE THE SAME NUMBER OF UM FUNCTIONS
BUT LESS BUTTONS THIS WOULD DEFINITELY BE A GOOD WAY OF SELLING MORE
OKAY
SO
YEAH REMEMBER THE USER IS NOT HAPPY TO READ THE
MANUAL
IT'S
YEAH
YEAH THIS IS SOMETHING WE SH
BUT THIS WAS FIRST STEP AND
THIS WAS THE FIRST STEP YEAH
SPECIALLY DISTRIBUTION YEAH
UH
YEAH BUT THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD ASK TO THE USERS SO
YEAH
YEAH REMEMBER IT'S TWELVE EUROS
HMM
YEAH IT'S DONE JUST YEAH
IF WE WOULD IF WE COULD REMEMBER LIKE NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS AND MAKE IT LOOK FANCY I THINK IT WOULD MAKE IT
SO
LAME OR
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO HAS TO BE YELLOW
I DON'T THINK IT'S PART OF THE REMOTE CONTROL DESIGN ANYWAY
IT'S MAYBE MORE IN BROWSING
YEAH
HM MM
MM-HMM
MIN
YEAH
REGARDING THE FIRST LINE WHAT
SO WE'RE JUST EXPECTING NO MORE USE OF THE TELETEXT
AND THAT'S IT
IT'S ALREADY CHANGED FOR
MM-HMM
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
YEP
OKAY
YEAH
INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
ONE ONE
THREE THREE IT'S THREE SORRY
IN ONE SORRY
SO YOU DIDN'T SAVE IT MAYBE
ALRIGHT SO
DAVID JORDAN
MM-HMM
TOO GREAT FOR EMAIL THEN
YEAH
TO MERGE THE TWO SYSTEM HUH
MM YEP
BUT BUT THIS IS
YEAH
YEAH YOU MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WHERE YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN USE ONE IS THE OTHER ARE OR ALMOST THE SAME SO THE SIGN
YEAH YEAH
FOR EXAMPLE I DUNNO HERE ESCAPE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ESCAPE IN COMPUTERS YOU HAVE
SO IF YOU SEE ESCAPE YOU KNOW THAT IT SHOULD BE THE SAME
SO YOU HAVE TO THE SH THE USER THERE FOR EXAMPLE THE POWER OFF BUTTON IT IS SOMETHING VERY INTERNATIONAL YOU KNOW THAT
SO
YEAH
SO
YEAH BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW TO MERGE YOU KNOW THE GOOGLE SYSTEM TO THE SYSTEM ALRIGHT
THAT'S YOUR JOB
IT YOU
OKAY OKAY
PARTICIPANT TWO
YEAH
THE RATIONALE MUST BE DESIGN OR
SO WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE
AS YOU ALL KNOW YOU KNOW M MY JOB IS TO DESIGN YOU KNOW UH
TO GIVE AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO THE RE BASICALLY THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL BE YOU KNOW INFRARED CONTROL SO THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO RELATE THE
HOW TO RELATE THE REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS ONE I H I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND AND THE T. V.
SO THIS ONE IS LEATHER BU BASED BUT
I PROPOSE A NIFRA INFRARED BASE YOU KNOW
SO SO FOR ME I THINK THAT IT IS BETTER IT'S BET IT'S BETTER TO CONTROL T. V. SO YOU KNOW
SO IT'S IT WILL BE CHEAPER AND IT IS LESS TECHNOLOGY THAN YOU KNOW
FOR THE CHEAP PRICE WE HAVE FOR THE CHEAP PRICE WE WANT TO
I THINK IT'S CHEAPER THAN LASER SO
YEAH I THINK FOR THE COST WE WANT FOR THE COST WE WANT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE UH UH
LET'S SEE
YEAH
YOU CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE SO
SO THE DI THE DIFFEREN THE FINDINGS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU FIND INSIDE THE RE I THE THE SYSTEM HERE INSIDE IT IS JUST
YOU KNOW A BULB AND AN INFRARED BULB SO HERE FOR EXAMPLE THE INFRARED BULB WILL BE HERE AND THE BULB IT WILL BE SOMEWHERE INSIDE
YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
I HAVE SOME KIND OF PICTURES
YOU KNOW HERE
YOU HAVE THE B THE BULB
IT IS A BLUE THE BLUE STUFF HERE AND THE INFRARED AND THE INFRARED BULB IT IS THE RED STUFF YOU KNOW AND SO AND YOU HAVE THE OTHER SUBCOMPONENT THAT ARE NOT REALLY HERE SO IMPORTANT
SO
THIS IS IN FACT SOME OTHER COMPONENT THAT ARE IN BETWEEN THE ELECTRICAL DE THE ELECTRONIC DEVICE
LOOK
BUT HERE WHAT I WANTED TO EMPHASISE IT IS JUST YOU KNOW THE BULB AND
SO AND THE NEXT SLIDE IT IS THE LAST ONE IT'S SO IT'S
I THINK IT SHOULD BE WIRE WIRELESS RE REMOTE CON
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S EASIER TO MANAGE AND YOU KNOW
BECAUSE YOU F THE B THE THE BATTERY PROBLEM CAN HOLD YOU KNOW WILL YOU USE A BATTERY OR THE A WIRE TO CONNECTED YOU
OR MAYBE SOME KIND OF THING THAT WE CAN HAVE BOTH BUT YOU KNOW I AT MY SIDE PREFER A WIRELESS
OKAY SO IF YOU HAVE SOME QUESTION I DIDN'T ANSWER
WELL THE AVERA THE AVERAGE PRICES I THINK THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL COST I DUNNO AROUND EIGHT EUROS SO
OR AT LEAST YOU KNOW THE
YOU'D YES YOU CAN
IT'S SO SO BRES YOU HAVE TO DECIDE HOW HOW YOU WILL YOU KNOW PUT SOME ENERGY INSIDE
SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT WIRELESS OR YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A QUESTION THAT WE CAN RAISE SO
WE CAN THINK THAT YOU KNOW WITH THE WIRE YOU KNOW WITHOUT A WIRE
WE CAN HAVE BOTH ALSO
YEAH BUT SOME PA
I ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE YOU KNOW SOMETIME I WANT TO HAVE WIRE BECAUSE YOU KNOW
UH I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE TOO MUCH
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION YOU KNOW 'CAUSE IT'S I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS YOU KNOW
I THINK WHA WHA WITH THE WIRE IT'S MM CHEAPER BUT YOU KNOW THE WIRELESS IT'S MORE PRACTICAL SO
OKAY YEAH
YEAH BUT IT SHOULD BE AN AGREEMENT YOU KNOW BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU CAN THINK OF THE WIRELESS
IT IS IT'S IT IS THE JOB OF THE THE THE G GRAPHICAL USER DESIGNER BUT YOU KNOW
IF IT IS A LOT CHEAPER AND IF YOU WANT TO REACH FOR EXAMPLE SOME
THE THE MONEY YOU HAVE IF YOU WANT TO USE SO IT CAN BE GOOD TO HAVE A WIRELESS IT IT IS A QUESTION
RIGHT SO
OKAY
MM-HMM
THE LOOK HOW IT LOOK LIKE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
THE MANUALS
WITH A
LOOK FANCY
THIS IS A QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE ASKED TO THE
IF YOU ASK THE PEOPLE MAYBE THE THE MARKETING PEOPLE
I THINK THE SOLUTION IS TO HAVE MANY COLOURS OF YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE GREY STANDARD
YEAH YEAH MAYBE
YEAH MAYBE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH HMM
YEP
SO
YELLOW
FOR CHEAP REMOTE CONTROL YEAH
YEAH
YEAH 'CAUSE WHAT I'M THINKING IS HOW WILL YOU WILL CONNECT THE T. V. TO INTERNET SO
THIS IS
YEAH BUT THIS THIS MEAN THAT YOUR T. V. WOULD BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW CONNECT TO INTERNET YOU KNOW SURF THE WEB
OKAY
IT'S POP I DON'T THINK IT'S POPULAR SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM SO
YOU HAD I IF YOU ARE DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL FOR YOU KNOW
THE GLOBAL USAGE SO IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY
YELLOW
DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE LIKE THE COLOUR YELLOW
I THINK IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW TH LIKE A YELLOW RIBBON HERE IS THE DOUBLE R.
OR SHOULD BE
YEAH SO
DOESN'T NEED TO BE COMPLETELY YELLOW BUT JUST MM
BUT I DUNNO BUT WHY NOBODY'S A THREAT TO ME
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER YEAH
COMPONENT COMPONENT YEAH
GOOD
OKAY OKAY THAT'S CLEAR
SO I WILL OPEN OUR FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING
SO I WILL PLAY ROLE OF THE SECRETARY
AS ALSO PROGRAM MA MANAGER
SO WE WILL HAVE THE THREE PRESENTATIONS FROM THE
IN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER USER INTERFACE DESIGNER AND UM
WHAT'S YOUR TALK
MARKETING EXPERTS
AND AFTER THAT WE UH WILL HAVE THE
UH
NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
THE DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
AND WE WILL
CLOSE THE MEETINGS AFTER
MM SO
UM I SUPPOSE THE FIRST TO DO THE PRESENTATION WILL BE THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
UM SO YOU'RE PARTICIPANT TWO
NO YOU'RE
NO I'M PARTICIPANT ONE
OKAY NEVER MIND
'KAY DID YOU SAVE YOUR PRESENTATION
ISN'T THAT TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
NAME'S JORDAN
SO
SO I'LL
I LET DAVID JORDAN DO HIS PRESENTATION
UH
MM
SO YOU PROPOSE TO TO HAVE THE
REMOTE CONTROL WHICH WILL BE POWERFUL
SO POWERFUL
MANY FUNCTIONS AND VERY EASY TO USE
YOU MEAN THIS ONE
YEAH YOU HAVE TO LEARN THE MANUAL BEFORE USING THIS REMOTE CONTROL I SUPPOSE
OH YOU MEAN FOR THE YEAH PIC PICTOGRAMS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
YEAH UM SUCH AS MAYBE THE
GO ON GO BACK AND
SO YOU WILL PROPOSE US SOMETHING WHICH IS
YEAH SO POWERFUL AND EASY TO USE
OKAY
SO NEXT I PROPOSE THE INDUSTRIAL USER INTERFACE TO PRESENT THINGS
SO YOU YOU'RE
UM
OKAY
SO BABA IS THE UH THE INDUSTRIAL
DESIGNER
OKAY
MM-HMM
SO YOU MEAN THAT INFRARED CONTROL IS A CHEAP TECHNOLOGY
YEAH
DO Y YOU KNOW THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
TWELVE NEARLY THIRTEEN YEAH
THE COST
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
WHAT IS THIS
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO YOU THINK THAT UH
A CABLE BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. WON'T BE A GOOD IDEA
NO IT WOU MAYBE IT WILL BE CHEAPER I DUNNO I JUST MAY MAYBE YOU MAKING A SOLU
YEAH BUT
YEAH BUT AS INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER DO YOU THINK THAT IT WILL BE FEASIBLE TO HAVE UH LINKED OR TO HAVE LINK BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE TELEVISION
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE CHEAPER
COULD YOU ANSWER PLEASE
OKAY
YEAH BUT I THINK THE WIRELESS PROBLEM IS MORE THE UM DAVID JORDAN'S PROBLEM
AS IT'S YEAH
I THINK IT'S MORE YOUR PROBLEM
MAYB MAYBE YOU HAVE JUST TO TO KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRY TO ASK PEOPLE IF THEY WILL LIKE SOMETHING WIRELESS OR NOT
OKAY I'M SORRY
SO
SO JUST THINK OF UM THE USABILITY
YEAH
JUST THINK OF THE PROBLEM
IF WHEN YOU HAVE WIRELESS REMOTE CONTROL AND IF YOU LOSE IT
I THINK IT'S WOULD BE EASIER TO HAVE A LINK BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE TELEVISION YEAH
SO I WILL LET YOU TO DO YOUR PRESENTATION SO
YOU MEAN THE LOO THE LOOK THE OUTSIDE
OKAY
MM-HMM
WHAT IS R. S. I.
AH UM OKAY
MM-HMM
MM OKAY
AND JUST TO HAVE UH AN IDEA DO YOU THINK YOU AS THE
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER TO WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE LESS BUTTONS AND STILL HAVE THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY AND TO HAVE POWERFUL REMOTE CONTROL YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
SURE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE EASY TO USE
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE MANY FUNCTIONS JUST FOR ONE BUTTON IT WOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT FOR THE USER TO KNOW
YEAH I THINK THE
YEAH BUT IT HAS TO BE INTUITIVE
YEAH OKAY
OKAY BUT
YEAH BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT I THINK IT WILL INCREASE THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCTION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
IF YOU NEED TO HAVE SPECIAL COLOURS FOR REMOTE CONTROLS IT WILL COST MORE
YEAH IT WILL COST LITTLE BIT MORE
AND ALSO F
YEAH BUT AS SOON AS YOU SPEAK ABOUT OPTIONS IT MEANS THAT THE PRICE INCREASES
AND WE DON'T REALLY WANT THE PRICE TO BE TOO TOO HIGH BECAUSE WE WANNA BE ABLE TO PRODUCE IT
SO WE WANT SOMETHING FANCY AS UH PREVIOUSLY SAID FLORENT SOMETHING VERY EASY TO USE POWERFUL AND ALSO AS UH IT'S WRITTEN HERE
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS THEY ZAP LOT SO MAYBE JUST HAVING MANY FUNCTIONS IN ONE BUTTON IS NOT THAT GOOD IF YOU WANT TO ZAP A LOT
AND THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO ZAP BETWEEN FUNCTIONS OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROL THEY WANT TO ZAP BETWEEN CHANNELS ON T. V.
SO
I THINK YOU HAVE QUITE LOT OF POINTS TO TO THINK ABOUT AND TO DISCUSS IT WITH UH THE OTHER MEMBERS
SO IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR PRESENTATION
NOTHING ELSE TO TO ADD
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM SO
SO I HAD SOME
NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS SO YOU WILL HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF IT OF IT IN YOUR THINKING IN YOUR DESIGNING OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO THE FIRST ONE IS THAT UM FOR THE DESIGNING OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE THE TELETEXT ANYMORE AS IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S
IT'S IS UH
NO YEAH BECAUSE NOW EVERYBODY HAS INTERNET AT HOME SO IT'S BETTER TO USE INTERNET THEN TELETEXT
SO YOU WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT IN YOUR IN IN THE DESIGN OF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
AND ALSO THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL ONLY BE USED FOR TELEVISION SO
FOR Y FOR YOU YOUR DESIGNING
YOU'RE NOT YOU WON'T BE UH YOU WON'T HAD UM BUTTONS TO JUST TO MANIPULATE YEAH TO CONTROL THE RECORDER OR MAYBE THE GARAGE DOOR OR THINGS LIKE THAT
IT'S BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO
TO DO REMOTE CONTROL
WHICH WILL BE USED FOR FOR THE TELEVISION FOR THE RECORDER FOR THE CAMCORDER AND ALL THE OTHERS
IT WILL BECOME TOO COMPLEX AND IT WILL INCREASE THE PLI THE PRICE AND WE CAN'T DO THAT
WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE TELEVISION
IS IT OKAY
SO MAYBE IT WILL BE EASIER FOR YOU TO TO DESIGN IT TO HAVE VERY POWERFUL AND EASY
AND ALSO WE WANT THE IMAGE OF THE UH UM REAL REACTION BE RECOGNISABLE IN THE PRODUCT SUCH AS THE COLOUR AND S THE SLOGAN
I MEAN THAT'S UH IF UH YOU WANT TO BUY A REMOTE CONTROL AND IF YOU GO IN A SHOP AND IF YOU SEE THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU WILL RECOGNISE DIRECTLY THAT S IT'S OUR PRODUCT
SO YOU WILL HAVE TO USE THE COLOUR OF THE PRODUCT OF THE UM UM
OF THE UH OF REAL REACTION
AND UH ALSO
YEAH
AS WE SAY WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO IT HAS TO BE A FASHION REMOTE CONTROL
FANCY FASHION POWERFUL EASY TO USE
REQUIRE LOT OF REQUIREMENTS BUT
YEAH
YEAH
BUT UH THAT'S YOUR YOUR JOB TO FIND SOMETHING MM MATCHES
MAYBE NOT BUT MAYB
SO
SO EVERYBODY IS OKAY WITH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS
I THINK IT HAS TO BE YELLOW
YEAH
MAYBE YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR BUT THE IMAGE OF THE SOCIETY HAS TO BE RECOGNISED
WHY YOU GO
IT HAS TO BE FASHION
SO YOU HAVE TO
YEAH
IT HAS TO BE A FASHION AND REALLY BE UH THE IMAGE OF THE SOCIETY
JUST WHEN YOU ENTER YOU SAY OH OH IT'S REAL REACTION
THINK IT'S A RE REACTION REMOTE CONTROL SO
AND ALSO IT HAS TO BE ATTRACTIVE OF COURSE BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO SALE TO SELL THE REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT WOULD BE SIMPLER
OKAY
SO
I WILL CLOSE THE MEETING UM JUST AFTER THAT WE'LL HAVE LUNCH BREAK
AND YOU WILL HAVE IN THIRTY MINUTES INDIVIDUAL WORK
UH
Y YOU
YOU WILL HAVE AS THE I. D. I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IS INDUSTR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TO PUT UM PON YEAH
AND THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER TO WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT
AND FLORENT TO
WORK MY SUBJECT
AND SO SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
IT'S OKAY
I THINK THE UM SESSION IS CLOSED
AND BY THE WAY MISTER DAVID JORDAN PLEASE RECORD YOUR PRESENTATIONS IN YOUR OWN FOLDER
NOT IN MINE
SHOULD BE BETTER
OKAY
OKAY
NO NO NO
ONE
I I THINK I'M A
IN ONE
IT'S MINE
MM YEAH
OKAY
OKAY SO
THE FIRST I WILL PRESENT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN FOR USER INTERFACE FOR OUR UH REMOTE T. V. CONTROL
UH I I WILL FOCUS ON USER INTERFACE DESIGN
UM SO MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE
AS WE KNOW OUR
REMOTE C REM REMOTE T. V. CONTROL IT'S VERY HAS VERY SOPH SOPHISTICATED FUNCTIONS AS WE SHOW FROM THIS PICTURE
THERE'S A LOT OF FUNCTIONS
OVER I THINK OVER
S TWELVE OR TWENTY S FUNCTIONS OF A REMOTE T. V. CONTROL
SO HOW CAN WE
UM DESIGN A USER INTERFACE WITH SO SA WITH SO MANY SOPHISTICATED FUNCTIONS
UM LET'S MOVE TO NEXT SLIDE
UM
YEAH
SO I SO WE WANT TO DESIGN UH ELEGANT EASY TO USE INTER INTERFACE
A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE IS GOOGLE
AS WE KNOW UH GOOGLE IT'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HIS UM POWERFUL FUNCTION BUT WITH VERY EASY TO USE USER INTERFACE
UM SO MOVE TO NEXT S SLIDE
SO MY JOB IS TO UH DESIGN A GOOGLE T. V. CONTROLLER
WHICH I WANT TO HAVE SOPHISTICATED FUNCTIONS WHILE WITH VERY EASY TO USE USER INTERFACE
SO
THAT'S THE END OF THE TALK THE END OF THE PRESENTATION
UH
WITH SOPHISTICATED FUNCTIONS BUT WITH VERY YEAH POWERFUL
YES
YEP
YEAH
BUT IF WE HAVE VERY VERY GOOD USER INTERFACE
IT TAKE LESS TIME FOR USER TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT
YEAH THAT'S MY JOB
THAT'S MY JOB
IT'S NOT THE EASIEST I'VE GOT TO
YEP
POWERFUL AND EASY TO USE
YEAH THAT'S THE POINT
SO WHAT THE WIRELESS REMOTE CONTROL
THERE'S A WIRE WITH REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
WIRELESS REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
DESIGN A WIRELESS REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
FUNCTIONS
YEAH
YEAH I THINK POSSIBLE
BECAUSE WE CAN
WE CAN UH
MIX UH SEVERAL FUNCTION IN ONE BUTTON
SO LETS YOU THEN YOU HAVE LESS BUTTONS
BUT I'M NOT SURE
NO YOU YOU CAN HAVE A SWITCH MENU SO YOU CAN
WELL FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH I THINK SO
LIKE FOR FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN UH YOU CAN CATEGORY THE FUNCTION I I INTO SEVERAL CLASSES
THEN
FOR UM YOU CAN HAVE A SWITCH MENU SO YOU PUT THE SWITCH MENU TO IT IT TEND TO THIS KIND OF THIS CATEGORY OF FUNCTIONS
THEN YOU YOU PUT THE SWITCH BUTTON THEN IT
SWITCH TO ANOTHER CATEGORY OF FUNCTIONS
YEAH
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE REMOTE CONTROL YOU YOU CAN REM YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR T. V. AND ALSO YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR UH RECORDER
SO THERE'S A DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS BUT I IF YOU YOU THERE'S A BUTTON YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN CONTROL T. V. AND CONTROL YOUR RECORDER
SO WE CAN HAS LESS BUTTONS
BUT WHAT I'M NOT SO SURE IS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL LOOK FUNNY LOOK FANCY NOT FUNNY
BECAUSE DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ABOUT FANCY
YOU KNOW
BECAUSE MAYBE A COLOURFUL IS FANCY FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT MAYBE SIMPLE AND UH UNIFORM COLOURFUL IS FANCY FOR SOME FOR OTHER PEOPLES SO
YEAH PERSONALISED COLOUR
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
YEAH BECAUSE MAYBE SOME PEOPLE PREFER A RED REMOTE CONTROL SOME PEOPLE PREFER BLACK REMOTE CONTROL
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE DI DI WE CAN HAVE UH SEVERAL OPTIONS SO USER CAN SELECT WHICH COLOUR THEY PREFER SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
CONTROL
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
BUT THERE'S BALANCE BETWEEN FUNCTION AND THE COST
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM HM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND CHEAP
A LOW COST
YEAH THERE'S THAT BOX IN UH O OF IT
A PI THERE'S THAT BOX IN THE T. V. SO WITH THE SET BOX YOU YOU CAN CONNECT INTERNET WITH YOUR T. V.
OK
IT'S IT'S NOT SO UH POPULAR NOW
MM
GLOBAL OKAY
SO I I SO
AS AS FOR THE COLOUR WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK
YELLOW
T. V. REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
OKAY
MM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO LET'S START OUR SECOND ME MEETING ON CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
SO
AS THE PREVIOUS MEETING I WILL BE THE SECRETARY AND WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS AND WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPT AND FINALLY WE'LL CLOSE THE DECISION
SO I WILL FIRST UH
WHAT
I I THINK I WILL LET UH OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER SPEAK FIRST MISTER DAVID JORDAN
SO WE'LL
S TECHNICAL ACCESSOIRE
INTERFACE
THIS
I'M NOT SURE THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS VERY ATTRACTIVE
IT'S VERY BIG YEAH
OKAY
YEAH WHY NOT
WE'LL HAVE BIG DISCUSSION I SUPPOSE AFTER THAT SO
OKAY
SOMETHING ELSE
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION BECAUSE FOR THE INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER YOU SAID THAT WE CAN USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION OR THE GESTURE RECOGNITION
BUT AS THE UM EXPERT TOLD US MOST OF THE PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO ZAP T TO ZAP BETWEEN CHANNELS
DO YOU THINK THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE GESTURES
BECAUSE IF THEY DO ALL THE TIME THE SAME GESTURE AS YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY IN THE LAST MEETING MAYBE THEY WILL GET INJURIES BECAUSE OF THAT
OR IF YOU SAY CHANNEL THREE CHANNEL THREE TWO THREE FOUR SIX FIVE I THINK THEY WILL BE BORED AFTER A WHILE
YOU DON'T THINK SO
YEAH SURE
I THAT'S TRUE
YEAH BUT SUPPOSE YOU GOT A COLD
YOU HAVE A MUTE REMOTE CONTROLLER
BROKEN ARM
YEAH BUT SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A FAMILY WATCHING T. V.
AND IF THEY WANT TO USE THEIR PRIVATE REMOTE CONTROL IN THE SAME TIME DO YOU THINK IT WILL WORK
EVERYBODY WANTING TO CHANGE CHANNEL IN THE SAME TIME
WHY
IF YOU HAVE ONE BROTHER AND ONE SISTER AND THEY WANT TO WATCH THEIR FAVOURITE UH T. V. PROGRAMME
SO THEY SAY OH CHANNEL FOUR CHANNEL THREE CHANNEL FOUR CHANNEL THREE ALL THE TIME SO
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL SO MAYBE YOU CAN KEEP IT F WITH YOU
YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT OBLIGED TO SHARE IT
YEAH WE CAN YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT'S A DISADVANTAGE
YEAH BUT ONE OTHER QUESTION
HOW HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
YEAH
BECAUSE I SUPPOSE WE NEED TO DO RESEARCH TO HAVE SOMETHING WORKING
SOME SOME EFFICIENT
SO YOU THINK IT WON'T COST AN
NOT A LOT FOR US
OR
YEAH BUT UH UH
MM MM
YEAH
I AGREE WITH UH
YEAH BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM THAT UH BABA TALKED ABOUT IS THE INTERNATIONAL
REMOTE CONTROL
WE NEED SOMETHING THAT IS INTERNATIONAL
SUPPOSE WE'RE WE WANT TO SELL IT IN FRANCE
THE RECOGNITION SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND FRENCH
IF YOU WANT TO GO TO ENGLAND IT WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH SO
MM OKAY
AND WITH NO INCREASE IN THE PRI PRODUCTION PRICE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH BUT HOW WILL YOU
OH
SEEMS TO BE QUITE COMPLEX
AND WHAT ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION DO WE HAVE MICROPHONES
AND WHERE WILL BE THEY
DO YOU THINK IF WE'RE FAR FROM TELEVISION IT WILL WORK
YEAH BUT WHERE IS THE CONTROLLER
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE'RE HERE IT'S UH AN OBJECT
BUT HERE YOU SAY YOU WANT TO USE I UH S TECHNOLOGY
YEAH BUT WHA WHAT IS THE USE OF VOICE OR GESTURE RECOGNITION IF YOU HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL LI LIKE THIS IF YOU HAVE AN OBJECT
IF YOU WANT TO USE VOICE OR GESTURE YOU NEED TO BE FREE WITHOUT ANY OBJECT
YOU JUST WANT TO INTERACT WITH TELEVISION
YEAH BUT YOU CAN LOSE IT
OKAY YOU SO YOU CAN BUILD A KIND OF BLACK BOX AND PUT IT ON T. V. AND JUST TO RECOGNIZE GESTURES AND VOICE
AH
YEAH BUT
MM
I THINK SO
AND MAYBE IT WILL BE QUITE
OKAY
HMM
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE'LL TRY THE CONTROLLERS YOU'D PREFER
WHICH KIND OF CONTROLLER WOULD YOU PREFER TO USE YOU AS A REMOTE CONTROL USER
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO DO ANY INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER AND TO STAY WITH THE GOOGLE CONTROLLER OR A FANCY CONTROLLER
MAYBE TRY TO MIX THE GOOGLE CONTROLLER AND THE FANCY CONTROLLER
HMM
JUST WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING CONTROLLER WHICH IS IN A KIND OF INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER EASY TO USE SOPHISTICATED AND FANCY
YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
YEAH BUT UH WE WANT SO
YEAH BUT W WE WE WANT SOMETHING TH THAT WORKS ALL THE TIME EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR FOR EVERYONE
YOU DON'T NEED TO TUNE IT
YEAH WHY NOT
IF IT'S
NOT TOO EXPENSIVE TOO
OKAY
SO LET'S GO TO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE A DECISION AFTER THAT SO
TWO
WORKING
I CAN
OKAY
IT'S OKAY
UH I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR
MAYBE YOU YOU RECORD IT SOMEWHERE ELSE
INTERFACE CONCEPT
NO
MM MM
UH
NOPE
IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE
YEAH SO
NO I THINK IT WILL BE MORE INTERESTING TO START WITH UH
YEAH
YOU WILL HAD S SOME MORE INFORMATION IN I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING AFTER YOUR PRESENTATION TO HAVE UM BABA'S PRESENTATION
SO
OKAY
OKAY NEVER MIND
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
I THINK IT'S AN ADDED VALUE TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AND MAYBE IT CAN ATTRACT ALL THE ECOLOGICAL K YEAH CONSUMERS AND BUT ABOUT THE THE PRICE OF ADDING THIS SOLAR BATTERY
WOULD IT BE SOMETHING REALLY THAT WILL INCREASE THE PRICE OF PRODUCTION MORE NO
SO
OKAY
AND WHAT THA WHAT ABOUT THE UH
MATERIALS
IMPERSONAL MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH AND I IF YOU WE WANT TO PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS MAYBE WE CAN TRY TO DO SOMETHING WITH WOOD
MM-HMM
MM
MM OKAY SEEMS TO BE INTERESTING MM
YEAH WE WANT SOMETHING EASY TO USE AND SO I THINK MAYBE SOMETHING VERY LOW LEVEL WOU WOULD BE ENOUGH
AND YOU THINK THAT WE WILL BE
OKAY
SO WOOD
AND WHAT ABOUT THE BUTTONS
NO IT'S FASHION YEAH
I DUNNO
I THINK WE HAVE ONLY UH FIVE MINUTES LEFT
PARTICIPANT FOUR
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
THIS ONE
OKAY
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE COMPONENT CONCEPTS ABOUT THE ENERGY
SO AS YOU SAY YOU WANT SOMETHING TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE MAYBE USING SOLAR ENERGY AND WITH BATTERY WOULD BE SOMETHING INTERESTING MAYBE WILL ATTRACT
PRO ECOLOGY CONSUMERS
UH CHEAP IMPRINT SO YOU S YOU PROPOSE LOW LEVEL CHIPS WOULD BE UH ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING WORKING WELL
CASE
SO YOU THINK CASE
SOMETHING SPONGY
SOMETH NO WOOD
MAYBE YOU
IT'S IT'S NATURAL
TH THE FEELING IS NATURAL SO MAYBE WE CAN STAY WITH WOOD
BUT IT'S STILL FASHION
YEAH SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN INTO IT
UH AND WHAT ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT
GOOGLE AND FANCY
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WITH THE VOICE AND GESTURE RECOGNITION THERE ARE STILL SOME
DISADVANTAGES WITH THIS
YEAH BUT YOU NEED A RECEIVER TO RECOGNIZE THE GESTURES AND THE VOICE
THAT'S TRUE
SO MAYBE WE'LL JUST FOCUS ON THE GOOGLE CONTROLLER PLUS THE FANCY CONTROLLER MAYBE TRY TO MIX THEM THESE TWO CONCEPTS TOGETHER
JUST IN ONE AND DO A REMOTE CONTROL WITH SOLAR ENERGY AND BATTERIES AND WITH LEV LOW LEVEL CHIPS AND WOOD
AND L. C. D. BUTTONS
YEAH I THINK FOR THESE SUPPLEMENTS THE SOLAR ENERGY WOULD BE SOMETHING QUITE INTERESTING AND NOT MAYBE TOO DIFFICULT TO ADD
YEAH FOR THE INTERFACE SOMETHING ADDED VALUE
WITH A MODULE
YOU MEAN THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH A MUR MODULE IF YOU WANT YOU CAN JUST USE
COMMANDS WORDS AND USE THEM WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO USE YOUR FINGERS
TURNING THE T. V. O ON O OR OFF
SO ADDING SOME VOCAL COMMANDS
SIMPLE ONES
OKAY
SO THE NEXT MEETING WILL START IN THIRTY MEETI MINUTES SO WE'LL YOU WILL ALL HAVE TO WORK IN
IN YOUR DIRECTION
SO YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN TO HAVE THE EASY TO USE
POWERFUL AND FANCY REMOTE CONTROL WITH SOME ADDED VALUE SUCH AS THE UH SIMPLE VOCAL COMMANDS RECOGNITION
UH YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK MORE BABA
ON THE UM SPONGY WAY TO TO ADD SPONGY UM TOUCH TO THE BUTTONS AND TRY TO FIND MAYBE A NICE SHAPE FOR THE WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL
AND I SUP I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO EVALUATE TH THE PRODUCT TOO
YEAH
YEAH
AND REMEMBER AS AS I SAID LAST MEETING
WE REALLY HAVE TO BUILD A FASHION REMOTE CONTROL AND UH THE COLOUR OF THE UM THE SOCIETY WILL BE REALLY IT WILL BE SEEN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO YOU WILL HAVE BABA AND DAVID JORDAN YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE PROTOTYPE AND YOU WILL HAVE NEXT TIME TO SHOW US UM MODELLING A CL A CLAY REMOTE CONTROL
SO YOU WILL HAVE TO MODEL MODEL SOMETHING
AND I THINK THAT SOME SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
SO NO MORE QUESTIONS WE CAN CLOSE THE SESSION
YEAH
OKAY COOL
MM-HMM
MM
A NICE ONE
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE
OH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD POINT SO
ONE AND
YEP
YEAH BUT YEAH BUT THE SAME CAN HAPPEN EVEN WITH IT YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE THE
THAT'S RIGHT
IT'S IT'S
AND MAYB MAYBE WE CAN HAVE THE SWITCHING MODE TO PASS FROM YOU KNOW VOICE CONTROLLER TO
MANUAL CONTROLLERS EH
NO MORE EXPENSIVE MAYBE
WELL Y Y YOU HAVE ALSO THE LANGUAGE PROBLEM YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
'CAUSE IT IT HAVE TO BE UNIVERSAL SO
YEAH
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW
THE PRODUCT THE PRO
IT'S A VERY SMART IT'S A VERY SMART CONTROLLER MAYBE
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT
YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO S YOU KNOW IF THIS IS A PUSH BUTTON CONTROLLER
YOU CAN SEND THIS CON THIS REMOTE CONTROL EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD THE SAME ONE
IF YOU HAVE THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP FOR EACH COUNTRY
YEAH BUT FOR EACH COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO DO ONE BECAUSE UH THE FOR EXAMPLE FOR SE
OH REALLY
THAT'S
COMPLE
A MICROPHONE MAYBE
TO TALK TO THE TO THE T. V. MAYBE
I IF YOU SAY ONE HE SWITCH TO CHANNEL YEAH
SO WELL FOR EXAMPLE IF IT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM IF I MAYBE IF IT IS IN THE TABLE THERE YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY S CHANNEL ONE AND THE T THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES THE ORDER TO THE T. V. TO SWITCH TO CHANNEL ONE
DEVIC
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT SO YOU NEED A CAMERA AND YOU KNOW A MICROPHONE INSIDE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW SWITCHING FROM ONE COUNTRY TO TO ANOTHER WILL BE A PROBLEM SO ALTHOUGH Y Y
YEAH BUT I I
YEAH WE SHOULD
UH
MM
YEAH BUT
I THINK HE NEED A CONTROL THAT IS VERY RELIABLE SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S NOT REALLY THE WE WE CAN ADD FOR EXAMPLE SOME FUNCTION LIKE FOR BROWSING IN INTERNET SO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT UH I THINK A USER NEED
DON'T HAVE A THE THE
YEAH IF WE CAN SEND EMAIL FROM IT
BECAUSE THE P THE PROBLEM I CAN SEE WITH WITH THE VOICE OR THE GESTURE ITSELF WH WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN A FAMILY I I FOR EXAMPLE IF
YEAH
AND FOR ALL THE PERSON OF THE FAMILY MAYBE SO YEAH
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEW
YE
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH PARTICIPANT TWO UM
YEAH WORKING DESIGN SO
SO
I THINK
CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT ONE
I UH IT'S NOT THIS ONE
IT'S UH OTH THE OTH SO I IT'S THE WORKING DESIGN
SORRY
COMPONENT DESIGN
SO THIS YEAH SO THIS IS THE DESCRIBED USE WHAT
ARE YOU INST
I DON'T THINK SO
OH
MAYBE I RECORD RECORDED DIRECTLY ON THE
COMPUTER
OKAY OKAY
YES
I CAN SAY IT TO YOU WITHOUT
YEAH EXAC
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
IN FACT I DON'T KNOW
I S BECAUSE I IN MY PRESENTATION I DON'T HAVE HERE WITH SO IT WAS IN FACT THE DESIGN USE TO SHOW YOU THE DESIGN OF WHAT IS INSIDE A WHAT IS INSIDE AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT COMPONENT OF THE R
OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING SO I COULD SHOW YOU SOME SOME PICTURE OF WHAT IS INSIDE AND SO
SO I IN FACT THE THE F SOMETHING I WANT TO DISCUSS IS WHICH KIND OF MATERIAL ARE WE GOING TO USE
SO WILL IT WILL BE WOODEN WOODEN DI WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL OR A A PLASTIC REMOTE CONTROL LIKE THIS ONE
SO AND IN WHICH WHICH WHICH KIND WILL BE THE THE DIFFERENT BU BUTTON SO IT CAN BE SOME YOU KNOW
CLASSIC PUSHBUTTON LIKE THIS ONE OR YOU HAVE ALSO SOME BUTTON LIKE L. C. D. WHERE YOU KNOW
THE BUTTON THE BUTTONS ARE UNLIGHTED DURING THE NIGHT OR YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE THEM IN THE DARKNESS
AND
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO DISCUSS ALSO IS WHICH KIND OF ALIMENTATION ELECTRIC ALIMENTATION DO YOU WANT TO HAVE
SO WILL IT BE FOR EXAMPLE UH D UH SOLAR ENERGY ALIMENTATION OR WILL IT BE A BATTERY LIKE THE CLASSICAL BATTERY SO
AND I THINK THAT FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE ALIMENTATION IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE
UH BOTH OF THEM SO SO FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME COUNTRY WHERE YOU ARE IN THE THE COUNTRYSIDE AND YOU ARE FAR FROM YOU KNOW
THE CITIES UH FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME PLACE IN IN S SENEGAL SO IF YOU HAVE ELECTRIC IF YOU HAVE SOLAR ALIMENTATION
YOU JUST
WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE RECHARGER OR REMOTE CONTROL POWER YOU JUST PUT IT ON THE SUN AND AFTER ONE HOUR YOU CAN COME AND SO IT CAN BE INTERESTING FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF REMOTE CON IT CAN BE SOMETHING INTERESTING TO MAKE PEOPLE BUY IT
FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH MM
ECOLOGISTS YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
ALRIGH
IN FACT HAVING THEM BOTH WILL IF WE WANT TO HAVE BATTERY
REGULAR BATTERY AND AND THE SOLAR ENERGY BATTERY IT COULD BE IT'LL IT WILL ADD A LITTLE BIT OF THE PRICE
BUT IT WILL BE AN ADDED VALUE ALSO THAT WILL BE COMPENSATED SO HMM
AND THE MATERIALS IT DEPENDS FOR EXAMPLE YOU IF YOU HAVE A WOODEN MATERIAL IT CAN BE MORE THE PLASTIC MATERIAL IS MORE COMMON IT'S VERY RESISTANT BUT
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WOODEN WILL BE LIKE I DON'T KNOW HIGH CL SO A SPECIAL HIGH CLASS OR YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE SOME
YEAH EVEN IF IT IS NOT COMPLETELY WOOD BUT JUST A PART OF THE
YOU KNOW WILL BE WOODEN IN WOOD AND IT CAN BE INTERESTING
AND SO THE LAST POINT IS Y ALSO WOULD DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME VERY CHEAP
INTEGRATED CIR CIRCUITS CHIPS OR DO YOU HAVE LOW LEVEL OR OR VERY VERY EXPENSIVE
IT DEPENDS BUT I THINK THAT LOW LEVEL WILL BE YOU KNOW IT IS AN INTERIM MODULE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT WILL FIT ON THE PRICE WE WANT TWEL TWELVE EUROS SO
I THINK THE BUTTONS I PR I PREFER YOU KNOW
THE L. C. D. YOU KNOW LIGHTED BUTTONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S I DON'T KNOW UM YEAH IN THE DARK
IT'S FASHION AND IT'S RELATED TO HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS OR UH IF YOU WANT TO WATCH T. V. IN THE DARKNESS OR IF YOU WANT TO LO FIND YOUR FIND YOUR YOUR REMOTE CONTROL THAT IS LOST
YOU KNOW IN THE DARKNESS IT'S VERY EASY SO RIGHT
I THINK A TOUCH SCREEN
WILL BE T AS EXPENSIVE AS THE L. C. D. BUTTONS SO
BUT AND IT IS A KIND OF OTHER DESIGN I MEAN
IT CAN ALSO BE INTERESTING TO HAVE THIS KIND OF
MM
AH YES
YEAH YEAH
OKAY YEAH
OKAY
AND FRUIT AND VEGETABLES YEAH
SPONGY 'KAY
OKAY YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHICH KIND OF MATERIAL DO YOU NEED TO TO BE SPONGY
PLA
S
VERY STUFF OKAY RUBBER RUBBER DESI OKAY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
SOLAR
OKAY
YEAH
IT WILL BE A
YEAH
YEAH I THINK
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
NO WOOD BUT PLASTIC
WOULD SOME
I THINK WE CAN HAVE WOOD FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BOTTOM AND YOU KNOW
IT DEPENDS ON THE DESIGN WE WANT SO
YEAH IT'S NATURAL AND I
AND IT CAN BE CORRELATED TO ENERGY SOLAR ENERGY SO FOR THE MARKETING ASPECT YOU KNOW SAYING THAT IT'S ECOL
MM YEAH IT'S NOT RIGHT SO
OKAY
GOOGLE AND
AND FANCY F HOW ABOUT THE THE VOICE
AND
UH MAYBE WE CAN DO SOME MARKETING STUDIES ASKING PEOPLE IF THEY'RE INTERESTED AND HOW
IT IT IS AN AN INTERESTING CONCEPT TO SEE TO HAVE UH VOICE CONTROL
MM
YEAH
BUT AND THE PROBLEM IS I I'M WE CAN INFER I IF YOU HAVE V VOICE CONTROL WHY NOT TO PUT IT DIRECTLY ON THE THE T. V.
SO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE T. V. AND YOU DON'T NEED A REMOTE CONTROL ACTUALLY SO
BUT IT WILL BE EMBEDDED ON THE T. V. AND NOT ON THE REMOTE CONTROL SO
YEAH L. C. D.
YEAH YEAH YEAH
AND PF WHAT CAN WE THINK A SUPPLEMENT TO
I THINK THE SUPPLEMENT CAN BE THE VOICE
IT IS JUST YOU KNOW IT IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT BUT
IT CAN BE A PART OF
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM
TO PUSH BUTTON YEAH YEAH
EVEN IT IS FOR S JUST SOME KIDS YOU KNOW SWITCHING CHANNELS ONE TWO THREE FOUR
YEAH TURNING YEAH YEAH
NOT VERY COMPLEX COMMANDS BUT EASY COMMANDS SO
YEAH
YEAH SIMPLE ONES FOR
EXPENSIVE BUTTONS YEAH TO MAKE SOME NEW
YEAH
OKAY FRUITS
OKAY
NEED IT TO BE OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SOUNDS GOOD MM-HMM
YEP
YEAH
NO NO NO
YEAH
MM
SO UH FIRST I WILL PRESENT THE CONCEPT OF USER INTERFACE
UM THERE'S THREE CONCEPTS IN THE USER INTERFACE
SO FIRST ONE IT'S A GOOGLE CONTROLLER
THE SECOND IS A FANCY CONTROLLER
THE LAST ONE IS UH INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER
SO THERE ARE THREE CONCEPTS IN OUR CONTROLLER
UM N NEXT I WILL EXPLAIN ONE BY ONE THE FIRST IS GOOGLE CONTROLLER
UM SO I WANT THE CONTROLLER TO BE EASY TO USE BUT WITH SOPHISTICATED FUNCTIONS
SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF EASY TO USE AND UM SOPHISTICATED FUNCTIONS
UH THIS IS A FIRST CONCEPT OF OUR CONTROLLER
THE SECOND CONCEPT IS A FANCY CONTROLLER UM SO WE WANT GIVE THE CUSTOMERS THE IMPRESSION THAT OUR CONTROLLER IS VERY ATTRACTIVE
UM THEY CAN EASY RECOGNISE OUR CONTROLLER AMONG A LOT OF PRODUCTS
SO SO THE U THE USER F THE THE U USER INTERFACE SHOULD BE VERY VERY CUTE VERY VERY G UM
ATTRACTIVE
SUCH LIKE THIS THERE ARE SEVERAL UH EXAMPLES IN THE SLIDES
YEAH IT'S VERY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE
YEAH
IT'S HARD F I IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO REMEMBER IT
OR TO RECOGNISE IT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO THE LAST UH CONCEPT IS INTELLIGENT
WE WANT UH WE WANT OUR CONTROLLER TO BE SMART SO MAYBE WE SHOULD UH USE UM UH
TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND GESTURE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY
SO WE NEED TO HAVE COOP SOME COOPERATION WITH SOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON SPEECH RECOGNITION AND UM GESTURE RECOGNITION
UM
WITH THIS ADVANCED FEATURES WE I THINK WE CAN ATTRACT A LOT OF USER
OKAY
NO
THERE THIS IS THE THREE CONCEPTS OF OUR CONTROLLER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO
Y
UH I THINK SOME TIME IT'S VERY UH CONVENIENT TO USE VOICE INTERFACE AND GESTURE INTERFACE THAN USE BUTTON
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU CANNOT FIND YOUR UH CONTROLLER YOU CAN JUST UH JUST JUST UH SPEAK SOMETHING SUCH AS YEAH ONE TWO
YEAH
SO YOU CAN USE YOUR GESTURE
THAT'S NO PROBLEM
FOR LIMITED VOCABULARY SPEECH RECOGNITION IS VERY RELIABLE AND FOR S LIMITED VOCABULARY GESTURE RECOGNITION IS ALSO VERY
YEAH
YEAH THEY CANNOT SPEAK AT THE SAME TIME
YEAH IT'S VERY INTERESTING
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER
EVEN YOU H YOU HAVE THE CONTROLLER I CAN I CAN SAY CHANNEL THREE SO IT'S C COME TO CHANNEL THREE I DON'T HAVE TO
IT'S ADVANTAGE
HOW MUCH
NO NO WE WE D WE WE JUST ARE USE UM
NO NO WE JUST UM HAVE SOME COOPERATION WITH SOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE WE DON'T HAVE TO DO SOME BASIC RESEARCH ON THIS FIELD
YEAH I THINK IT'S UH BECAUSE UH THIS TECHNOLOGY IS UH
UM FOR LIMITED WOR OR LIMITED WOR UH LEXICAL RECOGNITION IT'S VERY
IT'S UH YEAH
IT'S
NO IT'S UH
EVEN FOR THE F UM BECAUSE THE THE VOCABULARY THE
THE VOCABULARY IS VERY SMALL SO THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THE KEY THE KEY UM THE KEY OF OUR THE KEY FEATURE OF OUR CONTROLLER IS THAT IT'S IT HAS SOME SOME UM ADAPTATION
MECHANISM
IT'S IT'S IT MEANS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SELL THIS CONTROLLER IN CHINA IT'S CAN RECOGNISE CHINESE
IT'S R IF YOU SELL THIS CONTROLLER IN FRANCE IT CAN RECOGNISE FRENCH
YEAH IT'S
BECAUSE OF THIS PRODUCT UH THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED
SO
YEAH
YEAH
OH N YEAH YEAH THA THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO DO LANGUAGE ADAPTATION
YEAH
EVEN FOR EACH F FOR EVEN FOR DIFFERENT FAMILY WE HAVE TO DO D YEAH WE WOULD WE HAVE TO DO ADAPTATION TO
NO IT'S NOT SO COMPLEX
NO NO NO IT'S NOT
I THINK THAT'S N THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR A MICROPHONE
IT IT JUST THE MICROPHONE IS EMBEDDED IN THE CONTROLLER
WHERE IS THE CONTROLLER
IT'S IN YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR HOME
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN YOU CAN EMBED IT UH MICROPHONE HERE
YEAH YEAH JUST YOU JUST PUT THE CONTROLLER HERE THEN YOU
YOU USE YOUR COMMAND AND YOU DO S YOUR GESTURE
NO NO IT'S N Y IF YOU LOSE IT
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK IT WE SHOULD GIVE THE UH FLEXIBILITY TO THE USER AND WE THINK YEAH
YOU CAN SEE THEY CAN SWITCH FORM ONE MODALITY TO ANOTHER
NO THAT'S QUITE INTER QUITE ATTRACTIVE
WELL IF YOU DO LANGUAGE ADAPTATION THERE SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM
WE SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN TECHNOLOGY
MORE FEATURES YEAH
YEAH BUT IF IF YOU STICK TO UM
STICK TO THE FIRST TWO PARTS
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR CONTROLLER WITH OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET
THERE'S NO K FEATURES OF OUR CONTROLLER SO IS THERE IS THERE ANY NECESSARY TO DESIGN NEW CONTROLLER WITHOUT ANY BREAKTHROUGH FEATURES
WOULD Y WOULD YOU REPLACE YOUR CONTROLLER WITH A CONTROLLER WITH SIMILAR FUNCTION IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SOME SOME FUNCTION INSIDE IT THAT
YEAH YOU Y THAT'S A FUN THAT'S NOT THE FUNCTION OF THE CONTROLLER THAT'S A FUNCTION OF T. V.
YOU CAN REPLACE YOUR T. V. WITH A NEW T. V. WITH INTERNET BROWSING FUNCTION BUT
OKAY
BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY THE PROBLEM ONLY THE ISSUE OF CONTROLLER IT'S IT'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF THE T. V.
YEAH BUT WE DO WE DO WE WE WE CANNOT RELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ON THESE FEATURES TO U TO USE THE CONTROLLER
BUT WITH THE FEATURES OF OUR CONTROLLER SUCH AS YOU HAVE THE FEATURE OF VOICE RECOGNITION IN YOUR MOBILE BUT YOU SELDOM USE IT
YOUR MOBILE BUT YOU WHEN YOU CHOOSE A NEW MOBILE YOU CHOOSE THE ONE WITH VOICE RECOGNITION
THAT'S THE FEATURE IS NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELIABLE BUT IT'S A FEATURE TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCT FROM OUR FROM OTHER PRODUCTS
YEAH
YEAH UH
YEAH IF IF IF IF YOU'RE IF YOU AR IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A PRODUCT IT WORKS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RELIABLE WOULD YOU REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER ONE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OH YES BUT THERE'S NO BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER
THE THEN NN NO
THA
BUT THE THERE'S THERE'S N THERE'S N NOT ENOUGH MOTIVATION FOR THEM TO REPLACE THEIR OLD CONTROLLER WITH A NEW ONE IF THERE'S NO KEY FEATURE IN THE NEW CONTROLLER
THAT'S THE SAME YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
IT DID DIDN'T R RECEIVE IT
DIDN'T RECEIVE IT
PARTICIPANT ONE
PARTICIPANT ONE
YEAH MAYBE WE CAN FIRST COME TO
UH TO FRAHAN
WITH FRAHAN THEN YOU CAN PREPARE YOUR SLIDES THEN PRESENT IT LATER
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO YOU GOT EMAIL
MM
LATER
PLA
UH YES
YEAH
YEAH
THE SMART CONTROLLER
OKAY
MM
YEAH
IT'S GOOD
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEP
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
NO Y YOU DO THE MINUTES FIRST OR
NO
OKAY
MM
MM
MM
MM
YEAH BUT HOW HOW IS HOW RISKY IS IT TO TRUST LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION OR GESTURE RECOGNITION
OKAY
OKAY
BUT THIS THIS BUT THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN ANYWAY
YEAH
YEAH BUT THE
YEAH BUT THIS
YEAH
I DON'T THINK IT
OH OKAY OKAY YOU MEAN IT COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF
NO
NO BUT THIS IS DISADVANT DISADVANTAGE
YEAH
UH IF YOU IF IF YOU USE THE BASIC
BUT IT'S IT'S CHANGING HOW THE REMOTE CONTROL IS GONNA BE BUILT
BECAUSE THEN YOU NEED UH
I MEAN THIS DOESN'T HAVE UH THE POWER TO DO RECOGNITION FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH
YEAH THIS COULD BE DOWNLOADED BY THE WEB MAYBE OR
YEAH
MM
YEAH BUT THEN W
YEAH WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE TWELVE EUROS
PROBLEM
OKAY
NO BUT THEN IT'S IT'S LIKE THIS UH
YEAH
BUT YOU WOULD STILL HAVE THE BUTTONS
OR IS IT DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE ONLY VOICE RECOGNITION AND GESTURE RECOGNITION
OR YOU YOU STILL HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO USE BUTTONS
OKAY SO YOU YEAH
YEAH I DUNNO
IT'S A BIT RISKY RISKY
YEAH I DUNNO
WHAT
IF IF
I MEAN UH I'M SURE IF THE USER PAYS THE SAME PRICE HE'S HAPPY TO HAVE RECOGNITION
BUT IF IF IF IT LIKE DOUBLES UH
NO ONE WOULD WOULD BE INTERESTED
YEAH
NO I MEAN
Y
NO BUT YOU NEED YOU NEED NEW REMOTE CONTROLLER THEN
BECAUSE IF YOU WANNA BROWSE INTERNET OR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANNA TYPE SOMETHING OR
NO
NO
CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU WOU YOU WOULD
TRUE
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE THE GOO Y YOU SAY WE WOULD WE WOULD TO HAVE A GOOGLE LIKE CONTROLLER
I DON'T SEE HOW ADDING SPEECH OR GESTURE RECOGNITION WOULD MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL LOOK MORE LIKE GOOGLE
GOOGLE IS IS SIMPLE WORKS FINE
SO I I GUESS IF CAN HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT IS REALLY BASIC SIMPLE AND WORKS FINE IT'S ALREADY A LOT
UH THI THIS
I MEAN THE USER IS NOT ONLY INTERESTED IN HAVING SPEECH OR GESTURE RECOGNITION OR IF HE HAS SOMETHING THAT WORKS FINE AND IS REALLY FANCY
LOOKS NICE AND IT'S EASY EASY TO USE EASY TO USE
SEE
THAT'S THE PROBLEM YEAH
I MEAN I I KNOW IT'S MORE INTERESTING TO DEVELOP A REMOTE CONTROLLER WITH SPEECH AND GESTURE AND WHATEVER
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK THE USER IS THE ONE WHO GONNA BUY THE PRODUCT AND SO
I MEAN THAT'S THE POINT
HMM
YEAH
DUNNO
I DUNNO IF YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY OR
I THINK IT'S MORE INTERESTING WHAT HE SAYS OKAY
YEAH TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SPECIAL FOR
MM-HMM
YEAH
WHAT ABOUT THE TOUCH SCR TOUCH SCREEN
FOR EXAMPLE
IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE I I GUESS
MM
YEAH
OKAY
UH NO TREND WATCHING
THE OTHER ONE
YEAH
UH I THINK SO JUST
YEAH SO JUST TO MEET THE USER REQUIREMENTS I WOULD JUST DO A S SHORT ANAL ANALYSIS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET AND TO KIND OF UM
HAVE A BETTER OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S THE FASHION IN GENERAL I'VE CHECKED MORE THAN ONLY THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET SO NEXT
SO AGAIN IT'S PRETTY MUCH SIMILAR TO WHAT I'VE SAID IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING
UM USER REALLY REALLY WANT A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
THEY'RE NOT SO SO INTERESTED IN UH FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL OKAY
LIKE THE ONE YOU'VE SHOWN DAVID WITH ALL THE BUTTONS AND I MEAN I I IT SOUNDS GOOD TECHNICALLY BUT IT'S IT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT AND UH
SO SECOND POINT IS THEY STILL WANT IT IT TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
SO MAYBE IT'S SORT OF RELATED TO WHAT YOU'VE SAID WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND SO ON
AT THE SAME TIME IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT'S EASY TO USE
SO THAT WERE THE THREE FIRST POINTS FROM THE REMOTE CONTROL UH ANALYSIS
NOW I IF WE LOOK AT FASHION IN GENERAL UM
OKAY
WHA WHAT WE REALLY SEE THIS YEAR IS THAT UH EVERYTHING FROM CLOTHES TO SHOES AND FURNITURE IS IS INSPIRED BY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
OKAY SO I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE DESIGN OF THE THE THING
'CAUSE IT'S IT'S REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT
EVEN IF IT'S IN GENERAL FASHION WE WANT IT TO BE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEN UH IF IF WE TAKE THE ORDERING OR THE RANKING OF ALL THE POINTS
FANCY LOOK AND FEEL HAS ON A SCORE OF SEVEN WOULD HAVE SIX AS IMPORTANCE
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE IT'S THREE
THEN EASY TO USE UH IT'S NOT SO IMPORTANT ACTUALLY WITH RESPECT TO OTHER Y OTHER ONES
SO WE SEE FANCY LOOK AN LOOK AND FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE AND THEN IF WE COMBINE THIS WITH THE FASHION UH FROM MILAN AND PARIS
WE GO TO THE FRUITS AND VEDE VEGETABLES
AND THE OTHER POINT I HAVEN'T MENTION IS PEOPLE WAN WANT TO HAVE A SPONGY TOUCH OKAY SO THIS IS THIS MAYBE DOESN'T REALLY FIT WITH THE WOODEN DESIGN
I DUNNO
YEAH THI THIS IS THIS WOULD BE LIKE UM
PLASTIC LIKE BUT RUBBER MAYB MAYBE YOU KNOW RUBBER LIKE UH
DEVICE SO UM
OKAY THA THA THAT WAS THE MAIN POINT I THINK FROM THE TREND
IN FASHION
YEAH SO WHEN I THINK IT'S
MM-HMM
MAYBE NOT NO WOOD BUT I MEAN MA MAYBE NOT THE PART YOU TOUCHING YOU KNOW
YEAH MAYBE THE BASE
BUT STILL Y
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN IT'S NOT EXACTLY RIGHT FOR THE SPONGY POINT OF VIEW
BUT WE COULD MAYBE HAVE BOTH LIKE PART OF WOOD AND SOME RUBBER FOR THE BUTTONS OR I DUNNO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH D
I DUNNO
WHAT INTERFACE
YEAH NO NOT FORGETTING ABOUT THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TRENDS
IF POSSIBLE
HMM
OKAY
YOUR JUDGEMENT IT'S IS BIASED
SO WE ARE SO
LET'S GO FOR OUR DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
SO I WILL STILL PLAY THE ROLE OF THE SECRETARY AND WE'LL HAVE UM FIRST THE PROJECT PRESENTATION BY OUR USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
DAVID JORDAN AND OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER BABA
SO WE'LL HAVE TO EVALUATE THE UH YOUR PROPOSED REMOTE CONTROL AND UM HAVE AN IDEA OF THE PRICE THAT UH THIS THING WILL COST
AND IN CASE IF WE'RE WE ALL AGREE ON THE FABRICA OF UM BUILDING OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL WE'LL EVALUATE THE UM PRODUCTION
SO MAYBE I WILL LET THE OUR TWO DESIGNERS TALK ABOUT SO THEIR YOU HAVE S OH SORRY
OOPS
LOOKS STRANGE
OKAY
GENETICALLY MODIFIED MUSHROOM I WILL SAY BUT KEEP ON SPEAKING
OH
MAYBE I HOPE SO
CHAN
YEAH OKAY BUT DON'T TOUCH DON'T DESTROY YOUR PROTOTYPE
EVERYTHING'S MUSHROOM
SO WE CAN CALL OUR REMOTE CONTROL THE MUSHROOM
OKAY
OH
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
VEGETABLES
MUSHROOM IS A VEGETABLE
IT'S VEGETABLE
SO TH IT'S SOMETHING EATABLE
NEXT SLIDE
MM-HMM
IN THE BASE
IN THE BASEMENT
IN THE BASEMENT
AND WHERE IS THE SOLAR SOLAR CELL
WHERE IS THE SOLAR CELL
OH
DO YOU THINK IT WON'T BE IT WON'T CRIS INCREASE THE PRICE
OKAY WE'LL SEE AFTER
WE WILL HAVE FIRST TO SO MISTER MONEY WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ACCORDING TO THIS REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
MAYBE IF YOU CHANGE IF YOU TAKE THE BUTTONS OUT AND MAYBE DO THINGS LIKE THAT
IT WOULD BE BET MORE LIKE A LEMON
YEAH
LOOKS LIKE MORE FRUIT
MAYBE A PINEAPPLE
AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE
FINGER HERE WITH THE BUTTONS
IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A PINEAPPLE
SORRY
WHAT'S THE USE FOR THAT
AND WHERE IS THE VOICE RECOGNITION
OKAY
OKAY
IS IT BETTER LIKE THAT
LOOKS OKAY LET'S SAY IT'S A PINEAPPLE NOW
IT LOOKS LIKE A NOW YOU TOOK IT
IT LOOKS LIKE A PINEAPPLE WITH CHERRY ON TOP
MM UH
SEVEN IS THE MA THE MAXIMUM
THREE I WILL SAY THREE
ISN'T IT BITTER LIKE THAT
FEASIBLE
YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT YOU THERE'S UM MICROPHONE INSIDE AN
OH
OKAY AND YOU HAVE THE THERE'S THE TECHNOLOGY INSIDE THAT RECOGNISE SIMPLE VOCAL COMMENTS
AND YOU CAN TURN IT SO MAYBE IT'S TECHNO TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOV INNOVATIVE
WE HAVE TACTILE BUTTONS
OH YEAH
MAYBE TWO
TWO
I WOULD SAY TWO
YOU AGREE
IT'S BETTER LIKE THAT ISN'T IT
OKAY
OH OK I UNDERSTAND
YOU TAKE TAKE THE REMOTE SO AND YOU CAN TURN LIKE THAT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL
I THINK IT'S QUITE EASY TO SO S ZAPPING BUT MAYBE IT WILL BE TOO FAST
YEAH YOU HAVE A LIKE THAT AND SO ON
OH YEAH
YEAH BUT Y BUT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS IF YOU WANT TO GO
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU'RE ZAPPING YOU'RE CHANGING FROM ONE CHANNEL TO THE OTHER SO YOU'RE PASSING THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS
SO WHEN YOU SAY I WANT TO GO TO THE CHANNEL NUMBER TWENTY THAT'S YOU'VE DECIDED TO GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY
SO YOU CAN SAY CHANNEL TWENTY OR CHANNEL FOUR BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT TO GO ON THIS CHANNEL
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TO DO ZAPPING YOU YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO YOU CAN TURN IT
JUST GO THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS AND MAYBE STOP IF THERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING
SEEMS TO BE GOOD
GOOD CHOICE MISTER DAVID JORDAN
YEAH WHAT'S WHAT'S THIS CHERRY
OKAY
YEAH TH YOU HAVE THE VOCAL COMMANDS
ON OFF
MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE THE YEAH IT'S A SLEEPING REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S TRUE
W THAT WHY WE HAVE THE SOLAR TI YEAH
SO THREE
DO YOU AGREE
THREE
AND WHAT'S YOUR OPINION
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY
PREVIOUSLY YOU SAID THAT TURNING THIS WAS THE FINE
FINE TO COARSE
AND FROM TEN TO TEN CHANNELS HERE
OKAY
OH
YEAH NO NO NO
YOU CAN'T PUT IT OUT
IT'S JUST YOUR TURNING FROM THE BASE
YOU NEED TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN HAND
IF YOU WANT TO TURN YOU CAN'T USE IT AND TURN
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
YOU NEED TO PUT IT ON AND TURN
YEAH BUT NOBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE IT IN THE POCKET AND BRING IT IN THE KITCHEN AND SAY I'VE LOST THE REMOTE CONTROL
NOBODY WOULD TAKE IT
SO NOBODY W WILL LOST LOSE IT
S MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE FROM TH
FOUR
EASY TO USE FOUR
GONNA SAY FOUR
TROIS
THREE
SO TH THE PROJECT IS ACCEPTED
BUT I D M I THINK THAT IT WILL BE GOOD TO DO SOME MORE WORK TO TRANSFORM THIS INTO A PINEAPPLE
IF YOU RE WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE A FRUITFUL REMOTE CONTROL
SO UH MM MM
MM
OKAY AND WE WE HAD A PROJECT PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION WITH THE
EVALUATION
SO AS WE ALL AGREE TO ACCEPT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE PROTOTYPE WE'LL HAVE LOOK TO THE FINAL SH FINANCIAL VIEW
SO WE NEED TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COST
AS I SAID IN THE FIRST MEETING WE NEED TO HAVE SO A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WOULD COST NOT MORE THAN TWELVE AND POINT FIFTY EUROS
AND IF NOT IF IT'S NOT THE CASE Y YOU WOULD HAVE TO REDESIGN IT
SO JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE OKAY HERE IS THE
EXCEL
SHEET SO SO IT HAS THE ENERGY SOURCE
WE HAVE HAND DYNAMO
NO WE DON'T USE THAT
WE HAVE BATTERY RIGHT
KINETIC WE DON'T HAVE IT I SUPPOSE BUT WE HAVE SOLAR CELLS
UM HOW MANY DO Y DO YOU NEED SOLAR CELLS
DO YOU THINK ONE WOULD BE ENOUGH OR SUCH AS
AS NUMBER OF BRANCHES
THREE
SO ELECTRONIC
SINGLE SIMPLE CHIP ON PRINT
JUST ONE WOULD BE NECESSARY
ONE
ZERO FOR THE OTHERS
AND SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER
ONE
AS WE HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION I THINK
SO THE CASE
OKAY JUST KEEP ON GOING JUST TO HAVE AN IDEA
WELL UH YEAH BUT WHAT WHAT ABOUT CASE
UNCURVED FLAT SINGLE CURVED DOUBLE CURVED
I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE DOUBLE CURVED
ONE
UH WOOD
UH DO WE NEED SPECIAL COLOUR
Y MAYBE TWO
WE HAVE TWO SPECIAL COLOURS
PUSH BUTTON
OKAY
SCROLL WHEEL
WE DON NO
IT IT'S MORE LIKE INTEGRATED SCOR
YEAH MAYBE TWO SCROLL WHEEL AS WE HAVE THE COARSE COARSE TO FINE SCROLL WHEEL
SO NO BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
OKAY
OKAY WE I THINK WE HAVE PROBLEM
I THINK WE S IF WE KEEP ON ADDING THINGS SO WE HAVE TO
MAYBE IF W T IF SUPPOSE IF WE CHANGE AND WE G PUT JUST ONE
HAS IT CHANGED
OKAY
YEAH BUT WE HAVE YOU THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION NO
OKAY
OR IT WOULD BE BETTER
SO DO WE NEED SPECIAL COLOUR
BECAUSE WE HAVE RED
RED AND YELLOW
I THINK SO WE NEED IF WE TRY TO HAVE A KIND OF
PINEAPPLE BEE
YEAH
AN BUT WE HAVE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL WITH PUSH DUT BUTTON
AND I THINK THIS IS ONE
INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON
SO WE'LL WE HAVE ONLY ONE
AND PUSH BUTTON
SO IF WE HAVE ALL INTEGRATED I IN THE SCROLL WHEEL AND PUSH BUTTON IT'S UH
SOMETHING FLAT
S UNCURVED
YEAH MAYBE NOT
YEAH
MM
NEARLY
MAYBE DON'T BAT NO BATTERY ONLY SOLAR CELLS
I THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE PUSH PUSH BUTTON
WE ONLY NEED MAYBE JUST ONE
JUST ONE
YEAH
SO YEAH YOU WILL HAVE SO ONE BUTTON AND S
SCROLL WHEEL WITH PUSH BUTTON ON IT
SO
SO YEAH
IT THINK WE WE'VE DONE GOOD JOB AS THE COST IS
TWELVE FIFTY E
YEAH BUT IT'S UNDER OR EQUAL
IT'S NOT WRITTEN
SOMETIMES IT'S UNDER OR EQUAL
TWELVE FIFTY
YEAH I THINK
I THINK YEAH
BUT IT WOULD I BE INTERESTING FOR OUR MARKETING TEAM TO MAKE A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT CONCERNING THESE SOLAR CELLS TO BE
YEAH BUT IT WILL BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVA INNOVATIVE SO
SO IT'S EASY TO USE AND POWERFUL AS THE REMOTE CONTROL A HAS ONLY ONE BUTTON
EASY POWERFUL
SO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO REDESIGN THE P THE PRODUCT
YEAH
SO
NOW
SO
SO DID YOU ENJOY YOUR CLAY MODELLING
YEAH
WAS IT A NICE WAY TO CREATE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
AND FOR THE MARKETING GUY
AND NEW IDEAS ABOUT NEW PRODUCTS MAYBE WI WHICH WOULD BE FASHION AND UH
AND YELLOW
YES JUST LEMON
SQUARED
AH THE LEMON T. V. WITH THE PINEAPPLE REMOTE CONTROL
OH THAT'S INTERESTING
YOU COULD F WE COULD DO A KIND OF FRUIT COLLECTION OF ELECTRONICS THINGS
ELECTRONIC DEVICE
MAYBE
YEAH MAYBE LA NEXT YEAR IT WILL BE INSECTS
CUSTOMABLE T. V.
AH SUCH YEAH
YOU'VE ALREADY SAID MOBILE PHONES
YEAH AND FOLLOWING
MM
IT'S INTERESTING MAYBE WE CAN CREATE A A LINE OF UH T. V. WITH UH A A TR
SO I THINK THE COSTS ARE WITHIN THE BUDGET
WE'RE JUST AT TWELVE FIFTY EUROS
SO DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CELEBRATE YOUR CREATION
OH THANKS A LOT
THANK YOU MISTER DAVID JORDAN
THE THING NOW IS TO TO SELL IT
IT'S MAYBE A LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE
MAYBE WHAT YOU CAN DO A TEST
PUT IT OUTSIDE AND IF BEES COME IT'S REALLY FRUIT
BUT DON'T PUT SUGAR IN IT IT'S NOT WORKING
YEAH BUT THE COLOUR I THINK THE COLOUR IS MORE IS MOST IMPORTANT
BECAUSE I I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE EVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH BUT WE DECIDED TO HAVE SOMETHING YELLOW AND RED FOR THE COSTS
SO MAYBE WE CAN JUST INTEGRATE IT ON TH ON ONE SIDE THE DOUBLE R.
SO WE HAVE THE LOGO WE HAVE THE COLOUR AND WE HAVE THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO WE HAVE THE SLOGAN TOO
YEAH TH NO IT'S THE IT'S THE PINEAPPLE CONTROL REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S A PINEAPPLE NOW IT HAS CHANGED
IT'S A PINEAPPLE
PINEAPPLE
WITH CHERRY ON TOP
WILL YOU BUY ONE
TRY TO
OKAY UH
ONE THING I LIKE IS THE SHAPE
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE THE UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR POCKET ON UH IN YOUR JACKET
I PREFER THE LASER REMOTE CONTROL
NO
OH
MAYBE NEXT IF WE DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING WE'D CAN PUT LIGHT INSIDE
YEAH
I THINK IT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO JUST TO SEE IF WE CAN IF PEOPLE WILL BUY THIS ONE AND MAYBE ADD SOME FEATURES TO IT AFTER YEAH
SO
CHAMPAGNE MISTER BABA
SO
OKAY I WILL CLOSE THIS
MM
SO I THINK WE HAVE FINISHED THE DESIGNING AND THE EVALUATION OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL
AND WE HAVE A NEARLY FINAL PRODUCT
FINAL PROTOTYPE RIGHT
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
VERY PRODUCTIVE
MM-HMM
SO READY
SORRY I I UM I'M AFRAID
UH THI THIS REMOTE CONTROL WILL STAY A PROTOTYPE
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
EFFECTIVELY ONE SLIDE AND MAYBE WE CAN DISCUSS EVERYTHING
OKAY
YEAH
UH
YEAH YEAH I'M SURE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT LIKE REALLY MUSHROOM BECAUSE YOU HAVE UH YOU KNOW UH LIKE LEMON SHAPE YOU KNOW CENTRE IS YELLOW AND T D
TO INTEGRATE YOU KNOW YEAH
I DON'T THINK I HOPE NOBODY WILL EAT IT
YOU KNOW TO INTEGRATE THE FRUIT ASPECT YOU KNOW THE THE IN
REALLY
BUT
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SO MUSHROOM WAS A KIND OF YOU KNOW UH
MUSHROOM
OH UH I'M NOT SURE
WE CAN IT'S A VEG A KIND OF VEGETABLE BUT YOU KNOW WE WE INTEGRATED THEM WITH DIFFERENT COLOUR
I I THINK WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE YOU KNOW
THIS YOU KNOW VERY ENLIGHTED COLOURS YOU KNOW
AND INSPIRED COLOUR AND AND VERY SOPHISTICATED MATERIAL SO
AND SO
SO WHAT WE W WHAT I CAN ADD IS THAT YOU KNOW HE TALK ABOUT WHAT IS OUTSIDE
SO WHAT IS INSIDE IS WHAT WE DIS WHAT WE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE CHIP IT IS A LOW LEVEL CHIP AND
YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO K
YOU KNOW WI THE LOW LEVEL CHIPS INSIDE AND YOU KNOW THE L. C. D. BUTTON AND THE I
THE BATTERY IT IS UNDER
IT IS IN TH IN IN THE BASE YEAH
IN FACT THIS THIS THIS THIS IS A KIND OF YOU KNOW REVOLUTIONARY SOLAR RECEPTOR THAT WE CAN PUT OUTSIDE AND I DON'T THINK SO
BUT IT IT'S MIGHT BE OKAY SO
I IT MIGHT BE OKAY
SO
YEAH
SO FOUR POINT THREE POINT FIVE IT MEANS IT'S ACCEPTABLE
OOPS
I THINK YOU HAVE NICE COLOURS
I DON'T THE SHA THE BOWL SHAPE PEOPLE LIKE
IS IT REALLY FANCY
BUT IT'S YOU HAVE THE LEMON ASPECT OF THIS TH THIS THIS THING
DO DON'T DO THAT PLEASE
I IT'S IT'S I THIS SHAPE IS A LEMON LIKE SO
YEAH
BECAUSE I
LESS BUTTON
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTON NOW
THAT'S UH YEAH IS THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
SO THAT'S GREAT
THAT'S GREAT
I HAVE NO IDEA SO
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
IF IT IS FANCY OR NOT
SO WE CAN WE CAN SAY T
THE COLOUR IS THE COLOUR ACCEPTABLE
SO THE SHAPE NOW
IT'S TOO MUCH RED
IN THE BASEMENT
I WILL GIVE I WILL
I'LL GI
I'LL GIVE TWO OR THREE
THREE IT'S OKAY
THREE THREE
THREE IS FINE FOR ME
WHAT OTHER
IS IT EASY TO USE
YE UH
EMBEDDED
IT'S A MICRO ARRAY OKAY
OH YEAH YEAH
AND I THINK YOU YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A ROU A ROUND REMOTE CONTROL SO IT IS
I
W YEAH BUT
I SEE YOU HAVE MICROPHONE ARRAY EMBEDDED
YOU HAVE THAT'S GOOD
AND YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THIS KI THIS SOLAR RECEPTOR THAT YOU KNOW YES
YEAH
I THINK TECHNICALLY IT'S ACCEPTABLE SO
YEAH
TWO YEAH TWO
IT'S IT'S FINE SO
MOST
EH FOR TH THE VOCAL COMMAND YES IT'S MIGHT BE EASY
BUT IT'S JUST SPEAKING
YOU JUST NEED THE COMMAND
AS A PRINCIPLE
I THINK MAYBE IF YOU HE
IF YOU HEAR SOME CLICK
YEAH IT WOULD
OH YEAH THAT'S DIFFICULT
THAT'S DIF THAT'S DIFFICULT
YEAH BUT Y HOW YOU NEED TO KNOW I
I THINK SOMETHING THAT YEAH
AND YOU YOU CAN
I THINK YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE A SCALE SO
YEAH IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT
I THINK B BUT THE THE VOCAL COMMAND IS EASY TOO
YOU CAN SAY FIFTY AND FIFTY IT'S OKAY SO
UH YEAH AND Y THAT'S YEAH
YEAH
TO SEE UH YEAH UH
YEAH
AND BUT I'D
IT IS A TURN OFF T TURN OFF BUTTON MAYBE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
THAT'S
THAT'S VERY TECHNOLOGIC SO
YEAH
S BUT I DI I DIDN'T SEE WHERE THE T F THE TURN OFF T TURN ON TURN OFF BUTTON SO MUCH ACTIVATES MAYBE ONE OF THE
UH IT'S K ON OFF YEAH
YEAH SLEEPING
TO COMPENSATE
YEAH
EASY TO USE IT'S VERY RELATIVE BUT THREE IT'S FINE I THINK IT'S REASONABLE THREE
THREE F THREE FOR ME IT'S O IT'S OKAY
FOUR OR THREE
MAYBE YOU CAN VOTE TO SEE HOW MANY EVERYBODY GIVES AND NO AND JUST TAKE THE MEAN
WILL YOU GIVE
FOUR
FIVE
YEAH SO MAYBE IF
YEAH BUT Y YOU KNOW
YOU JUST PUSH TWO BUTTON ZERO AND AND ONE
AND THAT'S
ARE THERE SOME BUTTONS
OKAY
IN FACT ON A FLAT PLACE
YOU CAN
OH YE YES THAT'S RIGHT
OH MY GOD
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE MAY IT'S THE NEXT PROTOTYPE MAYBE WE COU
FOUR
MAYBE FOUR IT'S OKAY
I'LL PUT FOUR
YEAH FOUR IT'S MORE REASONABLE
YOU CAN YOU CAN ERASE WITH THIS ER YEAH
YEAH FOUR IT'S MORE REASONABLE SO
SO IT'S NINE NINE OVER THREE
OH YEAH IT'S
IT NEED MAYBE SOME WO FURTHER WORK BUT IT'S
YEAH UH S YEAH
MIGHT IT MIGHT BE FINE
YEAH B I THINK
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S THE FINANCE
YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH WE HAVE BATTERY
NO UM SOLAR CELLS YEAH
UH I THINK IN EACH BALL YOU HAVE THREE THREE UH YEAH THREE YEAH
THREE THREE SOLAR CELLS
S S SIMPLE SIMPLE YEAH
YEAH
MM
ONE MAYBE YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
IS IT
IS SH IT
WOODEN
IS YES A WOODEN PL I AND THAT'S THERE'S NO WOOD SO PLASTIC JUST ONLY I THINK
DOUBLE CURVE YEAH DOUBLE CURVE
ONE YOU HAVE
BUT IT'S YEAH A A RUBBER UH
YEAH YEAH
Y Y YEAH YEAH
FIVE
I THINK THAT THIS WILL BE LIKE A SCROLL WHEEL ACTUALLY
Y YOU TU YOU TURN YOU TURN IT SO
YEAH TRUE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY YEAH YEAH
SCR
L. C. DISPLAY MAYBE
INTERFACE
IT'S OKAY
FINE
YEAH IT WAS STAGE ONE SO
SO
I THINK YOU CAN TRANSFORM THE WOOD INTO PLASTIC MAYBE
BECAUSE UH IT SEEMS THAT THIS CAN BE YEAH WOOD INTO PLASTIC AND IT IT SHOULD BE FINE
YEAH RED AND YELLOW
FANCY
ONE
I CAN REMOVE MAYBE F YOU HAVE FIVE WITH PUSH BUTTONS SO WE CAN JUST I DUNNO TRY TO MODIFY SOME OF THEM TO HAVE YEAH
DOUBLE CURVE
WE CAN TRANSFORM THE DOUBLE CURVE INTO SINGLE C YEAH
F SOME
SINGLE CURVE
SINGLE CURVE SHOULD BE FINE SO
OH WHAT
IT'S IT'S A BAD IDEA SO
TWO
ONE
THAT'S FINE
THAT'S FINE
ONE S ONE SCROLL WHEEL SO AND THE VOCAL CHORD IT'S FINE
IT I TH IT'S FINE
IT'S FINE
IT'S UNDER OR EQUAL
IT'S FINE SO
IT'S FINE TWELVE FIFTY UH
THE SOLAR CELLS R IS I IS IT
YEAH TO BE ABLE TO SI TO SELL IT
YEAH WITH MI
IT'S IT IS REALLY REALLY UH REALLY VERY VERY EXPENSIVE THOUGH
MAYBE IF UH OKAY
YEAH YEAH
IT'S EASY TO USE
IT'S VERY EASY TO USE
NO
WE'VE DONE IT WITH IT IS UNDER THE IF IT WAS LOW HIGH OR SO
SO
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THIS PROJECT EVALUATION
OKAY OKAY IT'S FINE
YEAH I THINK I FIND IT REALLY FUNNY AND AMAZING AND INTERESTING TO GO THROUGH ALL THE PROCESS TO FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END
AND DESIGNING LOOKING AT THE CHIPS THE SOLAR CELLS AND UH AND IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE FOR
YEP
OKAY OKAY
YELLOW
I THINK YOU CAN THINK ABOUT A YELLOW T. V. NOW AFTER A FRUIT T. V. OR I DUNNO
IT CAN BE AN INTERESTING I DON'T KNOW
YEAH JUST A LEMON T. V. IT'D BE YELLOW LEMON
IT'S FLAT UH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
IT'S REALLY BORING YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THAT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING ACTUALLY
DEVICE DEVI
THE FRUIT
YEAH
YEAH IT'S
BUT I THINK IT'S GOOD TO FOLLOW THE F FLOW AND YOU KNOW MAKE IT NOW AND AFTER
YOU KNOW IF THE PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MIND YOU CHANGE ALSO THE PRODUCT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S A YEAH YEAH
WE CAN THINK ABOUT T. V. WITH YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE YOU KNOW THE ASPECTS O LIKE FOR THE CELL PHONES YOU KNOW
YEAH YOU CUSTOMISE IT EVERY TI SO EVERY TI IF PEOPLE CHANGE YOU JUST CHANGE THE APPEARANCE AND Y Y YOU CAN KEEP
YEAH YOU CAN KEEP THE GLOBAL APPEARAN
THE MOOD OF PERSONS THE FASHIONS UH
WE INT
YEAH T. V. YEAH
A T. V. FOR AUTUMN AND A T. V. FOR WINTER YOU KNOW SO IT'S
SO WHAT I AND DO W IS IT OKAY
YEAH THE PR AT
YEAH BUT I THINK F IT'S REALLY A CELEBRATING OBJECT
SO IT'S YELLOW AND VERY A VERY HA IT'S VERY HAPPY SO

I I THINK I LIKE THE THE COLOUR A THE COLOUR ARE VERY GOOD SO ACTUALLY SO
IT'S PERFECT AND
I P IS TH Y THE THE YELLOW BALL THING THAT
UH F LIKE Y WE CAN WE CAN PUT SOME UH DOUBLE R.
OKAY YEAH YEAH
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD IDEA SO
IT'S NOT A MUSHROOM
IT'S A PINEAPPLE REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH PINEAPPLE REMOTE REMOTE CONTROL
OH THAT
OH UNID UH UNIDENTIFIED REMOTE CONTROL SO
THAT'S THAT'S PINEAPPLE REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK IT'S FINE
YEAH
YEAH I WILL TRY I'LL TRY
I CAN HEL I WILL TRY VERSIONS SO TO SEE HOW EASY EASY TO MANAGE
YEAH I ALWAYS LOSE MY YEAH SO SO I IF IT IS A UNIVERSAL ONE I CAN USE IT WITH MY T. V. SO IT WOULD BE
I THINK I WOULD CHOOSE THIS ONE BECAUSE OF THE COLOUR
IT'S
IT'S WILL ENLIGHT YOUR HOUSE YOUR HOME AND YOUR T. V. SO
YEAH
YEAH YEAH THAT WOULD BE UH AN IDEA
YEAH THAT'S THAT FINE
SO WE CAN CELEBRATE NOW
THAT'S OUR NEW PRODUCT
YES
IT'S IT'S FINE
IT'S
I LIKE IT
NEXT TIME
WELL I'LL BUY ONE HERE
YEAH
NO
OKAY
OKAY
FINAL PROTOTYPE YEAH YE YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
S SO WHO IS GOING TO TAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL
'KAY
IT'S PERFECT
WHERE
IT'S HERE
OKAY
YEAH
'KAY
I HAVE SLIDES
AH THAT IS THREE
PRODUCT PROD
YEP
OKAY
OKAY
SO THIS IS OUR PRODUCT OR PROTOTYPE
THIS IS MADE BY CLAY
YEAH
UH THE BASIC COLOUR IS UH YELLOW AND RED
YELLOW IS UH OUR COMPANY COLOUR UH RED IT'S UH IS MORE ATTRACTIVE
SO WE USED TWO BASIC COLOUR YELLOW AND RED
AND THE SHAPE THERE'S TWO BASIC SHAPE
THE FIRST IS A CIRCLE AND THE SECOND IS A TRIANGLE S PIECE
IT'S WE CALL IT A MUSHROOM DESIGN
IT'S LOOKS LIKE SOME MUSHROOM SO WE CALL IT MUSHROOM DESIGN
SO THIS IS A INTRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCT
NEXT A MO
OKAY YEAH SO NEXT SLIDE
SO THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY FEATURES OF OUR PR PROTOTYPE
THE FIRST IS THAT IT IS FUZZY
I'M SURE THIS WOULD BE THE UNIQUE DESIGN THE MARKET
YEAH SO IT'S A FUZZY DESIGN AND A UNIQUE DESIGN
UM AND UH
THE SECOND KEY FEATURE IS THAT UH S CIRCLE CHANNEL UM SELECTION
IN THE TRADITIONAL KEY UH TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER USE BUTTON TO TO SELECT THE CHANNEL BUT NOW WE HAVE A S CIRCLE
SO WE CAN TURN THIS BALL TO T TO SELECT CHANNEL
SO IT'S QUITE CONVENIENT FOR USER TO USE IT
YEAH S OKAY
UH THE THIRD FEATURE IS A STABLE TRIANGLE BASE
UH THIS STA UH THIS TRIANGLE BASE IS VERY STABLE SO
UH SO IT'S IT'S UM IT'S UNLIKELY YOU CANNOT FOUND IT
SO IT'S V UM YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE TABLE SO YOU CAN TURN THE THE BALL TO CHA TO SELECT THE CHANNEL
AND THERE'S SOME CUTE BUTTON
YOU C CAN CAN YOU CAN SEE THE THE SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS N IS A MUSHROOM SO
YEAH EVERYTHING'S MUSHROOM
MUSH
MUSHROOM DESIGN YEAH
YEAH
YEAH TH THAT'S WHY IF YOU PUT IT IN THE TABLE BE CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL EAT IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH NO THIS OUR ONLY TWO SLIDES
YEAH
SO WE CUT IT TO SEE
OKAY
SO WHERE'S THE BATTERY BATTERY
BASE
HERE
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH THE SHAPE IS UNIQUE AND THE COLOUR
SO IT DEPEND ON HOW D DO YOU DEFINE FANCY
UH
SO MY MUSH
MM
YEAH
HMM
UH FOR TURN TURN THE BALL
IF YOU WANT TO TURN THE BALL IT'S VERY IT'S VERY CONVENIENT FOR YOU TO TO TO TURN THE BALL TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL
UH
AH IT'S EMBEDDED YOUR MICROPHONE
TH THIS TH TH THERE'S TWO TWO FUNCTIONS
THIS IS MICROPHONE ARRAY
OKAY
'KAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH THIS IS MICROPHONE ARRAY IN FACT
THERE FOUR MICROPHONE
SO THEY THEY THEY THEY THERE'S A MICROPHONE ARRAY
YEAH YEAH
SO YOU CAN CAPTURE VOICE YEAH YOU C
YEAH SO YOU CAN CAPTURE S VOICE FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
YEAH
YEAH I AGREE
YEAH IT'S VERY EASY
YOU CAN USE THIS IN THIS WAY
YEAH
TH THIS IS THE BASE
SO YOU CAN TURN TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL
YOU JUST TU TURN D D
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO NO NO
I IF Y UH IF IT DEPEND ON THE THE ANGLE YOU TURN THE
I IF IF THIS IS A CHANNEL ONE
SO IT C IT COULD BE CHANNEL TWO CHANNEL THREE CHANNEL FOUR CHANNEL FIVE
SO CHANGE
YEAH
Y UH FIFTH CHANNEL DIVIDED BY THE NUM BY THE BY THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN DEGREE
SO YOU GOT HOW MANY DEGREE YOU YOU IT
NO NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO Y NO IT'S UH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU STOP T UH WHEN YOU STOP THE
THE TURN
THEN THE ANGLE YOU STOP IS THE ANGLE YOU IS THE CHANNEL YOU
IT'S IT'S VERY EASY BECAUSE YOU KN YOU KNOW HOW MANY CHANNEL ARE THERE IN THE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YOU CAN DO IT
I THINK SO I THINK SO YOU CAN DO IT
I THINK SO YOU CAN JUST CHANGE
THERE'S UH ALSO A NUMBER YOU KNOW
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND ALSO YOU CAN IF YOU I
YOU CA YOU CAN TURN THIS
OR YOU CA YOU CAN YOU CAN ALSO TURN THIS
FOR THIS YOU CAN TUNE IT'S FOR TUNE
YOU YOU IF YOU WANT TO SKIP FROM CHANNEL ONE TO CHANNEL TWO YOU YOU SKIP THIS
IF YOU WANT TO FROM UH SKIP FROM CHANNEL ONE TO CHANNEL TEN YOU TUNE THIS
IT'S LIKE FINE FROM COARSE TO FINE
THIS IS COARSE THIS IS FINE
SO IT'S COARSE TO FINE DESIGN
YEAH
YEAH IS IS THIS IS FROM ONE CHANNEL TO MAYBE TO TEN CHANNEL
THIS IS FROM ONE CHANNEL TO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH AGREE AGREE
UH W W WHAT DO Y WHAT UH YOU COMPARE WITH TRADITIONAL UH UM TR TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER
I THINK IT'S EASIER THAN TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER
IF YOU USE TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER YOU HAVE TO PUT A BUTTON BUT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT BUTTON YOU HAVE YOU JUST TURN THE TURN THE BALL
THERE'S TWO KIND OF BALLS THE SMALLER THE THE THE SO YOU CAN C YOU CAN C YOU CAN CONTROL THE SCALE
BUT IN THE TRADITIONAL CONTROLLER HOW DO HOW CAN YOU CONTROL THE SCALE
YEAH YEAH YEAH Y YOU YOU CAN DO IT
BUT YOU CAN ALSO DO IT IN THE B IF YOU YOU DO NOT WA IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BROWSING ALL THE CHANNEL YOU CAN JUST P THERE'S ALSO A BUTTON HERE
YEAH THIS FUNCTION IS JUST FOR YOUR BROWSING FROM ONE CHANNEL TO TH THE NEXT ONE THE NEXT S SN S THE TH THE THIRD ONE
YEAH YEAH
Y ONE TO TEN TEN TO TWELVE UH TEN TO T UH TWENTY
TEN TO TWENTY AND THIS ONE T ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX LIKE THIS
UH THERE'S DIFFERENT SCALE SO YOU CAN YOU CAN CHOOSE HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO SC
MM-HMM
I I THIS IS JUST A BASE
YOU CAN JUST
YEAH
YOU USE YOUR Y
SO TH THIS IS A D NEXT GENERATION CONTROLLER
YEAH
OKAY OKAY OKAY
FOUR
OKAY
OKAY
THREE
TROIS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
THE SOLAR CELL IS TOO EXPENSIVE
MM
YEAH WE HAVE FOUR
FIVE
NO
NO NO
NO NO NO IT
OKAY
NO
WE HAVE CHANGE THE ELECTRONICS TO FROM FROM THE THE THE SAMPLE SENSOR TO REGULAR CHIP
OH
WE HAVE TO DELETE THE THE SAMPLE SENSOR I THINK
YEAH IT'S THE ONE IT'S M MAYBE WE HA WE HAVE TWO VERSIONS THE FIRST VERSION THE BASIC VERSION
ADVANCED VERSION WE HAVE SPEAK
PLASTIC IS FREE
WAIT
WE WE CAN WE CAN WE C YELLOW
HOW ABOUT WE CHANGE THE SALE
AH WE HAVE ONE
OKAY
OKAY
AGREE
COU COULD WE HAVE LOOK
COULD WE HAVE LOOK AT THE P THE THE PROD THE P THE COST
OKAY
SO LET'S SAY
WHA WHAT YEAH
WHICH PART IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART
YEAH I THINK IT'S NOT T T
CHEAPER
OKAY
YES
OF COURSE
THIS IS MY JOB
YEAH IT'S UH
IT'S GOOD TO
TO CREATE A CONTROL INSTEAD OF A COMPUTER
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH BUT Y YOU KNOW THE TRADITIONAL T. V. IT'S UM
YEAH YEAH IT'S FLAT YEAH THE SHAPE IS VERY BORING
COULD WE COME UP WITH NEW T. V. WITH SUCH AS THIS KIND OF T. V.
SO YOU CAN YOU HAVE BASE TRIANGLE BASE SO YOU THE T. V. YOU CAN
YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE THE T. V. YOU ALSO
YEAH
YEAH
MM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
AND YOU CAN CELEBRATE YOUR LEADERSHIP
YEAH
YEAH IT'S YOUR JOB
SELL IT
YEAH
OKAY AND THE TWELVE FIFTY TWELVE UH TWELVE
TWENTY FIVE EUROS YEAH
TWENTY FIVE EUROS
NO IT'S NOT SO EXPENSIVE
OKAY
OKAY
MM
SO WE HAVE TO GIVE A
SO WE HAVE GIVE HIM GIVE IT A CUTE NAME
MUSH MUSHROOM CONTROLLER
PA
PINE APPLE
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
TWENTY FIVE EURO
OKAY
YEAH YOU TOLD ME YOU H YOU D YOU D YOU LOST YOUR CONTROL YOUR T. V. SO SO YOU NEED TO BUY ONE
OKAY
TRADITIONAL ONE
YEAH
SO THIS ONE AND THIS ONE
WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE
WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
SO BUY ONE
YEAH
PROTOTYPE YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
THANKS
NO NOT REALLY
JUST
CRAP
OKAY
'KAY SO WHE WHERE IS THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEP
WHAT SLIDES
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE MUSHROOM WAS NOT IN THE TRENDS
I MEAN THERE WAS FRUITS YEAH
YEAH
I DON'T THINK IT IS
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT ANYWAY THIS IS NOT A MUSHROOM ANYWAY SO IT'S FINE
NO I MEAN YEAH YEAH
INSPIRA INSPIRATION IS
TRUE
BUT WE SAY UH WE SA WE SAID SOLAR
YEAH
I MEAN WE GONNA TRY TO MEASURE HOW
GOOD IT IS INSTEAD OF JUST TALKING ABOUT UH WE HAD THREE KEYS KEY POINTS TO UH FOR THIS REMOTE CONTROL DESIGN AND FIRST ONE WAS UH
FANCY
LOOK AND FEEL
SO W WE'LL TRY TO JUDGE THIS FEATURE UH WITH A ONE TO SEVEN SCALE ONE BEING UH NO I THINK
UH JUST LET ME CHECK
ONE ONE BEING TRUE AND SEVEN BEING FALSE
OKAY
OUCH
SO
DO WE HAVE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL ACCORDING TO YOU
BUT IS IT
UH I'LL AGREE IT'S UNIQUE BUT IS IT REALLY
YEAH I MEAN FANCY WAS WAS DEFINED BY S FRUIT AND VEGETABLE LOOK
YEAH
I DUNNO WHERE THE LEMON IS BUT I MEAN IT'S NOT OBVIOUS
IF
I DUNNO MAYBE IMPROVING THE TEXTURE OF LIKE HAVING IT LESS SMOOTH OR
YEAH
I DUNNO
YEAH IT'S GETTING
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S
WAIT TH THAT'S THE SECOND POINT
FIRST ONE IS WE HAVE TO JUDGE THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
I MEAN
NO THE COLOUR IS OKAY THAT'S FINE
I MEAN IT'S BUT I WOULD SAY THERE IS MORE TOO MUCH RED
UM IF
RIGHT
SO FROM ONE TO SEVEN
NO SEVEN IS FALSE AND ONE IS TRUE
THREE
OKAY
THREE
THEN UH LET ME
THE OTHER CRITERION IS IS IT TECHNOLOGICALLY UH TECHNOLOGICALLY IN INNOVATIVE
YEAH BU BUT WHEN YOU SAY TECHNOLOGICALLY IT'S MORE UH I DUNNO IN THE CORE OR SINGLE
MM-HMM
NO THAT'S GOOD
YEAH
YEAH TH THAT'S ANOTHER REALLY GOOD POINT
MAYBE OKAY
SO USING THE SAME SCALE TWO
OKAY
NOW MAYBE THE MOST CRITICAL ONE
L LAST ONE W I WOULD LIKE TO JUDGE IS
IS IT EASY TO USE
YEAH BUT THIS THIS TURNING CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST RE EXPLAIN ME THE
PLEASE
YEAH
YEAH BUT HOW HOW INTUITIVE IS IT TO TURN THINGS TO CHANGE CHANNELS
LIKE IF YOU WANT TO GO FROM
YEAH BUT IMAGINE YOU Y
YEAH I'M I'M NO I'M NOT DEFINITELY CONVINCED IT'S IT'S THE BEST WAY TO IF YOU WANNA JUMP FROM I DUNNO ONE TO TWENTY
HOW CAN YOU GO DIRECTLY TO TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH
YEAH
I AGREE
I AGREE
BUT I MEAN IF YOU'RE FRO FROM TWO
YEAH JU JUST IMAGINE YOU HAVE FIFTY FIFTY CHANNELS UH
WE'RE NOT TALKING
YEAH
YEAH
HOW D HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS ANGLE IS TH IS THE CORRECT ONE
SO YOU YOU COUNT ONE DEGREE TWO DEGREES NO
I DON'T THINK SO
YEAH VOC VOCAL COMMAND IS OKAY
BUT W WE'VE SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TH L THE MAIN
AND THIS WOULD BE MORE FOR BROWSING AH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH I MEAN YOU'RE FAMOUS
YOU
MM
OKAY THE UH TH THIS LOOKS BETTER
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT HAS TO BE ON TO RECOGNISE FAS
AH THAT'S NOT THE ECOLOGICAL PART YEAH
SOLAR
SO WHICH NUMBER
SO REASONABLY IS FOUR IS ONE
SO THREE
UH WE WOULDN'T SAY I MEAN THOSE ARE SORT OF AGREED BUT THIS ONE WOULD BE MORE FIVE TO ME
I'D LIKE I MEAN THIS IS THE JUST A PROTOTYPE
I'M NOT REALLY CONVINCED IT'S SO EASY TO USE BUT I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
SO YOU HAVE YEAH
UH BY PUSHING ZERO AFTER AFTER THE FIRST ONE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH IF YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR MIND
FINE TO COARSE
OKAY
BUT THIS THIS HAS TO STAY ON THE TABLE RIGHT
THIS HAS TO STAY ON THE TABLE
YEAH BUT THEN UH WHEN YOU TURN TURN IT
JUST
IT'S
YEAH
YOU KNOW THA THAT'S THE WEAK POINT BECAUSE WITH A TRADITIONAL ONE YOU JUST HAVE ONE HAND
SURE
YEAH YOU WOULD NEVER YOU WOULD NEVER LOSE THIS ONE YEAH
YEAH
FOUR
UH IT'S EVEN EASIER TO MAYBE
OK
MM
SO AVERAGE
THREE
OKAY SO
YEAH ESPECIALLY ON THE EASY TO USE
TARGET
OKAY
MM-HMM
NO
SO WE ARE ALL ALREADY NINETEEN
YEAH
THAT'S GONNA BE DOUBLE CURVED YEAH
RATHER FOUR BUTTONS
OH NO INTERFACE
YEAH YEAH THAT'S SPECIAL COLOURS SURE
YEAH THA THAT'S WHEEL
YEAH
I THINK THE PRICE IS OKAY
UM NO
YEAH W ONE OF THE M KEY POINT IS SOLAR CELLS
YEAH
NO Y I IT DID CHANGE BUT JUST IMAGINE WE HAVE
YEAH
YEAH BUT THIS ONE ONE OF THE FEATURE WE WERE NOT REALLY
YEAH
YEAH IF
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S ONE OF THE REQUIREMENT
WE COULD TURN WE COULD TURN EVERYTHING IN EITHER YELLOW OR BLACK
BLACK THEN IS A REGULAR COLOUR SO
YEAH ONE
YEAH
SO PUSH BUTTON THEN IT'S IT'S THE NEXT EXPENSIVE ONE
YEAH THI THIS MIGHT BE
CLOSE TO
OKAY SO WHAT'S THE BOTTLENECK
DOUBLE CURVED
YEAH BUT FLAT
CASE WHAT'S THE CA
AND THEN ONE EURO LEFT
UM
UM
SO WE HAVE ONE BUTTON
ONE WHEEL
IT'S GOOD THEY'RE NOT CHARGING ANYTHING FOR THAT
YEAH Y ACTUALLY IT'S WRONG
WE'RE NOT UNDER TWELVE EUROS AND A HALF
OKAY
OKAY
SOLAR CELLS
YEAH
THAT'S NICE ARGUMENT BUT IF IT'S IT'S STILL FOUR OUR OF TWELVE
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE JUST HAVE ONE BUTTON
EASY
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT POWERFUL
YEAH
MM
UH THAT'S WHAT WE'VE JUST DONE
YEAH
UM
OKAY
WELL I THINK WE HAVE JUST HAVE TO DISCUSS IF
I DUNNO
UH THA THAT WAS GOOD BUT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE BRAINSTORMING LIKE MEETINGS MAYBE
'CAUSE WE JUST PRESENTING ONE IS PRESENTING HIS STUFF
NEXT ONE HIS STUFF AND THEN WE TRY TO COMBINE AFTERWARDS SO IT UM
YEAH BUT JUST DON'T TRUST TOO MUCH THE TRENDS
'CAUSE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IT WON'T LAST FOR TEN YEARS UH
MAYBE TWO YEARS IT'S DEAD
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT THIS IS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S NOT A LONG LONG LIFE PRODUCT
T. V. IS MORE LIKE FIFTEEN YEARS MAYBE SO
IF YOU HAVE A LEMON LEMON T. V. FOR
FIFTEEN YEARS
YEAH YEAH
THA THAT WOULD THAT WOULD MAKE IT
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
IT'S PARTY PARTY REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
UH-HUH
TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEAH I THINK IT'S
IT'S CHEAP YEAH
NO I
I'M NOT SO HAPPY ABOUT THE FRUIT SHAPE YOU KNOW
YEAH
NO THE COLOURS ARE UH IT'S PERFECT YEAH
TRUE
UH YEAH ANOTHER THING IS THE LOGO IS MISSING STILL
UH
STILL THAT WAS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE HAD
IT'S YEAH BUT IT I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A PROBLEM JUST PUTTING THE LOGO SOMEWHERE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
CUTE NA
YOU CANNOT SAY MUSHROOM BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE TREND
IT'S NOT THE TREND
YEAH BUT JUST FLYING SAUCER OR
I WOULD SAY FLYING SAUCER
IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE SOMEHOW
MM
MM
YEAH BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW
WE HAD SOME PROBLEMS GOING TO TWELVE EUROS AND UH I DUNNO
YEAH AFTERWARDS IF
IF IT'S A NEW TREND
OKAY
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE
MM
YEAH
OUR FINAL PROTOTYPE WHICH YEAH
OKAY
GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY
OH EVERYBODY IS NOT READY
ALRIGHT
OKAY LET'S GO
SO WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TO HAVE OUR FIRST KICK OFF MEETING ABOUT UH THIS NEW PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO TAK TO TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES

UM YOU ARE THE
OKAY
OKAY VERY GOOD
THANKS FOR BEING HERE
UM SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK TO THE THE AGENDA
SO
WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS AGENDA UH AND MAINLY FIRST TO UH TO MAKE TO TO BE USED TO THE TOOLS UH AVAILABLE IN THIS NICE AND SMART MEETING ROOM WE HAVE HERE
UM THEN WE'LL GO TO UH THE PLANS FOR PROJECT AND HAVE GENERAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT
SO THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO UH DEVELOPED A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UM IT SHOULD BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND ALSO USER FRIENDLY
AS USUAL WE WILL FOLLOW THE THE PROJECT METHOD UM THAT WE ARE USING IN THE IN OUR COMPANY
IT IS IN THREE STEP AS YOU KNOW
FIRST THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
THE SECOND'S A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THEN THE DETAILED DESIGN
DURING EACH STEP UH OF EACH DESIGN WE WI YOU WILL WORK UH S SEPARATELY
INDIVIDUALLY ON UH YOUR SPECIFIC TASKS AND WILL M WE WILL MEET TO UM TO DISCUSS AND TAKE DECISIONS ABOUT UH WHAT YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU DID AND WHAT UH WE WILL DO NEXT
SO FIRST
WE HAVE TO TO TRAIN OURSELF WITH ALL THE UM THE TOOLS AVAILABLES IN THE IN THIS NICE MEETING ROOM AND UH PARTICULARLY THE THE WHITE BOARD SO UH WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE WHITE BOARD AND TAKE SOME UM S SOME NOTES OR DO SOME DRAWINGS
SO WHO WANT TO START
MISTER
YOU HAVE ONE IN MIND
OKAY
TH THANK YOU
VERY INTERESTING
GUILLERMO YOU WANT TO
IT WOULD BE VERY FUNNY FOR US
OH
OKAY
THANK YOU
HEMANT
POOR ELEPHANT
YES
WE HAVE TO I HAVE TO CATCH YOU SORRY
WE HAVE TO TO GO THROUGH THE MEETING
THANK YOU
YEAH WE'LL DISCUSS A F A FLY OR DO WE'LL DO ANOTHER MEETING ABO ON ELEPHANTS
SO SO ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROJECT IS ABOUT MONEY UH AND ABOUT SO ABOUT FINANCES
SO WE SHOULD TARGET SELLING PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE EURO FOR THIS REMOTE CONTROL
AND UH WE HAVE UM WHICH WHICH WOULD GENERATE A PROFIT OF OF UM FIFTY MILLION EUROS OKAY
AND WE SHOULD TARGET THE INTER AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
O THIS IS THE NEXT TOPIC WE HAVE TO DISCUSS EXACTLY SO LET'S GO TO IT
SO UM WE SHOULD DECIDE WHICH KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL WE WANT TO UH WE WANT TO UH WE WANT TO GO
SHOULD BE SHOULD SHOULD IT BE UM SPECIFIC REMOTE CONTROL TO SOME SPECIFIC DEVICE
SHOULD IT BE A UNIVERSAL ONE
AND UH ETCETERA
SO UM SO I'M WAITING FOR YOUR FOR YOUR INPUTS VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY THREE THREE MINUTES TO GO
OKAY
OKAY I THINK THIS IS MORE A JOB TO OUR MARKET PERSON YEAH
SO IT SHOULD BE THE TOPIC OF MAYBE OF THE NEXT MEETING JUST TO TO HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THIS AND UH IN WHICH DIRECTION WE SHOULD GO
SO WE NEED TO CLOSE THE MEETING
UH WE'LL HAVE A NEW MEETING SOON AND UH SO THE WORK EVERY EVERY OF YOU HA HAVE T D TO DO
SO UM YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THE ON THE WORKING DESIGN
YOU HAVE TO UH WORK ON THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS AND UH YOU HAVE TO WORK ON US USER REQUIREMENTS SPECS ALRIGHT
UM YOU WILL RECEIVE SOME INFORMATION BY EMAILS I AS USUAL
THANKS FOR COMING TODAY
THANKS
UH ALMOST
READY
I'M UH MICHAEL
I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
AH WELL IF NO ONE ELSE WANTS TO YEAH
OKAY SO WANT ME TO DRAW MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
LET'S SEE
WELL I DON'T REALLY HAVE A FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT UM UH I THINK I HAVE ONE IN MIND SO UH
I'M GONNA ABOUT THE UH SPIDER BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DRAW IT PRETTY WELL IN THE CORNER OF A WHITE BOARD
THE SPIDER HAS A SPIDER LIVES IN A WEB
AND UH
IT HAS EIGHT LEGS
AND UH IT CAN MOVE ALL ABOUT THE WEB IN TWO DIMENSIONS
UNLESS IT'S A THREE DIMENSIONAL WEB WHICH Y THEY HAVE SOMETIMES
THERE ARE SOME SPIDERS THAT LIVE IN LIKE THAT HAVE LIKE UH KIND OF A A BIG BALL OF A OF A WEB
AND UH THE OTHER THING IS SOME SPIDERS CAN ACTUALLY UH FLY LIKE UH THEY HAVE UH THEY LET OUT LIKE UH A STREAM OF LIKE THE WEB BUILDING MATERIAL BUT IT'S IT ACTS LIKE A PARACHUTE SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY KIND OF GO AND FIND NEW UH BUILD A NEW WEB SOMEWHERE ELSE
SO I THINK THEY DID THIS IN UH IN CHARLOTTE'S WEB THAT MOVIE THAT LITTLE UH WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A BOOK FIRST BUT UH
UM AT THE END ALL THE THE SPIDERS KINDA FLEW AWAY
SO THAT'S MY ANIMAL
MAYBE IT'S HAPPY 'CAUSE IT JUST ATE SOMEONE
SO YOU DON'T LIKE PINK PANTHERS
SO IS THIS UH AN INDIAN OR AN AFRICAN ELEPHANT 'CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DRAWN THE EARS
OKAY
WE CAN DISCUSS THAT OFF LINE
SO COULD I JUST ASK ONE QUESTION UM
IS THIS A STAND ALONE UNIT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING
SO IT'S GONNA BE YOU ALREADY HAVE A T. V. BUT YOU'RE BUYING AN EXTRA REMOTE CONTROL FOR IT OR SOMETHING
OKAY ALRIGHT
OKAY WELL SO
IT SEEMS THE THE FIRST THING THAT THEY'VE KINDA SPECIFIED IS THE PRICE LIKE BASED ON HOW MUCH PROFIT WE WANNA MAKE WHICH SEEMS TO
A KIND OF A LITTLE STRANGE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THE PRODUCT IS YET
BUT I GUESS IF THAT'S IF THAT'S THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE NEED TO TO DESIGN THE THE PRODUCT TO ACTUALLY FIT THAT
THAT PRICE BRACKET SO I GUESS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY YOU KNOW
WHAT PEOPLE AR ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR UM WHAT KIND OF PRODUCT THEY'RE EXPECTING FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO BECAUSE IT SEEMS QUITE A LOT FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT'S
YEAH
OKAY
ALRIGHT
GOOD MORNING
AND I AM HEMANT THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DRAW A PANTHER
SO BAD I DON'T LIKE IT
UM SURE
OH YEAH
THANKS
THIS LAPEL IS COMING OUT ONCE IN A WHILE
IT'S NOT VERY STRONG
OKAY
SO NOT THE FAVOURITE ANIMAL BUT I THINK I'LL DRAW ELEPHANT
I'LL TRY TO DRAW ELEPHANT
IT'S A PROBLEM
OKAY THANKS
OKAY SO ELEPHANT GOES LIKE THIS
AND THEN IT HAS
FOUR FEET
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S ANY DIST THERE SHOULD BE ANY DISTANCE OR NOT BUT
I THINK THIS IS THE EASIEST
AND THEN WE HAVE IT'S TRUNK
AND
YEP SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AN EYE CUTE
YEAH SO
AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A HUMP
IT SEEMS THAT UH ELEPHANTS ARE PRETTY FRIENDLY AND THEY THEY HAVE ONE VERY IMPORTANT WAY A DIFFERENT WAY OF WALKING
SO WHEN THEY WALK WHEREVER THEY ARE GOING TO PUT THEIR FIRST FEET THE SECOND FEET WILL ALWAYS BE
WHEN THEY'LL COME TO THAT POSITION THE SECOND THE THIRD FEET WILL BE THERE
THAT'S THE WAY THEY WALK
AND THAT'S VERY PECULIAR ABOUT THEM
NONE OF THE OTHER ANIMALS WALK LIKE THIS
AND THEY ARE VERY USEFUL TO HUMAN BEINGS
AT LEAST FEW FEW HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS NO MEANS OF TRANSPORTATIONS OR SOMETHING
OR WHEN THEY HAD TO CARRY HUGE UM LOADS FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER ELEPHANTS WERE VERY USEFUL
AND THEY ARE FOUND IN UM USUALLY THE WARM COUNTRIES
AND UM THEY ARE THE BIGGEST TERRESTRIAL ANIMAL
THAT'S WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THEM
SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO TELL ABOUT ELEPHANTS
THERE ARE TWO KIND OF UH YEAH THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT INDIAN AND AFRICAN ELEPHANTS
SO INDIAN ELEPHANT IS HAVING ONE BUMP I THINK AND THE AFRICAN HAVE TWO
AND THEN THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE TRUNK OF THE ANIMALS THESE ELEPHANTS WHO ARE INDIAN AND
SO AT SOME FOR SOME ELEPHANTS IT'S THE TRUNK IS HAVING ONE
DO WE HAVE SOME MESSAGE THERE
WIND UP
OKAY SOME OTHER TIME
THANK YOU
THANKS
MARKETING PERSON
MM-HMM
THANKS
HI I'M GUILLERMO
I'M THE MARKETING EXPERT
'KAY
I DUNNO WHY BUT WHEN I WAS A CHILD I I WANTED TO BE A A PANTHER NOT A PINK PANTHER OR MAYBE YES
UH YEAH YEAH
OKAY IT'S A FRIENDLY PANTHER
YEAH MAYBE
UM
ACTUALLY HONESTLY I I I DUNNO WHAT'S WHAT'S HIS IT'S BE BEHAVIOUR I DUNNO IF IF IT'S THE MALE WHO WHO HUNTS OR IT'S THE FEMALE UH
I I I HAVE WATCHED THAT LIONS DI DIDN'T HUNT IT'S THE THE FEMALE LIONS WHO WHO HUNT SO BUT
I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S FAST AND IT'S BLACK AS WELL SO IT CAN
HE IT CAN HIDE ITSELF VERY EASILY AND IT'S IT'S IT LOOKS LIKE UM POWERFUL STRONG UH I DUNNO
I I WATCH A A FILM ABOUT A BLACK PANTHER WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND I WAS IN THAT AGE WHEN EVERYTHING WAS SHOCKING ME A LOT
OKAY
I LIKE IT
YEAH
OKAY EVERYBODY IS READY
GOOD MORNING AGAIN
SO TODAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A F SECOND MEETING
OH MICHAEL HI
YOU'RE LATE
YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON FOR THAT
VERY GOOD
OKAY LET'S HAVE A LOOK TO THE AGENDA TODAY
SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MEETING ABOUT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
UM SO FIRST BEFORE STARTING I W JUST GOING TO UH TO GO QUICKLY TO THROUGH THE MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING
SO UH BASICALLY WE WE ARE NOT DECIDED IF W WE SHOULD GO FOR A UNIVERSAL OR SPECIFIC UH UH REMOTE CONTROL
BUT I HAVE NEW UM NEW I INPUTS FOR ABOUT THAT TOPICS
I GOIN I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU
AND UH BASICALLY WE DECIDED TO UM TO UH GO TO INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS FOR EACH OF YOU UH SO UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD WOR WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK ON TH ON TH ON THE WORKING DESIGN
YOU SHOWED US YOU AR YOU YOU PREPARE SOMETHING FOR US
THE U. I. GUY ALSO UH WORK ON THAT YEAH AND FOR THE MAR OUR MARKETING EXPERT SHOULD DELIVER SOME SPECS
ALRIGHT SO SO WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH THREE OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS
BUT FIRST I WOULD LIKE QUICKLY TO UH TO DECIDE OF TO GIVE A NAME TO THE PROJECT
SO I JUST PUT D QUICKLY REMO
BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY O OTHER NAMES THAT WE CO COULD DECIDE FOR JUST TO TO KEEP SOMETHING FUN FOR OUR PROJECT WE WE SHOULD WE COULD DISCUSS QUICKLY
ANY IDEAS
POWERSTICK YEAH
WHAT ELSE
WHAT ELSE
MANGO
MANGO
MANDO
M. A.
M. A.
M. D. O.
MM OKAY
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
OH
HMM
NICE
OKAY
SO LET'S GO FOR MANDO
YEAH
NO OBJECTION
GREAT
SO
OKAY I THINK THIS IS
OKAY
OKAY I THINK THIS IS MORE A QUESTION OF OF I I THINK THIS IS MORE A QUESTION OF OF LOOK AND FEEL
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED LATER
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD GO TO OTHER FOR THE OTHER TOPICS
YEAH OKAY SO LET'S STICK F TO MAN MANDO FOR THE NAME AND WE'LL SEE FOR THE FOR THE LOOK AND FEEL LATER
SO LET'S GO FOR THE THREE PRESENTATIONS RIGHT NOW
SO WHO WANT TO START
SO MAYBE WE COULD START WITH THE MARKET YEAH
OKAY SO I HAVE YOUR SLIDES SOMEWHERE
PARTICIPANT FOUR
THIS ONE
S THAT'S COMING
UH OKAY
GREAT
MM-HMM
OKAY
SH NEXT SLIDE
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
SOMETHING WITH THE SHAPE OF THE PALM
ON THE SIDES
AND THEN FINALLY
YEAH
FIRST I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE L. C. D. STUFF BECAUSE UH BECAUSE
YEAH SO MAYBE IT'S A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO UH TO BRING YOU TO SOME NEW UH NEW INFORMATIONS
WE HAD THE NEW REQUIREMENTS FROM THE SO UH FROM THE HEAD OFFICES OF THE COMPANY
AND SO THEY WANTED SO THEY WANT TO UM THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE RESTRICTED TO T. V.
OKAY I DUNNO IF YOU HAD THIS INFORMATION ALREADY
NO SO THEY WANT US TO RESTRICT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO T. V. ONLY BECAUSE OF TIME LIMITATIONS
UM THEY WANT ALSO UH
EXCELLENT
SO WE HAVE ALSO TO FOCUS MORE ON THE INTERNET ASPECTS BECAUSE WELL WELL TE TELETEXT IS OUTDATED NOW
AND UH FINALLY IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THE CORPORATE IMAGE
THAT MEANS COLOURS AND LOGOS OF THE CO OUR COMPANY SHOULD BE CLEARLY INDE IDENTIFIED IN THE PRODUCT
SO
YEAH YEAH
SURE SURE
SO MAYBE WE CAN JUMP TO YOUR PRESENTATIONS RIGHT NOW
OKAY SO LET'S KEEP IN MIND ABOUT THA THAT THAT THIS LAST POINT ABOUT L. C. D. AND SPEECH UH RECO
SORRY WHAT IS YOUR
OKAY MICHAEL
SORRY
UM YEAH
THE WHEEL DOESN'T WORK
LOOKS LIKE A P. D. A.
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY CAN YOU CONTINUE PLEASE MI
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY THANKS
YOU WANT TO GO
THIS ONE
GREAT
NO NOT THAT ONE
YOU ARE TWO
ALRIGHT
OKAY SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE THAT THERE IS A NEW WAY OF INTERACTING THAT USE WHEEL
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT INCREASES THE THE COST ALSO
DO YOU THINK THAT PERFORMANCE OF SUCH SYSTEMS ARE ENOUGH TO TO TARGET WELL OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES IS ENOUGH
OKAY
WELL WH UH I IMAGINE ALSO THAT THE MICROPHONE WILL BE AN AMBIANCE UM A UM AN AMBIENCE MICROPHONES BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SPEAK INTO INTO TH INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT COULD BE S A FEW CENTIMETRES
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY WE SHOU WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS LA LATER AFTER AFTER AFTER THIS THIS UH SLIDE
THIS IS A THIS IS A THIS IS A A VERY IMPORTANT UH ISSUE IN DISCUSSION
OKAY NEXT
UH THAT FINISHED
NO
COMPONENTS
YES SURE
OKAY
OKAY
SO YOUR
YOUR OPINION IS THAT WE SHOULD GO FOR SPECIAL CONDITION TECHNOLOGIES
YEAH
OKAY SO
OKAY GENTLEMENS WE HAVE TO TAKE SOME DECI DECISIONS RIGHT NOW
UM SO IF I IF I KIND OF SUMMARISE EVERYTHING WE'VE DE WE WE SAID
WE ARE TARGETING T. V.
WE NEED WE NEED TO HAVE UM UM REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS FANC FANCY
WHICH IS UH WHICH IS EASY TO TO HAND NOT TOO SMALL NOT TOO BIG
UM WE HAVE OR GOOD SHAPE YES
WE SHOULD BRING NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLES AND UH AS WE HAVE UH ALSO REQUIREMENTS TO TO USE UH TO TO PUSH THR TOWARD THE INTERNET
MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN STICK TO IT
AND UM ALSO
A VERY INTERESTING THINGS I I I'VE SEEN ON ON ON THE ONE OF THE COMP O OUR COMPETITOR IS THIS WHEEL THAT WE CAN USE TO NAVIGATE
SO SO MY FEELING IS THAT RE REGARDING COSTS BUDGET WE HAVE AN AN AN TARGET PRICE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO GO S TO GO TO L. C. D.
AND ALSO TO GO TO AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES
UH FIRST M M WHY NOT TO GO TO L. C. D.
BECAUSE UM IN FACT AS WE ARE TARGETING UH T. V. IN FACT WE CAN USE T. V. SCREEN AS A SCREEN TO FEEDBACK TO TO GIVE SOME FEEDBACK INFORMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE COULD HAVE
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
DON DON'T YOU HA DON'T WE HAVE CONTACTS WITH UH PEOPLE ON T. V. OR OR WELL SYSTEMS THAT EXIST THAT WE CAN USE
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S GOOD POINT
WHAT'S WHAT COU WHAT COULD BE THE COST OF UH WELL
COULD WE FIT THE THE TARGETS UH IN TERMS OF COST UH IF WE GO S TO L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
SO YOU MEAN YO YOU MEAN WE WE SHOULD TARGET SOMETHING MAYBE WHICH IS WHICH WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT RE REALLY FANCY IN TERMS TO UM IN TERMS TO HAD TO HAVE REALLY AN ADDED VALUE
OKAY SO REGARDING THE AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION I THINK THIS IS
THEY HAVE TELE TELETEXT
WELL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TELETEXT ON IT
TH TH YOU HAVE A TELETEXT SIN SIGNAL THAT YOU CAN THAT YOU CAN UH THAT YOU CAN GET THR THROUGH THE CHANNEL
THEY HAVE T MOST OF THEM HAVE TELETEXT
BUT WE WANT TO GET RID WELL ONE OF OUR REQUIREMENTS IS TO UH TO MOVE TO TELETEXT TO UH TO THE USE OF INTERNET
SO TO TO UH
TO BROWSE MORE EASILY THE TELETEXT
FOR INSTANCE THROUGH UH THROUGH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
THE TI THE START TIME ALL THE P ALL THE PROGRAMMES YOU COULD HAVE UH O
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FROM TELETEXT ALSO
WELL BECAUSE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT WE CANNOT
UH INFORMATIONS ON THE T. V.
WE C WE COULDN'T GRAB INFORMATION INFORMATION WHICH IS NOT THERE
SO SO THAT MEAN W W WE NEED AN IN AN EXTRA INTERNET CONNECTION TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL
IF YOU WANT TO BROWSE IN ADDITION TO THE T. V. OR UH OR IT SHOULD BE A SPECIAL T. V. CONNECTED TO
OKAY
WE NEED TO CLOSE THE MEETING
UM SO
VERY QUICKLY
NO
YEAH WELL PEOPLE GO TO BUY ANOTHER REMOTE CONTROL WHEN THEY BROKE N BROKE THEIR
AND THEY WANT TO GO T FOR UNIVERSAL ONE AND THEY TAKE THE FANCIEST THEY CAN HAVE
SO THIS IS THAT WE Z THAT THAT WE SHOULD TARGET
SO THE COM THE UM THE UH THE COMMITTMENT IS THE FOLLOWING WE DON'T GO FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY
THE L. C. D. IS STILL ON DISC IS STILL OPEN TO DISCUSSION
IT IS UP TO YOU TO GO THROUGH THIS UM UH THIS WAY AND TO TO REPORT REPORT ME BACK NEXT MEETING
SO
YEAH BUT NOT SURE
MAYBE IT'S CHEAPER BUT WE HAVE NO
OKAY THIS IS THIS IS AN OPEN QUESTION FOR YOU
YEAH
THIS IS UH UP TO YOU TO TELL US
BUT I'M DEFINITELY NOT KEEN ON TO TO NO NO NO I'M NO I'M DEFINIT DEFINITELY NOT KEEN ON GOING TO SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES
I'M NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH
I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT WE'LL HAVE A PRODUCT REALLY THAT WORK
I UH THAT WORK
IT'S REAL YEAH
HOW TO GUARANTEE SUCH PERFORMANCES IS REALLY HARD
WELL THIS IS STILL IS IS VERY BAD
SO THIS IS THE END OF THIS DISCUSSION
NEXT MEETING UH HERE ARE THE TASK YOU HAVE TO WORK ON
UM SO YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THE COMPONENT UH CONCEPT
UH YOU HAVE TO WORK ON USER INTERFACE AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A TREND WATCHING
OKAY
SO THE QUESTION IS STILL OPEN ABOUT THE L. C. D. THING
UM UH WE I HOPE THAT NEXT MEETING WE WILL UH WE'LL TAKE SOME UM DECISION THAT DIRECTION
THANKS
BYE
YEP
YES
MM
UH THE POWERSTICK
MAYBE A SPANISH NAME WOULD WORK WELL
ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE SELLING INTO THE U. S. MARKET BECASUE THERE'S A LOT OF SPANISH SPEAKERS THERE
MAYBE SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS COOL IN ENGLISH BUT SOUNDS FUNNY IN SPANISH
MANDO
WHAT IS THAT
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN SPANISH
CONTROL
OKAY
'CAUSE IT ALSO LIKE IN ENGLISH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW THE MAN'S TOOL YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW MEN LIKE TO HAVE CONTROL OF THE REMOTE SO IT MIGHT
THE MANDO
YEAH THAT'S
AND WE COULD HAVE SOME LIKE YOU D YOU COULD HAVE THE FONTS YOU KNOW SPECIAL
SO YOU HAVE MAN IN LIKE IN IN UH IN ONE O IN ONE FONT AND THEN THE O. AS LIKE
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T WANNA CUT UH CUT WOMEN OUT OF THE UH POTENTIAL BUYERS THOUGH DO YOU
SO
YEAH
MARKETING
WELL THAT'S THE THING
WE NEED TO KNOW WHO WE'RE SELLING IT TO BEFORE WE CAN REALLY DECIDE ON A
UM
YEAH
MORE LIKELY
WELL TH THE ON THE THING IS THOUGH MOST REMOTE CONTROLS ARE USED BY MORE THAN ONE PERSON
SO
UNLESS YOU'RE KIND OF TARGETING SINGLE PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA MAYBE
CUT OUT SOME A LOT OF YOUR MARKET
STILL SHAPED FOR YEAH FOR YOUR HAND BUT NOT FOR A PARTICULAR HAND RIGHT
WELL IT CAN STILL BE A YOU CAN STILL EXTEND PAST THE HAND
UH
WELL IT MEANS LIKE
THIS REMOTE HERE IS KIND OF IS VERY THIN AND LONG SO INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE IT KIND OF A BIT BIGGER OR
YOU KNOW WITH MAYBE SOME SOME FINGER MOLDS OR SOMETHING
SOME FINGER GRIPS MAYBE
YOU COULD EVEN HAVE SOME BUTTONS LIKE YOU KNOW ON THE SIDES AND EVERYTHING BUT
YEAH
YEAH
NO
I WAS STILL UH I WAS STILL WORKING ON THIS UH TWENTY FIVE EURO PRICE POINT BECAUSE I THINK ACTUALLY HAVING LOOKED AT SOME OF THE REMOTES OUT THERE
THIS IS QUITE A LOW UH PRICE IF IF WE'RE MAYBE I CAN GET TO THIS IN MY PRESENTATION THOUGH BUT UM YEAH
YEP
OKAY
YEAH
I THINK EVEN EVEN IF IT WAS WITHIN BUDGET DO A SPEECH RECO REC SYSTEM IT MIGHT BE A BIT DIFFICULT BECAUSE IF YOU THINK IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF THIS UH BACKGROUND NOISE FROM THE T. V. WHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE
UH PARTICIPANT THREE
YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME BACKGROUND NOISE FROM THE T. V. WHICH WILL MAKE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION MUCH UH HARDER SO
OH YOU PRESS A PRESS A BUTTON TO TALK AND THE THE T. V. THE T. V. SOUND TURNS OFF
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
OKAY SO COULD I DESCRIBE THE MOUSE MAYBE BE EASIER TO COULD I USE THE MOUSE OR
MM
THANKS
OKAY
GREAT
OKAY SO UM WHILE UH RESEARCHING THIS THIS TOPIC I FIRST OF ALL JUST THOUGHT OF A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A REMOTE
AND JUST UH LOOKED TO SEE IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE IN ANY CURRENT REMOTES
AND THEN ALSO SEARCHED FOR WHICH ARE THE TOP RATED UH REMOTE CONTROLS ON EPINIONS DOT COM
WHICH IS A A YOU KNOW A A CUSTOMER UM WRITTEN BASICALLY REVIEW SITE
SO UM THERE'S A PRETTY WIDE RANGE OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS THESE DAYS AND AND UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL ON THE RIGHT HERE IS IS ONE OF THE MORE EXTRAVAGANT
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY IT'S BY NO MEANS UH
MM YOU KNOW ON IT'S OWN IN BEING SO EXPENSIVE
THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPENSIVE REMOTE CONTROLS OUT THERE
SO YEAH IT DOE IT'S WELL BASICALLY ALL THE FUNCTIONS UH ARE CONTROLLED THROUGH THROUGH THE L. C. D. SCREEN EXCEPT FOR THE REALLY REALLY KIND OF MAIN FUNCTIONS
WHICH HAVE A COUPLE OF OF THEIR OWN BUTTONS
UM AND IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE UNIVERSAL REMOTES OUT UM ON THE MARKET I KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON TELEVISION REMOTE
BUT A LOT OF THE UNIVERSAL REMOTES OUT THERE HAVE UH HAVE THESE L. C. D. SCREENS WHICH KIND OF HELPS WHEN YOU'RE USING MULTIPLE UH DEVICES I SUPPOSE BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE KIND OF FUNCTIONS D DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ON THE SCREEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES
BUT UM THE THING THAT I FIND MOST INTERESTING ABOUT THIS REMOTE CONTROL
AND IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO UH TO SEE IN THE SLIDE BUT IT HAS A SCROLL WHEEL ON IT
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE UH A MOUSE SCROLL WHEEL WHICH I THINK IS IT'S A REALLY KIND OF IMPORTANT DESIGN ASPECT UM IS IT'S
'CAUSE THE THING IS WHAT A WHAT WE THE PRESEN THIS PRESENTATION WE HAD IS WHAT WE WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO ACTUALLY DO
AND OBVIOUSLY THE THE SIMPLEST THING THAT A REMOTE CONTROL DOES IS IT JUST CHANGE THE CHANGE THE CHANNEL
NOW UM
UH THE I THINK THAT A SCROLL WHEEL IS ACTUALLY PRETTY A PRETTY HANDY WAY OF OF CHANGING THE CHANNEL
'CAUSE I KNOW WHEN I UM WHEN I USE THE REMOTE TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL I VERY RARELY USE THE NUMBERS ON THE ON THE PAD
I USUALLY USE THE UP AND DOWN BECAUSE MOST CHANNELS ARE YOU KNOW TWO DIGIT NUMBERS AND YOU HAVE TO PRESS YOU KNOW A SPECIAL BUTTON TO ENTER A TWO DIGIT NUMBER
AND THEN TWO NUMBERS SO THAT'S JUST UH IT'S ANNOYING
SO I THINK A SCROLL WHEEL IS IS QUITE HANDY
NOW UM THE THE SCROLL WHEEL IS IS MUCH MORE USEFUL IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN
AND THIS BRINGS US TO THE THE POINT YOU WERE MENTIONING BEFORE ABOUT THE INTERNET UH CAPABILITY
ONE POSSIBILITY
IF WE NOW WE NEED TO STILL TALK ABOUT THE PRICE POINT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THIS STUFF CAN'T BE DONE FOR TWENTY FIVE EU UH EURO BUT
ONE POSSIBILITY IS TO DOWNLOAD PROGRAM INFORMATION INTO THE L. C. D. SCREEN SO THAT INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY SAYING I WANT TO I WANT TO GO TO CHANNEL THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE I KNOW THIS PROGRAMME'S ON
YOU KNOW OFTEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT CH WHAT CHANNEL IT'S ON OR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ON
IF YOU HAVE A LIST OF OF PROGRAMS ON YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN YOU JUST SCROLL TO THAT PROGRAM RATHER THAN TO A CHANNEL
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A YOU KNOW IN MOBILE PHONES NOW YOU DON'T USE YOU DON'T REMEMBER PEOPLE'S PHONE NUMBER
YOU REMEMBER THEIR NAME AND YOU GO FIND THAT NAME AND RING IT
SO THIS WOULD BE PRETTY KIND OF A HANDY THING TO HAVE BUT UM WE WE REALLY NEED T TO DISCUSS THE PRICE
SO I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE UH CHEAPER THIS IS ANOTHER MULTI KINDA PURPOSE REMOTE CONTROL WHERE IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY SIMPLE
THERE'S ONLY A FEW BUTTONS BUT AL EACH OF THOSE BUTTONS DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT
SO THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE WE MIGHT WANNA CONSIDER IS REALLY KIND OF LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS
BECAUSE THIS IS THE TOP RATING UH UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL ON ON EPINIONS
IT IT'S REALLY UH MAYBE WORTH THINKING ABOUT LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS AS MUCH AS AS POSSIBLE UM BECAUSE REALLY I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE BUTTON THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND WAS SAYING BEFORE ABOUT HAVING DIFFERENT SIZE BUTTONS FOR DIFFERENT YOU KNOW FREQUENTLY USED UH TASKS
BUT I THINK ALSO YOU KNOW THE LOCATION AND AND SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS
SO IF YOU HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS IT IT IT INCREASES THE THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING THE ONE YOU WANT
SO
YEAH WELL WE W
YEAH WELL WE WILL HAVE A BIT OF A SIMPLER UH TASK IN THAT WE'RE ONLY DOING UH A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
UM I THINK MAYBE ONE OPTION IS TO HAVE YOU KNOW A LITTLE FLIP OPEN UM DOOR THAT UH THAT YOU HAVE HIDDEN MOST OF THE TIME
BUT CONTAINS THE EXTRA BUTTONS LIKE SAY THE NUMBER BUTTONS FOR INSTANCE
UM
I I WOULD IF I HAD MY PERFECT REMOTE CONTROL I'D PROBABLY JUST HAVE NO NUMBERS AT ALL ON IT BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST IN THE WAY
THEY DON'T REALLY DO ANYTHING
MAYBE YOU KNOW I ALTHOUGH I DO ALSO FIND FLIP OPEN DOORS A BIT OF A PAIN BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY CAN BREAK OFF OR OR WHATEVER
BUT MAYBE A DOOR THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN PERMANANTLY REMOVE OR PERMANANTLY HAVE ON WOULD BE GOOD
UM BUT I THINK DEFINITELY YOU NEED TO TO KEEP THE BUTTONS DOWN TO A MINIMUM
BUT NOT NOT LET THAT KIND OF INTERFERE WITH THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OF THE DEVICE
UM
WELL I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU MARKET IT
IF YOU IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT ADVERTISEMENT SHOWING HOW HOW HOW EASY IT IS AND HOW YOU CAN
YOU KNOW NAVIGATE TO A PROGRAM WITHOUT THE NUMBERS THEN PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT LOOKS PRETTY EASY
SO BUT YEP
UM OKAY SO
I THINK UM ONE OF THE REALLY KIND OF USEFUL THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH WITH INTERNET CONNECTIVITY WOULD BE TO HAVE THIS A PROGRAMME DRIVEN INTERFACE RATHER THAN THE CHANNEL NUMBER
SO IF WE CAN HAVE A HIGHER PRICED UH REMOTE CONTROL I THINK THAT WOULD REALLY BE WORTH UH SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE WORTH IMPLEMENTING
UM MM THERE'S THE L. C. D. SCREEN UM WHICH MAYBE MAYBE IS TOO EXPENSIVE UM BUT I THINK ALSO AT THE SCROLL WHEEL
I HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT HERE THE SCROLL WHEEL COULD BE USED WITHOUT AN L. C. D. SCREEN JUST FOR CHANGING CHANNEL NUMBERS EASILY
I THINK EVEN THAT I MEAN THAT WOULD BE A FAIRLY CHEAP THING COMPARED TO AN L. C. D. SCREEN
TO IMPLEMENT UM BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE QUITE USEFUL AS WELL
AND THE OTHER THING YOU SAY WE NEED TO WE NEED TO KEEP IT JUST TELEVISION
BUT I THINK ONE MAYBE ONE OPTION SINCE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A KIND OF A FASHIONABLE DEVICE
IS YOU KNOW THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND OF COOL OR WOW FACTOR THAT YOU CAN KIND OF YOU CAN HAVE WITH TECHNOLOGY
AND MAYBE WE WANNA MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT'S EXTENSIBLE TO DO OTHER TASKS
SAY YOU HAVE LIKE UM A LITTLE ANOTHER LITTLE KIND OF BASE UNIT THAT CAN ALSO RECEIVE SIGNALS AS WELL AS THE TELEVISION WHERE YOU CAN
SAY UH CHANGE THE LIGHTING IN THE ROOM
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING MAYBE YOU COULD SELL AS AN EXTRA SO THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PART OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT
BUT YOU KNOW LATER ON YOU COULD YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU ALSO SELLING THE POTENTIAL OF THE DEVICE
THEN YOU SAY POTENTIALLY YOU CAN THEN DO OTHER COOL STUFF LIKE CHANGE THE LIGHTS
I DUNNO CLOSE THE WINDOWS WHATEVER TURN THE HEATING ON AND UM
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE MAY NEED TO HAVE AS AS AT LEAST AS AN OPTIONAL EXTRA TO TO KINDA MAKE OUR PRODUCT COOL
SINCE WE SAY WE'RE PUTTING THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
HMM
WELL ONE ONE OTHER THING THAT THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION COULD REALLY BLOW OUT THE PRICE FOR IS UH WHEN YOU WANT TO SELL INTO OTHER MARKETS
THOUGH BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE GONNA SELL THIS BUT I PRESUME IT'S NOT GONNA JUST BE ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES
SO THEN YOU HAVE TO S YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TRAIN MODELS FOR
YEAH
YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU COULD ACTUALLY TRAIN THE REMOTE CONTROL AS YOU'RE USING IT BY SAYING YOU KNOW TURN VOLUME UP
AND YOU PRESS THE UH PRESS THE BUTTON LIKE UH S PEOPLE TEACH SIGN LANGUAGE TO KIDS F WELL BY SPEAKING AND DOING
YEAH
ACTUALLY I'M NOT SO SURE BECAUSE I'M THE YOU KNOW IF I WAS USING A REMOTE CONTROL TO SAY
TURN THE VOLUME UP BECAUSE I CAN'T HEAR IT VERY WELL
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO YOU KNOW DROWN OUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING BY TALKING YOU KNOW WHEN I'M WHEN I'M INSTEAD OF PRESSING UP ON ON A REMOTE CONTROL
YOU KNOW IF THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME DIALOGUE ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT I CAN'T HEAR
I'M TRYING TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT WHAT'S BEING SAID SO MAYBE SPEECH RECOGNITION GETS IN THE WAY MORE THAN IT HELPS
WELL IT DEPENDS IF IT'S A REMOTE CONTROL TH
MAYBE IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SOMETHING THAT Y YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO PICK UP ANYMORE THAT WOULD BE A A USEFUL FEATURE OF THE SPEECH RECOGNTION
IF YOU CAN LEAVE IT SITTING ON THE TABLE AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO FIND IT THEN THAT COULD BE
WELL IT DEPENDS THOUGH WELL IT DEPENDS
IF WE WE DON'T UNLESS WE HAVE SOME INPUT SOME VIDEO INPUT TO THE T. V. OR WE HAVE CONTROL OVER THE T. V. THEN WE CAN'T ACTUALLY DISPLAY THAT
LIKE IF WE IF WE PRODUCE THE T. V. S THEN THEN YEAH WE CAN PUT YOU KNOW MENUS UP UP THERE
BUT OTHERWISE WE NEED TO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME KIND OF SOMETHING SITTING IN BETWEEN THE VIDEO SIGNAL AND THE AND THE T. V. TO SUPERIMPOSE THOSE THOSE MENUS
SO THAT'S AN EXTRA
COST
WELL THIS IS THIS IS ANOTHER QUE WE STILL HAVEN'T REALLY DEFINED THE REMOTE
ARE WE STILL YOU SAY WE'RE FOCUSING ON T. V. BUT IS IT STILL A KIND OF LIKE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE IN THAT IT'S A REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL
OR IS THIS SOMETHING FOR OUR OWN LINE OF OF TELEVISIONS
'CAUSE THAT REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
'CAUSE EVEN IF WE HAVE CONTACTS WE CAN'T REALLY PRODUCE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT CAN BRING UP MENUS ON OTHER OTHER COMPANIES' T. V. S
IT'S JUST THERE ARE TOO MANY T. V. S OUT THERE
IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY GONNA
FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO
I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
BUT BUT I DUNNO
I THINK UM IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY LEVERAGE IN THAT ANY LEEWAY IN THAT UM THAT TWENTY FIVE EURO BECAUSE FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO I THINK ALL WE CAN REALLY DO IS PROVIDE A VERY BASIC REMOTE CONTROL
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE KIND OF AGAINST THE PHILOSOPHY OF OUR COMPANY WHICH IS YOU KNOW PUTTING THE FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS
SO I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE OF OF INCREASING THE UH
OF INCREASING THE UNIT PRICE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE YEAH
WELL TH
'CAUSE YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE THE PROGRAMME NAME INSTEAD OF THE CHANNEL NUMBERS LIKE AN INTERACTIVE PROGRAMME GUIDE
YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE INFORMATION ON IT
SO YOU COULD HAVE THE NAME OF THE PROGRAMME YOU COULD HAVE UM THE START TIME YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S UP TO
YOU COULD HAVE A L EVEN A LITTLE IMAGE OF YOU KNOW THE C YOU KNOW THE THE M THE MAIN ACTORS OR SOMETHING SO YOU CAN QUICKLY JUST KIND OF EVEN WITHOUT READING
WELL NO BUT THERE ARE THE ELECTRONIC PROGRAMME GUIDES OUT THERE
THEY MAY NOT HAVE PICTURES BUT MAYBE THEY DO
THERE'S DEPENDI IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE COUNTRY
NO BUT I MEAN WITH THE INTERNET YOU HAVE FLEXIBILITY OF WHERE YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION FROM
SO IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE PROVIDING THAT
UH
WELL I I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA I THINK WE WOULD DEFINITELY NEED THE INTERNET CONNECTION BECAUSE EVEN WITH Y I DON'T THINK YOU COULD EVEN GET TELETEXT INFORMATION FROM THE T. V. ONTO THE REMOTE CONTROL
ESPECIALLY IF WE DON'T CONTROL THE T. V.
I DUNNO
WE NEED TO FIND THAT OUT
MM
IF IT'S A REALLY SMALL T. V. MAYBE
WELL THE THING IS I THINK I THINK THE TYPE OF PEOP
I THINK THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA WANT TO BUY A VERY STYLISH REM R REMOTE CONTROL WITH LOTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE THE KINDA PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA HAVE YOU KNOW A WIRELESS INTERNET CONNECTION MAYBE
OR A YOU KNOW
WELL THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO FIND OUT
CAN WE CAN WE INCREASE THE THE PRICE POINT OF THIS REMOTE CONTROL
'CAUSE OTHERWISE WE NEED
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO GUARANTEE THAT YOU'RE GONNA
NINETY FIVE PERCENT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH THOUGH
YEP
YEP
YEAH
YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH THEY ARE THE MOST T. V. WATCHER
SO WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL
YEP
WELL MAYBE IT COULD BE A UNIVERSAL DESIGN
A UNIVERSAL DESIGN WHICH IS WHICH IS GOOD FOR BOTH THE HANDS
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT WHETHER IT'S LEFT HAND OR RIGHT HAND BUT BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE TWO POINTS ARE CLASHING
ONE THING YOU ARE SAYING DESIGN SHOULD FIT THE HAND SHAPE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE VERY SMALL
THE FIRST AND THE THIRD POINT THEY ARE CLASHING
OKAY
SO FITTING THE HAND DOESN'T MEAN MUCH THEN
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
SO IT MEANS DESIGN SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE TRADITIONAL ONES
LITTLE SLEEK LONGER
AND IT SHOULD FIT THE HAND
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM HM MM-HMM MM-HMM
NO IT COULD BE COMMAND CONTROL KIND OF THING
IT REQUIR RECOGNISES PARTICULAR SEQUENCE AND THEN IT GETS ACTIVATED
MEANS YOU SAY YOU SHOULD SAY LIKE DOES THAT REMOTE CONTROL BEING ON OR BE ON KIND OF THING
AND THEN REMOTE CONTROL COMES IN THE PICTURE FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
BECAUSE THIS KIND OF THING MEANS SPEECH IS THERE FROM THE T. V. ALSO
SO THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING COMMAND CONTROLLED YOU START AND THEN YOU STOP
IT'S LIKE V. I. EDITOR YOU ARE HAVING TWO MODES SIMILARLY
OTHERWISE IT'S JUST LYING IDLE
CHANGE THE CHANNELS
YEAH
MMM-HMM MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM THEN THE USER HAS TO UNDERSTAND EACH OF THAT FUNCTIONALITY
BECAUSE THE SAME BUTTON IS DOING TOO MANY THINGS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IT DOES SAMPLING OUT OF THE
YEP
SO YEAH
SO MOST OF THE THINGS WHICH WE ARE DISCUSSING ABOUT IS SPEECH RECOGNITION UH THAT MEANS ON MY OWN I YEAH IT SHOULD BE
TWO
OKAY SO THE WORKING DESIGN IS UH USER I INTERFACE COULD BE OF TWO TYPES
ONE IS THE USUAL PRESS BUTTONS WHICH ARE THERE SO THAT THE USER FEELS THAT HE IS KNOING DOING SOME HE IS KNOWING ABOUT THAT TECHNOLOGY
SO HE IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE IF HE WANTS TO GET THIS
AND ON TOP OF THAT THERE THERE COULD BE A SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ALSO BEING SITTING ON THE ON THE REMOTE
SO THE OLD KIND OF USERS WHO DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY CHANGES IT CAN
IT CAN BE USEFUL FOR THEM AND THE NEW USERS AS UH OUR MARKETING EXPERT WAS SAYING
THEY CAN USE THE NEW GIZMO WHICH IS SPEECH RECOGNITION KIND OF THING
THAT'S RIGHT
SO ANYWAY THAT DIDN'T COME INTO MY MIND SO TH THAT IS A POSSIBILITY
THESE COULD BE OTHER KIND OF INTERFACES
MEANS WE CAN HAVE DEPENDING ON THE COST HOW MUCH WE CAN AFFORD WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF INTERFACES
SO SPE BUTTONS ARE SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY EVERYBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH
SO IF YOU GO TO THE MARKET AND YOU SAY THAT BUTTONS ARE THERE THE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IT IS
AND ON TOP OF THAT IF WE ARE HAVING EXTRA FUNCTIONALITY PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO SHELL THAT TWENTY FIVE EUROS MONEY WHICH WE ARE THINKING
OTHERWISE WE ARE JUST LIKE OTHERS IN THE MARKET
SO ANYWAY THAT IS THE FIRST USER INTERFACE COULD BE OF MORE THAN ONE TYPE
AND UH YEAH THAT MEANS WE CAN DO THE ON LINE CHANGES WHICH WHICH CANNOT BE DONE NOW ACTUALLY
SO APART FROM THE SPEECH WE CAN HAVE THE SCROLL KIND OF THING WITH THE BUTTONS
NOW FOR BUTTONS NORMAL REQUIREMENTS LIKE BIT CODING AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE REQUIRED
AND FOR VOICE LIMITED VOCABULARY AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS REQUIRED AND WE REQUIRE A MICROPHONE ALSO TO BE SITTING THERE ON THE REMOTE
UH THAT'S RIGHT
BUT UH MEANS WE HAVE TO SEE HOW MUCH WHAT KIND OF MICROPHONES AND STUFF LIKE THAT
UH YES IF IT IS LIMITED VOCABULARY USUALLY IT'S ENOUGH
YEAH WE WE CAN UH TARGET MEANS WE CAN TARGET NINETY FIVE PERCENT ACCURACY OR SOMEWHERE NINETY SEVEN PERC
THAT'S RIGHT
NO IT IT COULD BE LITTLE D YEAH IT COULD BE
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
MM-HMM MM-HMM
UH IT'S MORE LIKE MEANS THERE ARE DIFFERENT SPEECH TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ARE EXISTING SO D. T. W. COULD BE KIND OF WHICH IS THE EASIEST
SO YOU HAVE TO STORE SOME TEMPLATES ON THE ON THE
ON THE CHIP ITSELF AND IT'S JUST DYNAMIC TIME WARPING WHERE YOU TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS
INSTEAD OF HAVING A MODEL WHICH HAS TO BE TRAINED AND BEING A MICRO CONTROLLER
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
SO WE CAN
THAT'S RIGHT
YEP
YEP
NO NO
COMPONENTS
YEAH
SO WILL YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
YEAH SO THIS IS THE DESIGN WHICH WE ARE THINKING SO
WE ARE HAVING A POWER BUTTON AND THE SWITCH WHICH IS NOT MUCH
AND THEN WE ARE HAVING THE WHICH IS TO INDICATE WHETHER THE POWER IS ON OR NOT
AND THEN THERE ARE TWO KIND OF THINGS WHICH CAN BE SO ONE IS THE BUTTON INTERFACE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN BECAUSE BECAUSE OF LACK OF TIME
SO WE COULD NOT PUT THAT
SO NOW WHERE THE A. S. R. DECODER IS SITTING SIMILARLY THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF INTERFACES WHICH COULD BE THERE
SO THERE IS A. S. R. DECODER WHICH COULD BE THERE AND THEN THERE COULD BE ANOTHER SCROLL BUTTON SCROLL SCROLLER
AND THEN THERE COULD BE BUTTONS AND ALL OF THEM THEY WILL JUST DO THE DECODING AND PUT IT IN THE MATH PUT IT IN THE PROPER MESSAGE FORMAT
AND THEN THERE IS THERE IS THE CHIP WHICH IS SITTING THE GREEN ONE AND IT CONVERTS IT INTO BIT CODES
AND THAT BIT CODES ARE SENT BY THE INFRARED DEVICE TO THE RECEIVER
SO THIS IS THE EASIEST DESIGN THE THERE COULD BE
SO TH AN A. S. R. DECODER WE CAN HAVE THINGS IN
TO HAVE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES
SO THIS WAS THE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE WAS THAT WE CAN HAVE A. S. R. SITTING THERE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
YEAH BUT UH AS SOON AS YOU TRY TO PUT THE MICROCHIP KIND OF THING OR SOMETHING THE PRICE WILL GO UP
SO THESE ARE THE SLIGHT PROBLEMS
BECAUSE YEAH THE REASON IS THAT IF WE GO INTO THE MARKET MEANS THOUGH I DON'T HAVE MUCH IDEA BUT AS HE THE UH MARKETING EXPERT PRESENTATION WAS
SO IF WE GO WITH JUST THE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
ARE
BUT JUST A SMALL THING WHAT KIND OF MARKET WE ARE TARGETING
IS IT THAT WE ARE TARGETING THE REPLACEMENT REMOTE MARKET OR WHAT
SO THE REMOTE HAS GONE BAD AND THE PERSON WANTS TO BUY A NEW REMOTE OR BECAUSE THE COST OF L. C. D. THING COULD BE AS HIGH AS THE T. V. ITSELF
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT
BROKE
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
IT'S IT'S CHEAPER AS COMPARED TO THE L. C. D.
MEANS TH YEAH TWENTY FIVE EUROS IS YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
OKAY
UH
MM I WAS THINKING OF THE
MANDO
MANDO
A. N. YEAH D. O
IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T SOUND COOL FOR ME BUT MAYBE FOR A SPANISH FOR I FOR
CONTROL
BUT MM YEAH
MANDO SOUNDS
LATINO
BUT YEAH IT UH
YEAH BECAUSE IF THE PRODUCT WILL BE INTERNATIONAL
MAYBE MAYBE I SHOULD UH START
YEAH
MM
OKAY
YEAH
SHOULD BE IN PARTICIPANT FOUR
YEAH YEAH
UH
OKAY SO YEAH I WILL I WILL GIVE A BRIEF OUTLINE ABOUT WHAT I WHAT I PREPARED FOR THIS MEETING
FOR THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE
FOR THE USER REQUIREMENTS
I PREPARE A MARKETING REPORT AND WE HAVE TO FIND THE WEAKNESSES AND AND THE THE IMPROVEMENTS WE COULD DO TO THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
AND ALSO I DI I DID A STUDY WITH FOR THE INCORPORATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IT SEEMS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROLS HAVE BEEN HAVE REMAINED THE SAME FOR THE LAST FIVE
TEN YEARS
THERE IS NO
NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE THE B THE FIRST NEW CONTROLS AND
YEAH
YEAH
WELL MORE MOST OF THE PEOPLE THINK THAT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE UGLY THOROUGHLY
SO AND THEY THEY ADMIT THAT THE THE THEY SHOULD UH S THEY WOULD UH SPEND MORE MONEY IN A FANCIER REMOTE CONTROL
WHICH IS WHICH IS GOOD AND IT'S INTERESTING POINT
ALSO THE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT ABOUT THE R. S. I. DISEASE WHICH IS IF YOU REPEAT THE SA THE SAME MOVEMENT
WHICH IS NOT A WITH A NOT VERY APPROPRIATE DEVICE YOU YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS WHE WHEN YOU WILL GET OLD
SO S PEOPLE ARE UH ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE THE SHAPE OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
THEY ARE ALSO THEY GET ANGRY VERY OFTEN BECAUSE THEY LOST THE REMOTE CONTROL VERY OFTEN
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD POINT TO TO L TO TO FIND A A SOLUTION TO ANY BEEP ANY ALARM OR SOMETHING INCORPORATED TO WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL EVERY TIME IT IT GET LOST
AND ALSO I FOUND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE THE THE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE THE MORE INTERESTED THEY ARE IN INCORPORATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO IN MY OPINION THE
MANDO THIS MANDO SHOULDN'T BE VERY SMALL BECAUSE THE SMALLER IT IS THE MORE LIKE THE THE LIKLIER IT IS TO GET LOST
LIKLIER OR MORE LIKELY
LIKELY
OKAY
UH PEOPLE ALSO COMPLAIN BECAUSE THEY THEY THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME SIZE OF THE BUTTONS FOR BUTTONS WHO W WHICH ARE NOT VERY USE LIKE F UH MEMORISING CHANNELS OR OR THIS KIND OF ACTIONS WHICH ARE NOT VERY OFTEN BUT
THEY THEY SHOULDN'T THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME IMPORTANCE IN THE IN THE UH IN THE REMOTE CONT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
ALSO THE Z THE DESIGN SHOULD FIT THE HAND SHAPE
SO IT MAY BE INTERESTING TO TO THINK IN A IN BOTH PROTOTYPES FOR RIGHT AND LEFT HANDED PEOPLE
YEAH
I DUNNO I TH ANYWAY I THINK IT COULD BE INT INTERESTING TO TO RELEASE SOME A A SMALL FRACTION OF OF THIS REMOTE CONTROLS
SORRY
YEAH
YEAH
SORRY
YEAH
LIKE UH
YEAH LIKE
NO NO I WAS THINKING OF SO LIKE SOMETHING YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
IT SH IT SHOULDN'T IT SHOULDN'T BE SYMMETRIC SYMMETRICAL
NOT ANYMORE
THAT'S WHAT YEAH
AND FINALLY THE INCORPORATION OF A L. C. D. OR A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM IN THE REMOTE CONTROL COULD ALSO BE INTERESTING BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE BUDGET
WOULD BE LARGE ENOUGH
BUT MOST OF YEAH MOST OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO THIRTY TO THIRTY YEARS OLD WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY
ACTUALLY THIS MARKETING REPORT IS RESTRICTED TO T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE OR DISACTIVATE SO YEAH YEAH
YEAH UH CHANNEL FIFTY
YEAH
H I THINK I THINK THAT THE TR THE TRANSITION TO THIS TO THIS NEW REMOTE CONTROL SHOULDN'T BE VERY VERY ABRUPT VERY HARD BECAUSE W IF PEOPLE SEE A REMO SEE THE SEE A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT NUMBERS MM THEY WILL THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO LEARN VERY DIFFICULT TO VERY DIFFERENT BUILD VERY DIFFERENT TO THE TRADITIONAL
IF Y
I'M SURE IF YOU CAN SELL A A SPEECH RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS EVERYO EVERYONE WILL S WILL BUY IT
I'M SURE
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW THE THE AVERAGE FREQUENCY OF PUSHING BUTTONS IT'S ABOUT
IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHTY PUSHES PER HOUR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WITH A GOOD SHAPE FOR THE
YEAH
UH
WHAT WOULD BE
WHA BUT WHAT WOULD BE ONE QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE THE GOAL OF PUTTING AN L. C. D. IN A REMOTE CONTROL
WHAT WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION
YEAH BUT MO MOST OF THE T. V. S NOWADAYS SHOW THE SHOW THE
THE N
YEAH BUT YEAH MOST OF THE T. V. S HAVE TELETEXT NOWADAYS
YEAH
SO WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD APPEAR IN THE IN THE L. C. D.
OKAY
BUT
YEAH
I THINK THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE CHEAPER THE THAN THE L. C. D.
BECAUSE WITH THE L. C. D. YOU NEED MORE REQUIREMENTS
YOU NEED A INTERNET CONNECTION
YOU NEED M MORE THINGS
BUT
FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION YOU YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING
YOU JUST SAY CHANNEL FIFTY AND THAT'S IT
BUT THEN WE SHOULD MOVE TO ANOTHER TARGET B BECAUSE AT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IT'S
TO MOVE TO ANOTHER TARGET
THE EXPERT UH SAID NINETY FIVE PERCENT
OKAY
GOOD AFTERNOON
HOPE YOU HAVE GOOD LUNCH
OH
NICE
AND YOU
OKAY
SO TODAY IS UM
OUR THIRD MEETING
IT WILL BE ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN UH
IF I COME BACK TO UH THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETINGS
UM
WE DECIDED NOT TO GO FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE OF SOME REASONS AND WE ARE NOT DECIDED ABOUT U THE USE OF L. C. D. SCREEN ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE OF COSTS
SO MAYBE WE COU WI WILL BE ABLE TO CLARIFY THIS THIS QUESTION TO TODAY
UH AT THE END OF THE MEETING WE SHOULD TAKE DECISION ON THAT POINT
SO I HOPE UH THAT YOUR RESPECTIVE PR PRESENTATIONS UH WILL HELP US
SO EACH OF YOU HAVE SOME PRESENTATIO PRESENTATION TO PERFORM UM WHO STARTS
SO MARKETING
SO YOU ARE YOU SAVED YOUR Y YOUR PRESENTATION SOMEWHERE
SO YOU'RE FOUR
WHICH IS TREND WATCH
OKAY
MR MARKETING EXPERTS
SO
MM-HMM
NEXT SLIDE
YEAH
OKAY
MM
DRAWINGS OF BANANAS
UH-HUH
WELL SO THIS IS IN THE NEXT SLIDE CERTAINLY
IT'S NOT
SO MAYBE YOU MAYBE YOU CAN DISPLAY A BANANA ON THE L. C. D.
APPLE FOR CHANNEL ONE
OKAY
THAT'S A QUESTION
MAYBE TOO LONG
A BANANA
OKAY
YEAH AND YOU YOU YOU WILL NOT HAVE PLA ENOUGH A LOT OF PLACE TO PUT A L. C. D. ON A BANANA ALSO
WELL YOU'RE THE MARKETING EXPERT YOU SHOULD TELL US IF IT IS TOO MUCH OR NOT
SO
SO YOU YOU YOU SUGGEST TO GO F
OKAY
S SO YOU'RE SIMPLY YOU'RE SIMPLY LOOKING S TO A REMOTE CONTROL THAT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA WITH FEW BUTTONS WITH ONLY A FEW BUTTONS
OKAY GOOD
SO MAYBE YOU CAN GO AHEAD
OKAY
THANKS
UM
OKAY I'LL GIVE THE FLOOR
SO YOU ARE USER INTERFACE GUY
SO YOU'RE THREE
AND IT'S THIS ONE
GO FOR IT
I THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I
UNCLEAR REALLY UNDERSTANDING
IS THIS A TECHNOLOGY THAT RECOGNIZE KEYWORDS SPEECH KEYWORDS
AND IT'S JUST TO IT'S JUST TO PLAYBACK SOMETHING
YEAH YEAH
SO THIS IS NOT S REALLY TO DO TO TO DO CONTROL
YEAH
THIS IS JUST MORE LIKE A POI POIS YEAH
YEAH YEAH
SO IT IT'S C UH IT IT IT IS A UH UH EASY UH A FANCY THING THAT YOU YOU CAN BRING TO WE CAN BRING TO THE REMOTE CONTROL THAT WILL NOT HAVE ANY UH YEAH COMP COMPLETELY POINTLESS FOR THE INTER FOR FROM THE INTERACTION POINT OF V POINT OF VIEW
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
SO THIS IS SO THIS IS THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN TAK TAKING THIS TECHNOLOGY BRINGING IT TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AND USING IT
SO THIS IS OUT OF DISCUSSION
SO IF IF IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN WE CAN BRING EASILY AND TO PUT IT INTO THE BANANA REMOTE CONTROL
NO THIS IS MM BANANA BANDO YEAH
UH THEN IT COULD BE COOL YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A BANANA AT ALL
YEAH
BUT YOU YOU CAN FIT I YOU'RE SAYING NOW YOU CAN FIT IT TO
YEAH
MM
IT'S ENOUGH
SWITCH ON
YEAH
OKAY
SO I IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING COMPLETELY TO FORGET ABOUT THE L. C. D. THING
I THINK THAT
NO WE CAN WE CAN'T USE THAT
WE CAN'T USE THAT TO
TO COMMAN CO COMMUNICATE IT'S JUST A THING
NO
YEAH
YEAH
A GOOD GOOD GOOD THING
YOU WANT TO G TO MOVE TO YOUR SLIDES
YOU'RE FINISHED
YEAH I THINK SO
MM-HMM
MM
EXACTLY YEAH
OH GOOD IDEA
VERY GOOD
OKAY LET'S MOVE ON
SO YOU'RE TWO
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
MM BUT I BUT THERE IS NO ELASTICITY WHICH COULD BE
YEAH BUT THE COMPONENTS INSIDE
YEAH
VERY TOO EXPENSIVE TO DO
AND ALSO UH
YEAH BUT IT'S MORE EASIER TO DO A BANANA IN PLASTIC THAN UH IN WOOD
WELL IT LOOK LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE ALL TARGETING THAT YEAH
YES IT IS
YEAH
PUMPKIN
GREEN
UM UM UM YES I SEE
PEP PEPPERONI
POIVRON
UH PEPPER
BUT UM THEY DO D
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S NOT RE IT YOU YOU THINK IT'S REALLY FANCY AND FUN
YOU THINK THAT YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE
YEAH
MORE THAN A BANANA
YEAH
IT'S KIND IT'S KIND OF IT'S MORE UH IT'S REALLY ERGONOMIC IT'S FIT IN THE HAND AND YOU'VE A LOT OF SURFACE TO TO PUT THE CONTROLS
OKAY LET'S MOVE ON
SO TIME IS RUNNING LET'S MOVE ON
OKAY
S OBJECTS
CRAZY OBJECTS
OKAY
OKAY GOOD
BU IT'S IT'S
YOU S YOU YOU THING
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU THINK THAT YELLOW IT'S KITSCH
IF YOU MAKE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A BANANA IT SHOULD HAVE THE COLOUR OF A BANANA
O OTHERWISE
ROUGHLY
YEAH
OKAY
LET'S MOVE ON
UH UH YEAH
BEFORE BEFORE ST BEFORE ENDING THE MEETING I'D LIKE TO TO DRAW SOME SKETCH ABOUT THE PRO FUTURE PROT PROTOTYPE
GO FOR IT
WELL NO NOT NOT YOU YOU CAN FINISH YOUR SLIDES BEFORE
MM OKAY
OKAY
THAT'S ALL
OKAY SO MM SO WELL DONE FOR THE PRESENTATIONS
SO WE NEED TO TAKE SOME DE DECISIONS ABOUT UM ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
SO I I PROPOSE THAT YOU GO TO THE WHITEBOARD AND WE'RE GOING TO REPORT ALL THE IDEAS WE HAD WE HAD DURING THIS THESE PRESENTATIONS JUST TO DRAW SOME SKETCH ABOUT WHAT WILL BE THE PROD FINAL PRODUCT AND UH WHERE SUPERMAN GO BANANA AND UH UH EXTRA FUNC FUNCTIONALITIES SUCH AS WHEELS
UM THE SPEAKER UNIT UM WELL NOT IN ORDER NOT TO LOST THE UM THE DEVICE I DO I DON'T REMEMBER YOU CALL IT
BASIS STATION YEAH
UH SO UM SO WE'RE GOING FOR A STYLISH
BANANA SHAPE
YEAH RIGHT
WE
I IF IT I IF IT HAS REALLY THE MODEL SHAPE OF A BANA YOU COULD THE THE STARTING IS GOOD BUT IT COULD IT SHOULD HAVE MORE THE SHAPE OF A BANANA IF YOU WANT TO POINT REALLY A AT THE THING
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TO TO DO THAT MOVEMENT WHICH IS WHICH IS DIFFICULT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT IN FACT IT'S BETTER
SO TI TIME IS RUNNING WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO TO MOVE FORWARD
SO LET'S SKIP TO UH THIS UH THIS THIS THIS IDEA
YEAH
SO WE HAVE THIS
WE HAVE A A BASIS UM HOW DO YOU CALL IT
A BASE STATION
WE'LL HAVE A BASE STATION EXTRA UH ON THE SIDE
YEAH
UH WE HAVE A R. F. FOR UM FOR BEEPING FOR BEEPING
WE NEED B R. F. TO BEEP
SO WE THAT MEANS WE NEED A BUTTON ON TH ON THE ON THE BASIS
BASIS STATION THANK YOU
CAN YOU GO QUICKLY PLEASE
OKAY
SO WE ARE GOING TO ADD UH ALSO UM YOU AS YOU SUGGESTED THE WHEE SOME WHEELS TO CONTROL THE VOLUMES AND CHANNELS AND YOUR TUR TURBO TURBO UH BUTTON
YEAH ON THE TH YEAH MAYBE HERE
AND THE AND THE WHEEL A A AT THE LEVEL OF THE THUMB FOR INSTANCE
AND AND YOU HAVE TWO WHEELS
OKAY RIGHT
GOOD
SO NO L. C. D.
OKAY GREAT
UM
VERY GOOD
YEAH
OH JUST THE SWITCH NO F NOT FOR THE T. V. FOR THE T. V.
UH SO YOU
ON THE SIDE
TWENTY FIVE
YEAH
SO
WELL
NO
TIME IS RUNNING WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE MEETING IN A FEW MINUTES
SO OKAY THE NEXT STEP YOU CAN COME BACK TO YOUR SEAT
THE NEXT STEP IS TO GO FOR TO F IS TO GO TO UH
TO BUILDING A PROTOTYPE BASED ON THIS OKAY
SO NEXT MEETING YOU GUYS HAVE TO PREPARE THE FOLLOWI THINGS
YOU HAVE TO UH WORK ON THE LOOK AND FEEL UH DESIGN AND YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE
IN FACT YOU TWO YOU HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MODEL THE FIRST UH F FIRST PROTOTYPE
UH MARKETING EXPERT UH HAVE TO GO TO PRODUCT EVALUATION
OKAY
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT
IT'S NOT A POSSI IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT IT FOR THE NEXT PROTOTYPE SO T IT'S IN THE NEXT PROTOTYPE SO LET'S SKIP IT
YEAH MAYBE FOR THE N IF IF IF IT IT WORKS WELL WE'LL GO FOR UH AN ORANGE ONE
YEAH YEAH HONOUR THE FRUIT
OKAY
THANKS VERY MUCH
WE'LL SEE N NEXT MEETING
BYE
THANK YOU
HI
UH YES I HAD SOMETHING SIMILAR
BUT NON VEGETARIAN
YEAH
WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND SPONGY
WHAT YOU MEAN CLOTHE
NO I MISSED THAT ONE
OH THEY'RE OKAY SO THEY'RE NOT LIKE DRESSED AS A CARROT THEY JUST HAVE LIKE PICTURES OF FRUIT ON OKAY
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL IN THE SHAPE OF OF A BANANA JUST MAYBE
OKAY AND
SO WHICH FRUIT ARE YOU THINKING OF
OH SO YOU WANT THE REMOTE CONTROL TO BE THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT OR YOU WANT JUST SOME KIND OF LIKE FRUIT LOGO ON THE
SO SOMETHING THAT LOOKS HALF LIKE A FRUIT AND HALF LIKE AN ELEPHANT
BUT OKAY I'M NOT I'M NOT REALLY SURE
IF UH THAT WOULD REALLY APPEAL TO EVERYONE THOUGH MAYBE JUST TO FASHION GURUS
LIKE MAYBE JUST LIKE A LITTLE BIT N A LITTLE FRUIT PICTURE SOMEWHERE IN THE CORNER
BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT UH I DUNNO HOW ERGONOMIC A AN ORANGE IS
TO FRUIT
BUT IS IT UH IS FRUIT COOL
IS FRUIT COOL
WELL I GUESS YOU KNOW APPLE HAS THE IPOD SO IMAGI JUST 'CAUSE THEY HAVE AN APPLE ON THEIR
ON THEIR PRODUCT DOESN'T MEAN FRUIT IS COOL
OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE EASY TO UH TO USE THOUGH AND TO HOLD YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANNA PEAR OR A WATERMELON
WELL PROBABLY THE ONLY THING IS A BANANA THAT I CAN THINK OF A CUCUMBER
I DUNNO
MAYBE
TOO GREEN
SO BUT I MEAN YOU ALSO HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO ALSO HAVE FIT R ALL THE BUTTONS AND YOU KNOW
IT'S IT
THE THING IS YOU HAVE T NORMALLY WITH UM WITH BUTTONS
THEY HAVE TO BE AT SOME POINT ATTACHED TO A CIRCUIT BOARD SO IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THINGS LIKE ON A CYLINDRICAL KIND OF DEVICE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO KIND OF TO BUILD
YEAH
WELL THIS IS
OKAY
YEAH
YEP
YEP
OKAY
SO
S NEXT UH SLIDE
OKAY
SO I RECEIVED AN EMAIL UM AROUND LUNCHTIME LETTING ME KNOW THAT THE BRILLIANT MINDS AT OUR TECHNOLOGY DIVISION HAD DEVELOPED AN INTEGRATED PROGRAMMABLE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER UNIT
UM WHICH IS A WAY FOR YOU TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR COFFEE MACHINE AND OR REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S NO WHAT IT IS IT'S IT'S VERY
IT HAS A HAS A MICROPHONE HAS A SPEAKER IT'S GOT A LITTLE CHIP AND IT ALLOWS YOU T
WELL IT'S A SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER
SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER
IT MEANS THAT IT CAN RECOGNIZE
IT CAN DO LIKE A MATCH ON A ON A CERTAIN PHRASE THAT YOU SPEAK AND THEN CAN PLAY BACK A PHRASE IN RESPONSE TO THAT
BUT UH THERE'S NO KIND OF UM UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHRASE
SO I MEAN YOU KNOW I GUESS YOU COULD BUILD THAT IN
YOU COULD YOU COULD LINK THE THE RECOGNITION OF A CERTAIN PHRASE TO SOME FUNCTION ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
BUT BASICALLY THE THING IS WE HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE
IN HOUSE
SO
UM BUT THE THING IS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL GONNA BE A COST IF YOU DECIDED TO INTEGRATE THAT BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE C PRODUCTION OF THE COMPONENTS
SO UM IT IT BUT IT BASICALLY MEANS WE C WE CAN KIND OF CONSIDER THIS FROM UH YOU KNOW UH A THEORETICAL OR USABILITY KIND OF VIEWPOINT WITHOUT WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW TO DEVELOP IT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS ALREADY DONE
WHILST YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT GET ANNOYED IF WE UH IF WE JUST DUMP IT
IT'S IT IT'S NO WELL IT'S IT'LL RECOGNIZE UH I GUESS KEYWORDS BUT YOU KNOW KEYWORDS IN A CERTAIN ORDER LIKE A PHRASE
YOU TRAIN IT FOR A CERTAIN UH FOR A CERTAIN PHRASE
YOU SAY THE THE EXAMPLE THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE UH UP AND RUNNING WITH THEIR PROTOTYPE IS UM WELL THEY'VE ACTUALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE INTO THE THE COFFEE MACHINE THAT UH THAT WE'RE PRODUCING IS
YOU CAN SAY GOOD MORNING TO THE COFFEE MACHINE AND IT CAN RECOGNIZE THAT PHRASE AND IT'LL PLAYBACK GOOD MORNING HOW WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR COFFEE
YEAH
SO ACTUALLY THAT WAS A BAD EXAMPLE 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY ASK HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR COFFEE BECAUSE IT CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSE SO
ONLY LIKE ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT IT IT CAN RECOGNIZE A SET A SET TARGET KIND OF WORD AN
IT'S DESIGNED IT'S DESIGNED AS A FUN KIND OF THING BUT I GUESS YOU COULD USE IT AS UH AS A WAY TO IMPLEMENT UH
COMPLETELY POINTLESS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH UNLESS YOU KNOW YOU LIKE HAVING CONVERSATION WITH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
WELL YEAH THAT'S THE THING
IF YOU CAN BUT YOU HAVE TO PRO THOUGH I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE DESIGN SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO RECORD INTO THE DEVICE EVERY POSSIBLE COMBINATION
YOU HAVE TO S TR TRAIN IT TO L TO LEARN CHANNEL FIFTEEN THAT WHOLE THING
NOT JUST THE WORD CHANNEL AND THE WORD FIFTEEN IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF LOGIC IN IT
SO
YEAH THAT WOULD BE SOME DEVELOPMENT WORK
YEAH
BANANA MANDO
BANANA MAN
I UH I I I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH IT THOUGH I THINK IT DOESN'T REALLY ADD MUCH TO THE FUNCTIONAL
DESIGN AND IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT MATURE ENOUGH
TO USE AS A SPEECH RECOGNITION ENGINE SO
UM YEAH
SO IF WE CAN JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE
I'VE JUST DONE A QUICK MOCK UP OF UH UH SOME OF THE FEATURES OF OUR POTENTIAL FUNKY LOOKING UH REMOTE CONTROL
WELL YOU SEE I WAS I WAS UNAWARE AT THIS POINT OF TH OF THE FRUIT FOCUS
UM SO AT THE MOMENT IT'S MORE OF A BOX FOCUS
YEAH WELL THIS IS ACTU THIS COULD BE A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FRUIT THAT'S DESIGNED TO BE YOU KNOW SQUARE SO THAT IT PACKS TIGHTER IN THE BOXES
BUT UM I'VE JUST INDICATED HERE WE COULD HAVE ACTUALLY TWO SCROLL WHEELS 'CAUSE I THINK THE SCROLL WHEEL IS A FAIRLY UM KEY PART OF
YOU KNOW I THINK EVERYONE HAS HAS AGREED THAT IT'S THAT IT COULD BE QUITE A USEFUL UM THING SO
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW TO HAVE TWO SCROLL WHEELS BECAUSE
YOU KNOW YOU WANT ONE FOR FOR THE CHANNEL BUT YOU ALSO WANT ONE FOR FOR THE VOLUME
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE VOLUME I IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S VERY HANDY FOR IT TO HAVE UH INSTANT KIND OF UH FEEDBACK UH AND RESPONSE SO
BUT UM I'VE ALSO INCLUDED THIS TURBO BUTTON BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW EVERY DESIGN SHOULD HAVE A TURBO BUTTON
AND WELL SO THIS IS YOU KNOW A UNIQUE PROBLEM WITH WITH TELEVISIONS IS THAT IF YOU HAVE THIS SCRO THIS SCROLL WHEEL FOR THE TELEVISION
THE UH THE TUNER ON THE T. V. IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TO SWITCH BETWEEN STATIONS AS FAST AS YOU CAN SCROLL
SO YOU KNOW THE TH THE PERSON MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A UH
MIGHT WANT TO BE ABLE TO SCROLL PAST TELEVISION STATIONS WITHOUT SEEING WHAT'S ON THEM
IN WHICH CASE IT JUST WAITS UNTIL YOU STOP SCROLLING AND THEN YOU KNOW DISPLAYS THAT STATION
OR THEY MIGHT WANT TO SCROLL AND AND HAVE A QUICK GLIMPSE OF IT EVEN IF IT LAGS BEHIND WHAT THEY'RE DOING
YEAH SO WITH THIS TURBO BUTTON YOU CAN SAY SKIP OVER T CHANNELS IF UH YOU KNOW IF I'M IF I'M GOING IF I'M SCROLLING PAST THEM AND YOU KNOW
IT'S UM YOU COULD HAVE A LITTLE RED LIGHT THAT COMES UP WHEN THEY PRESS IT SO THEY FEEL YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY GOING FAST OR WHATEVER
SO YEAH THAT'S UM THOSE ARE THE TWO IMPORTANT UH FEATURES I THINK WE NEED ON THE REMOTE
BUT I MEAN WE CAN DISCUSS ABOUT WHAT OTHER KIND OF BUTTONS WE NEED UM
YOU KNOW I IT COULD BE YOU KNOW IF WE IF WE WANNA HAVE LIKE A VERY CHEAP KIND OF DEVICE I MEAN
WE COULD EITHER CONSIDER THAT MAYBE WE WANT TO SELL THIS AS A VERY IF IT'S GONNA BE A BANANA YOU KNOW THAT'S A PRETTY GIMMICKY KIND OF
THING THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH FUNCTIONALITY
IT'S JUST YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF SCROLL WHEELS AND A BUTTON CAUSE IT'S HARD TO GET SO MANY BUTTONS ON A BANANA AND IT'S STILL VERY IT MAY EVEN BE FOR MOST FOR SOME PEOPLE MORE FUNCTIONAL THAN THEIR CURRENT REMOTE
BUT IF THEY HAVE THESE SCROLL WHEELS SO UM YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER BUTTONS DO WE WANT
I MEAN WE COULD HAVE WELL I GUESS YOU NEED AN ON AND OFF SWITCH
BUT YOU COULD YOU COULD O YOU COULD TURN IT TURN IT ON BY TAKING THE TOP OFF THE BANANA MAYBE
YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SPY KIND OF FLICK THING
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A MARKETING GURU
WELL THAT'S THE THING AS HAVE WE DECIDED THAT WE CAN ONLY SPEND UH TWENTY FIVE EURO
WELL NOT SPEND BUT YOU KNOW CHARGE TWENTY FIVE EURO
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TEMPLATE FOR EVERY CHANNEL FOR A HUNDRED CHANNELS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TO RECOGNIZE
MM
WELL I F I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN
THAN OUR CAN HANDLE BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED FOR A COFFEE MACHINE YOU KNOW TO SAY HELLO IN THE MORNING
WELL THAT'S ITS CURRENT APPLICATION I WOULD PRESUME THAT IT'S KIND OF THEY WOULDN'T DESIGN IT TO HANDLE A HUNDRED THINGS TH SO
BUT UH
WELL I JUST I JUST MADE THE POINT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION IS YOU KNOW
EVEN IF WE CAN DO IT I THINK IT'S NOT REALLY APPROPRIATE FOR UH TELEVISION ENVIRONMENT
BUT UM I DID HAVE ONE THING FROM A PREVIOUS MEETING
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT UM BEING ABLE TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT EXTENDIN BEING ABLE TO EXTEND THE REMOTE CONTROL BY HAVING YOU KNOW
A BASE STATION THAT CAN CONTROL OTHER THINGS AS WELL
IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HAVE SOME KIND OF BASE STATION
EVEN IF IT'S JUST YOU PRESS ON A BUTTON ON IT AND UH AND THE REMOTE CONTROL STARTS BEEPING
YOU KNOW THIS IS A WAY OF FINDING THE REMOTE
Y IN THAT CASE MAYBE THE MAYBE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THE SPEECH THING COULD BE USEFUL JUST TO SAY I'M HERE BUT UH IT'S PROBABLY A BIT OF OVERKILL IF YOU COULD JUST HAVE A A BEEPING
IT'S SPEECH
IT'S IT'S SPEECH SYNTHESIS AND S IT'S SPEECH KIND OF NOT REALLY SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT KIND OF PATTERN MATCHING YEAH YEAH
I GUESS THAT FITS IN WITH THE SPONGY KIND OF DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
SO JUST ONE SECOND WHEN YOU SAY DOUBLE CURVE WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY MEAN
YOU RECKON YOU COULD LIKE DRAW US A THING ON THE ON THE WHITEBOARD 'CAUSE I'M NOT SURE
OKAY BUT LIKE KIND OF CONVEX OR CONCAVE
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW WOOD
COULD BE UH QUITE A STYLISH UH OPTION IF YOU TAKE LIKE
NICE QUALITY KIND OF WOOD THAT'S GOT A NICE GRAIN AND YOU KIND OF PUT SOME SOME VARNISH ON
WELL IT DEPENDS I MEAN
YOU HAVE THE OUTS THE WOOD ITSELF IS NOT GONNA BREAK SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE CASE BEING BROKEN IT'S THE INSIDE
YEAH BUT INSIDE YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE YOU CAN STILL HAVE SOME KIND OF CUSHIONING THAT'S NOT VISIBLE TO THE TO THE USER
AND I MEAN YOU COULD ALSO YOU CAN HAVE JUST A VERY THIN VENEER OF WOOD AS WELL
THAT'S TRUE BUT ARE WE SET ON THE BANANA
IDEA
IT'S LIKE A PUMPKIN OR
GREEN
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE
AH YEAH IS IT WHAT'S IT IN FRENCH
YEAH OKAY SO CAPSICUM OR PEPPER
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT KIND OF BULKY TO ME LIKE
LIKE WITH A BANANA YOU CAN HAVE
WELL
BUT LIKE A BANANA YOU CAN YOU CAN BE HOLDING LIKE THIS AND HAVE THE SCROLL WHEEL KIND OF ON TOP AND JUST
ROLL IT BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT BUT WITH UH I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD HOLD A CAPSICUM AND
SO IS THAT WHEN YOU SAY SPEAKER SUPPORT YOU MEAN IT JUST HAS SOME OUTPUT PINNED WHICH WHICH WHICH KIND OF
OKAY BUT THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO THE TO THE CHIP IN SOME WAY OR IS JUST THE THE SIGNAL
OKAY
OKAY
SO ARE THERE ANY ISSUES WHERE WE PLACE THIS THIS CHIP TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE THE SPEAKER FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BANANA
OKAY
YEAH BUT THE SPEAKER IF THE SPEAKER IS ACTUALLY ON THE CHIP THEN IF IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE THE CASING
OR IF THE CASING IS TOO THICK THEN YOU MAY NOT HEAR THE THE SPEAKER
YEAH
YEAH
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WITH THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL DESIGN IS TO KEEP THE THE SPEAKER CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE OUTSIDE
ALTHOUGH IF
IT DEPENDS IF WE LIKE IF WE ARE CONCENTRATING ON LIKE A FRUIT DESIGN
THEN MAYBE MAYBE WE WANNA SELL A COLLECTION OF FRUIT YOU KNOW LIKE A DIFFERENT FRUIT FOR EACH DEVICE
CAUSE THAT YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO COLLECT UM YOU KNOW THINGS THAT OF A SIMILAR TYPE
WELL YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO DO FRUIT IN THE FIRST PLACE
LIKE A POWER FRUIT
YEAH
WELL
I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY HANDY FEATURE
I THINK IT'S KIND OF PEOPLE WOULD FIND THAT WORTH IT EVEN IF IT WASN'T UH A RECHARGING STATION
EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BUY EXTRA BATTERIES YOU KNOW
SO
ALTHOUGH YOU DO NEED TO INCLUDE R. F. KIND OF CIRCUITRY IN THE REMOTE
OKAY
I'M JUST WONDERING ACTUALLY 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I THIS WHOLE FRUIT THING WITH THE BANANA
IT'S UM IT SEEMED LIKE IT FIRST SEEMS A BIT KIND OF UH NICHE
LIKE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE WOULD REALLY WANT A BANANA BUT WHAT IF IT WAS KIND OF UH A STYLISED BANANA
YOU KNOW RATHER THAN HAVING IT KIND OF YOU KNOW YELLOW AND REALLY LOOKING EXACTLY LIKE A BANANA YOU COULD MAKE IT KIND OF SILVER
AND UM YOU KNOW TO GIVE YOU KIND OF THE IDEA OF A BANANA BUT WITHOUT IT LOOKING YOU KNOW COMPLETELY
KITSCH
FOR BETTER WANT OF A BETTER WORD YOU KNOW
WELL YOU KNOW I DON I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOP
WELL THEY
YEAH LIKE THIS COLOUR THIS COLOUR
MAYBE YOU KNOW MAYBE LIKE STILL IN THE SHAPE OF A BANANA
NO EXACTLY
EXACTLY
UM BUT YOU KNOW JUST MAYBE MAYBE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME TEXTURE AS A BANANA AND JUST KIND OF
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE THING IS IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO MAKE UM TO GIVE LIKE THE TEXTURE OF A BANANA ANYWAY AND TO K TO HAVE THE EXACT SHAPE
I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT PROPERLY YOU MAY AS WELL DO IT IN A STYLISED WAY THAT JUST LOOKS A BIT MORE KIND OF
YOU KNOW TWENTY FIRST CENTURY RATHER THAN SIXTIES OR SEVENTIES
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH SO
I GUESS YOU WANNA HOLD LIKE THE WAY THE END OF THE BANANA YOU WANNA KIND OF HOLD AS MA YOU MAYBE WANNA KINDA HOLD LIKE A GUN RATHER THAN 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IT TO POINT KIND OF TOWARDS THE FLOOR
SO
YOU KNOW SO IF YOU HAVE LIKE
OKAY SO
SO
OKAY SO I GUESS WE NEED YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CAN FIT A BANANA
SHAPED OBJECT
OKAY SO IT'S UH
YEAH
ALRIGHT SO WE NEED UH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WHICH I THINK IT'S IT'S PROBABLY BEST ACTUALLY ON THE ON THE UNDERNEATH OF THE THE DEVICE SO YOU HAVE
YES
YEAH SO YOU HAVE THE THUMB KIND OF HERE
SO YEAH YOU NEED ONE ONE HERE AND ONE ON ON THE OTHER SIDE SO YOU GOT VOLUME AN AND CHANNEL
AND UH
NO L. C. D.
OH WE NEED A WE NEED A POWER UM ON OFF SWITCH AS WELL
YEAH
YEAH
WHERE
OKAY
WELL I DUNNO IF THE TRADITIONAL USER IS GONNA BUY A A BANANA REMOTE
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU KNOW
Y I MEAN YOU NEED TO KIND OF KEEP IT UM
YEAH HOW MANY OF THESE DID WE WANNA SELL
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT WAS
YEAH BUT HOW MANY UNITS DID WE NEED TO TO SELL
FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION
THAT'S A LOT OF FRUIT
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
UH
THAT CAN BE THE T
THAT CAN BE LIKE THE TURBO BANANA PLUS PLUS COMMANDO
OKAY
YEP
WE HAVE TO GO DESIGN THE PROTOTYPE
AFTERNOON
YEAH WE HAD FALAFEL
MM-HMM
SPONGY MEANS IT IT'S LIKE SP
BUT WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION HOW WE CAN HAVE SOME SHAPE LIKE THAT ON THE REMOTE
MM-HMM
MEANS BUTTONS ARE IN THE SHAPE OF FRUITS BUTTONS ARE IN THE FRAPE SHAPE OF FRUITS OR SOMETHING APPLE BANANA SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THAT WE CAN DISCUSS AFTERWARDS
BANANA
MM-HMM
I DON'T TH IT WILL BE ROLLING A LOT
BUT IT'S JUST A SPEAKER RIGHT
IT'S NOT A MICROPHONE
MM-HMM
ACTUALLY I'M NOT READING MICROPHONE THERE SO THAT'S WHY YOU CAN ALL HAVE CONVERSATION IT JUST TO SPEAK TO YOU
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
IN HOUSE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD
STABLE THING THAT'S RIGHT
TO HAVE MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
COMMUNICATE
IT'S ONE WAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT YEAH
SO IT'S A SPEECH SYNTHESIS KIND OF THING SOMETHING HAS BEEN UH STORED AND IT'S JUST UH SPOKEN OUT
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
SO THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT THE COMPONENT DESIGN
SO FIRST THING IS WE NEED POWER SOURCE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO I WAS OF THE IDEA THAT WE CAN HAVE TWO KIND OF POWER SUPPLIES ONE IS THE USUAL BATTERIES WHICH ARE THERE
THEY COULD BE CHARGEABLE BATTERIES IF THERE'S A BASIS STATION KIND OF THING AND ON TOP OF THAT WE CAN HAVE SOLAR CELLS
WHEN THE LIGHTING CONDITIONS ARE GOOD THEY CAN BE USED SO IT'LL BE PRETTY UH INNOVATIVE KIND
THEN UH WE NEED PLASTIC WITH SOME ELASTICITY SO THAT IF YOUR IF THE REMOTE CONTROL FALLS IT'S NOT BROKEN DIRECTLY INTO PIECES
THERE SHOULD BE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN T
YEAH
SO THERE SHOULD WE SHOULD THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN IT SHOULD BE DOUBLE CURVE
THE S SCIENCE FOR THE EASE OF HANDLING AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER ISSUES WHY WE NEED DOUBLE CURVE
THEN CONTROLS FOR THE TRADITIONALS U TRADITIONAL USERS WE CAN HAVE THE PUSH BUTTONS SO THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S AN ALIEN THING FOR THEM
DOUBLE CURVE IS YOU HAVE CURVES ON BOTH THE SIDES IF I'M RIGHT
SO IT'S SYMMETRICAL KIND OF THING WHATEVER IT IS
SO IT COULD BE CURVE SO IT COULD BE CONVEX CONVE CONCAVE DEPENDING ON WHAT WHAT WE WANT
SO THERE ARE FLATS THERE ARE SINGLE CURVE AND THERE ARE DOUBLE CURVES
THESE ARE THE THREE THINGS AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT MATERIALS WITH PLASTIC YOU CAN HAVE DOUBLE CURVE BUT WITH UH CERTAIN OTHER MATERIALS WE CANNOT HAVE DOUBLE CURVE
SO THERE THERE WAS UH THERE WERE MANY OTHER MATERIALS LIKE WOOD TITANIUM AND ALL THOSE THINGS
BUT PLASTIC IS I THINK IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE ONE IT'LL BRING THE COST DOWN AND ANYWAY IT'S
WOODEN CASES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
IS IT AN E APPLE WHICH HAS
BANANA IS MORE HANDIER AS COMPARED TO THIS I THINK AND TO CAPSICUM
OKAY SO PUSH BUTTONS FOR THE TRADITIONAL USERS SO THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THEY ARE ALIENATED
JUST AND A SCROLL BUTTON WITH PUSH TECHNOLOGY FOR CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME CONTROL AND TELETEXT BROWSING
THESE ARE THE THREE SCROLL BUTTONS WHICH ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE WITH US IN THE COMPANY AND WE WE CAN GO AHEAD WITH THAT
YEAH WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
THEN UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF CHIPS ONE ONE IS THE BASIC CHIP AND THE REGULAR CHIP AND ONE AN ADVA ADVANCED CHIP
SO WE CAN HAVE REGULAR CHIP FOR CONTROL
PRICING IS A FACTOR FOR US THAT'S WHY WE'LL GO FOR THE REGULAR CHIP
AND UH REGULAR CHIP SUPPORTS SPEAKER SUPPORT SO THIS FUNCTIONALITY COULD BE USED FOR TRACING THE MOBILE PHONE WHICH HAS BEEN MISPLACED
IT COULD BE A BEEP KIND OF THING
YES YES THAT'S RIGHT IT'S IT'S ONTO THE CHIP MOST MOST PROBABLY NOT NOT HUNDRED PER CENT SURE ABOUT THAT
THAT WILL BE THE VOLUME CONTROL I THINK WHICH WHICH A USER SHOU IT IT SHOULD BE ALREADY PRE DEFINED
IT SHOULD BE WHATEVER WILL BE THE CASE THE CHIP IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SITTING INSIDE
MM-HMM
UH SO WE CAN HAVE IT AT ONE OF THE BOUNDARIES SO THAT THINGS ARE SLIGHTLY BETTER
AS OR AS HEARING IS CONCERNED WE CAN HAVE SOME GAP AT SOME PLACE SO THAT
THAT'S RIGHT
OKAY
YEAH
SO THESE THESE WERE THE COMPONENT SELECTION AND THESE THINGS
WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
AND UH THESE WERE THE FINDINGS WHICH I I SAW WITH THE WEB WEB
THAT USER WANTS TO HAVE CONTROL MORE THAN ONE DEVICE WANTS TO CONTROL MORE THAN ONE DEVICE FROM THE SAME REMOTE CONTROL
SO OUR T. V. REMOTE CAN HAVE LITTLE EXTRA THINGS TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL DEVICES LIKE V. C. R. D. V. D. PLAYERS WHICH ARE USUALLY ATTACHED WITH THE T. V.
BECAUSE USERS ARE LIKE THIS AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ONE REMOTE CONTROL FOR EVERYTHING
SO WITH THIS ADDITIONAL LITTLE WE MIGHT BE HAVING SLIGHTLY BETTER MARKET FOR US
MM
OF FRUITS
MM-HMM
REMOTES OBJECTS OKAY
AND UH AS WELL AS I COULD SEE ON THE WEB THE SCROLL BUTTON IS BECOMING REALLY UH HOT THING S AND WE SHOULD HAVE IT ON THE REMOTE
SO YOU'RE HAVING A BASIS STATION
OKAY
YOUR USUALLY YOUR REMOTE SITS ON THAT
SO YOU AND IT'S THAT'S WHY IT CAN HAVE CHARGEABLE BATTERIES
NOW LET'S SAY
BASIS STATION IS WITH THE THING
IT'S LIKE A TELEPHONE HANDSET IS THERE AND THE BASIS STATION FOR THE TELEPHONE HAND SET IS THERE
SO NOW WHAT USER GETS ADDITIONALLY HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BUY BATTERIES THEY'RE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES SO OVER THE PERIOD OF COR TIME HE'LL RECOVER THE COST
SO YOU'RE HAVING THE BASIS STATION AND THERE IS A BUTTON IF YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON WHEREVER THE REMOTE IT'LL START BEEPING SO YOU KNOW WHERE THE REMOTE IS
UH
MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM MM-HMM
UH THIS IS BASIS STATION IS NOTHING MORE
JUST IT'S A WIRE WHICH IS COMING FROM THE MAIN CABLE AND UH YOU'RE HAVING ONE SOCKET ON WHICH THE THING SITS
THAT'S RIGHT
BUT ALL THESE THINGS ARE USUALLY IN HOUSE SO WE DON'T HAVE MUCH PROBLEMS
SO COMPONENT COST IS GOING TO BE THE LEAST
ANYWAY WE ARE NOT USING REALLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY L. C. D. HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED OUT A. S. R. HAS BEEN RULED OUT
SO IT'S THE BASIC THING BUT VERY TRENDY AND VERY USER FRIENDLY
AND
MM-HMM
A YEAH OTHERWISE IT'LL BE MIS MEANS YOU DON'T GET B ANY FEELING THEN
IT'S NEITHER A BANANA NOR A
AND UH GOING TO THE LAST SLIDE
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO
ANYWAY USERS'LL BE SO THE FINDINGS IS USERS'LL BE VERY INTERESTED IN OUR LOCATOR DEVICE TO FIND THEIR MISPLACED REMOTES
SO THAT WAS VERY I THOUGHT IT'S A VERY GOOD SUGGESTION BY EVERYBODY
THAT'S IT
YEP
MM-HMM
THAT'S RIGHT
THE BASIS STATION
THAT'S RIGHT
THERE'S LESS SPACE ON THIS TO PUT WITH THE BUTTONS
UH WHAT ABOUT A
THE BASE STATION
RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH WE NEED THAT YEAH
BASIS STATION
YEAH YEAH
TURBO BUTTON
OKAY
UH FOR THE REMOTE
REMOTES DON'T HAVE POWER ON OFF SWITCH
OKAY
S NO THAT'LL BE CONTROLLED BY THE THOSE BUTTONS'LL BE THERE ALREADY YEAH
MEANS ON THE REMOTE
BECAUSE REMOTE IS GOING TO HAVE BOTH THE INTERFACES SCROLL AS WELL AS BUTTONS
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO COST YOU MUCH EVERYTHING IS IN HOUSE AND NOW YOU DON'T WANT THE TRADITIONAL USERS TO BE APPREHENSIVE OF THIS
OH YEAH
THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH I DIDN'T THINK OF
BUT YOU KNOW OUR TARGETS ARE VERY HIGH MEANS FIFTY MILLION EUROS IS THE PROFIT WHICH WE WANT MAKE
TWENTY FIVE
TWELVE POINT FIVE IS THE PROFIT ON ONE
UH FORTY TH FOUR
POINT POINT FOUR MILLION
POINT FOUR MILLION
IN THE MARKET
MM-HMM
FOR THE FUTURE PROTOTYPES
SO MEETING'S OVER
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
THANK YOU
THE PROBLEM IS AFTER ALL THIS MEETING THERE IS
OKAY
YEP
FOUR YEAH
YEAH THAT'S ME
UH
WELL I INVESTIGATE THE PREFERENCE MORE D I INVESTIGATE DEEPER THE PREFERENCE OF THE USERS
UH SO THE THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION TH UH TH UH SORRY THE CURRENT
THE N
CURRENT TRENDS
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
WELL WHA WHAT I FOUND UM CAN YOU
YEAH
THANK YOU
WHAT I FOUND IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE FROM LESS TO MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT
PEOPLE WANT AN EASY TO USE DEVICE
AFTER THEY THEY WANT SOMETHING NEW TECHNOLOGIC TECHNOLOGICALLY SPEAKING
BUT THE MOST WHAT THEY WHAT THEY FIND MORE MORE INTERESTING MORE OR MORE IMPORTANT IT'S UH A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL INSTEAD OF UH INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT
THE CURRENT TREND WHICH WAS F THE FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL
SO NOW MORE MORE COOL ASPECT
MA MORE A COOLER ASPECT UH RATHER THAN A DEVICE WITH MANY FUNCTIONS AND MANY BUTTONS WITH INSTEAD OF I INSTEAD OF HA OF A DEVICE WHICH CAN DO MANY THINGS
A DEVICE WHICH IS PLEASANT TO TO WATCH TO SEE
UH ALSO
WELL IN IN EURO IN IN PARIS AND AND MILAN THE IN PARIS AND IN PARIS AND MILAN THE THE CURRENT TREND OF UH OF CLOTHES
FURNITURE AND ALL THIS
ALL THIS FASHION IT'S IT'S FRUIT AND THE THE THE THEME IS FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
AND ALSO IN THE IN THE U. S. A. THE THE CURRENT THE MOR THE MOST POPULAR FEELING IT'S IT'S A SPONGY
SPONGY MEANS EPONGE
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD THINK IN IN THIS DIRECTION SO
FRUIT VEGETABLES IS THE THE NEW HAVE YOU SEEN THE LAST EXPOSITION OF CLOTHES IN MILAN
YEAH I I DIDN'T MISS AN I DIDN'T MISS AND I SAW THAT THE FRUIT THERE ARE MANY FR PICTURES OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE CLOTHES
NO NO NOT NOT YET NOT YET
YEAH YEAH
SO TE TEXTU TEXTURES YEAH
YEAH
VEGETABLE TEXTURES AND ALL THIS KIND
UH YEAH YEAH
UH NO NO IT'S NOT
IT'S
AND
UM
I HA I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR FRUIT BUT THE GENERAL ASPECT OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
MAY MAY COULD REMIND SOME KIND OF VEGETABLE SOME KIND OF
INSTEAD OF VEGETABLE SOME NATUR MM UH NATURAL OBJECT OR SOMETHING
BUT YEAH IT IT DEPENDS ON THE
YEAH MAYBE THE SHAPE THE SHAPE
NO NOT N NOT NOT TOO MUCH FOCUS
NOT TOO MUCH FOCU NOT N NOT TOO S NOT TOO SIMILAR TO A FRUIT BECAUSE NEXT YEAR THE TEN THE TREND THE TREND WILL BE DIFFERENT
SO WE SHOULDN'T BE AT RE REALLY ATTACHED
TO TO THE TREND BUT
FOR INSTANCE YEAH
AFRICAN OR AS AN ELEPHANT
WELL MA MAYBE WE WE SHOULD FURTHER SPECIFY WHAT TARGET ARE WE FOCUSING
I THINK IN MY OPINION WE SHOULD FOCUS ON ON YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE OPEN TO NEW DEVI NEW DEVICES AND ALSO YEAH ACCORDING TO THE MARKETING REPORT NINETY P NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WAS
WAS WAS ABLE TO
TO BUY A A N A COOLER REMOTE CONTROL
WHAT
WHAT
YEAH
UH
IS THE NEW TREND
OF THE
NO I THINK WE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT A A SHAPE WITH IT A DEVICE WITH A SHAPE OF SOME
YEAH
DON DON'T YOU THINK WE CAN FIND UH THE SHAPE OF A FRUIT WHICH IS HANDY TO USE
OR M
MAYBE
UM
YEAH
YEAH BUT I LI I LIKE YOUR IDEA THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS B BUTTONS SO
UH DO YOU WANT A AN L. C. D. WITH TWENTY FIVE EUROS
I THINK
WELL ACCORDING TO THE TO THE REPORT PEOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN IN A FA FANCY LOOK AND FEEL AND IN A TECHNOLOGICAL INNO IN INNOVATION
SO I WILL GIVE MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE LOOK AND FEEL THAN RATHER THAN THE
NEW INPUTS AND ALSO IT'S I'M NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THIS L. C. D. BECAUSE YOU NEED UH INTERNET CONNECTION
YOU NEED MORE THINGS IT'S NOT JUST BUYING A NEW CONTROL RE REMOTE YOU NEED BUYING CONTROL REMOTE BUYING UH
MORE THINGS
IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE
FOR INSTANCE YEAH
YEAH FOR FOR FOR GIVEN AN AN EXAMPLE YEAH
YEAH NO IT'S WHAT I ALREADY SAID
YEAH BUT YOU CAN U
YEAH BUT THE CAN WE USE IT FOR SAYING OKAY CHANNEL FIFTY CHANNEL TWENTY
M MANDO
BANANA MANDO YEAH
LOOKS LIKE A TR LOOK LIKES A A TRO A TROPICAL FRUIT
YEAH
WHAT'S A TURBO BUTTON
IT CON IT CONTROLS THE SPEED
YEAH
SO SOUNDS CRAZY
I LIKE CRAZY IDEAS
YEAH OF COURSE
I I THINK WE COULD USE SOMEHOW THE S COFFEE MACHINE DIALOGUE INTERFACE OR SO
YOU WE CAN
WE CAN'T
YEAH BUT WE CAN SAY CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE
NO
IT'S NOT A LOT ONE HUNDRED TEMPLATES IT'S NOT
AH IT'S DESIGNED FOR A COF OKAY
IS IT DESIGN FOR A COFFEE MACHINE
OKAY
YEAH
MAYBE YOU COULD ASK YOUR THE YOU COULD ASK THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT IF WE CAN
YEAH
YEAH
ACTUALLY
I WAS THINKING THAT THE
THE SHAPE OF A BANANA IS NOT
IT'S NOT REALLY HANDY
UH I DON'T KNOW THE NAME O O IN ENGLISH UH
THIS IT'S NOT A FRUIT IT'S A VEGETABLE
GREEN
AND YOU PUT IN THE SALAD
UM
OUI C'EST CA
PEPPER
AND IT'S AL IT ALSO SUITS WITH THE DOUBLE CURVE FOR EASY OF
NO I MEAN IN A
I'M SURE IT'S FUN
BUT BANANA IS NOT SO HANDY I THINK THAT'S HANDIER
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT
I THINK THAT WOULD BE FUNNY AT THE BEGINNING BUT AFTER ONE MONTH YOU WILL BE TIRED OF BE SURROUNDED OF FRUITS
NO BUT I THINK JUST ONE FRUIT TO CONTROL EVERYTHING
A POWER FR A POWER M A MANDO A SUPERMANDO FRUIT
ACTUALLY I I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THIS TRACE SPEAKER LOST CONTROL
SO YOU YOU HAVE TO BUY TWO THINGS THE BANANA AND THE BASIS STATION
YEAH
YEAH BUT I'M A BIT WORRIED ABOUT THE BUDGET
YEAH
NO I I
MAYBE LI LIKE THAT
WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THIS SHAPE
MORE OR LESS
YEAH BUT HOW MANY BUTTONS DO WE NEED
WHAT A
WHAT ABOUT
FOUR MILLIONS
WHAT ABOUT A
I WO WHAT ABOUT ADDING THE THIS WORD SPOTTING KEYWORD SPOTTING RECOGNITION SAYING VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT BUT PEOPLE LIKE INNOVATION AND THAT'S REALLY UH INNOVATIVE AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD COST A LOT JUST A FEW FIVE WORDS
OKAY
PLUS PLUS OKAY
MAYBE OBJECTIVE BANANA
THANK YOU
OKAY
GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN
SO WE SHOULD HAVE OUR FINAL MEETING ABOUT THE DETAIL DESIGNED OF DETAIL DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM SO HERE IS THE AGENDA FOR TODAY
UH UH JUST GOING TO GO QUICKLY THROUGH THE MINUTES OF THE LAST LAST UH MEETING THEN WE HAVE A P PRESENTATION OF PROTOTYPE OF YOU TWO SOUNDS INTERESTING
AND WE'LL HAVE UM PRESENTATION OF EVALUATION CRIT CRITERIA BY OU OUR MARKETING EXPERTS
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH FINANCE EVALUATION OF THE OF THE COST OF THE THING AND UM HOPEFULLY UH WE SHOULD FIT THE TARGET O TW OF TWELVE POINT FIVE UH UH EURO
OKAY
SO LET'S GO
UH IF I GO QUICKLY THROUGH THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING
SO WE WENT THROUGH TH UH W WE TOOK THIS FOLLOWING DECISIONS
NO L. C. D. NO SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OKAY WE WENT THROUGH A B TO A BANANA LOOK AND FEEL FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE WENT THROUGH THE USE OF WHEELS AND BUT BUTTONS
AND ALSO THE USE OF A BASIS STATION FOR BATTERY CH CHARGING AND UH ALSO TO UM CALL THE TO CALL THE MOT MOTE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN IT IS LOST
OKAY
UM
GOOD
SO GUYS
LET THIS UH WONDERFUL THING
OH YEAH
SORRY
UM
WHICH IS
YEAH CAN YOU SHOW IT TO THE THE CAMERA MAYBE
MM-HMM
WHAT'S THE USE UH OF THE T TURBO BUTTON ALREADY
AH YEAH YEAH AN THEN YOU STOP WHEN YOU STOP IT STOPS
UH-HUH
WHICH ONE
OKAY
TO NAVIGATE IT THROUGH TH THROUGH TELETEXT
WITH THE WHEEL IT'S EASY
EXCELLENT
CALLING
EXCELLENT
AND THE THE LEAVES PLAYS THE ROLES OF OF ANTENNAS
OH
GREAT
SO WHAT ELSE
YEAH THEY'RE LIGHT
AH YEAH
SO FOR THE POWER SOURCE APPARENTLY YOU STILL YOU YOU WANT TO USE BOTH SOLAR CELLS AND BATTERIES
UH YOU MEAN OKAY
SO
YEAH WHERE ARE GOING TO WHERE ARE YOU ARE YOU GOING TO PLACE THEM
YOU HAVE ENOUGH SURFACE
YOU
OKAY
WHAT WILL BE THE AUTONOMY
ROUGHLY
THE AUTONOMY
AUTONOMY
UH I MEAN HOW LONG DOES I HOW HOW HOW LONG CAN IT BE HELD OFF A STATION
YEAH
A LONG
YEAH SO IT'S
IT'S USED ONLY WHEN YOU
YEAH
F WEEKS
RIGHT
NEXT SLIDE
OKAY
OKAY
THOSE REALLY SOUNDS VERY GOOD
NOTHING ELSE TO ADD
YEAH
WELL IN FACT B BOTH WILL BE COULD BE USEFUL NAVIGATING THROUGH TELETEXT
YEAH
WOW
VERY GOOD UH YEAH YOU TH YEAH
BANANAS EVERYWHERE
OKAY SO
SO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH NOW EVALUATIONS
SO YOUR SLIDES ARE READY
UH YOU'RE FOUR I THINK
SO THIS IS ONE WHICH ONE IS THIS ONE
NUM NUMBER
SO TO HAVE IN ORDER TO HAVE ENOUGH GRANULARITY IT'S IN ORDER TO HAVE ENOUGH GRANULARITY IN THE EVALUATION
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH SIX
S SEVEN
SIX
NO WAIT
WHAT DO YOU SAY SEVEN
FIVE
OKAY SIX POINT FIVE
HANDY
SEVEN
SO SEVEN SEVEN SIX
SIX POINT FIVE
FUNCTIONAL
FOUR
UH FOR A REMOTE CONTROL DOES HE HAVE ALL THE
YOU COULD EXPECT
YEAH
SO IT'S UNIVERSAL BUT FOR T. V. S
SO S UH FOUR
FIVE
FOUR
FOUR
OKAY COOL
COOL DEVICE
YEAH
SEVEN
SIX
PLUS SIX I SAY I SAID SEVEN
SO IT'S SIX
YEAH
SEVEN
SEVEN
AND YOU
OUTL YOU ARE NOT LIK OUTLIER
SEVEN
OKAY OKAY OKAY OKAY
OF COURSE I'LL BUY THE BANANA
WELL
TWENTY FIVE EUROS
CHEAP
YEAH SO THE TARGET PRICE IS FOR ALL EUROPE OR ONLY FOR RICH COUNTRIES
IT'S MORE TARGETING U. K. OR
SO THIS IS SELLING COSTS NOT PRODUCTION COSTS
YEAH YEAH SURE
UM
FIVE
AW SHOULD BE NICE IN YOUR
IT'S KITSCH
WELL DON'T FORGET WELL DON'T FOR DON'T FORGET WHO WE'RE TARGETING ALSO WHO ARE F F WHO ARE WH YEAH YOUNGST YOUNGST
NO WELL YEAH I IF YOU WOULD BE YOUNG
NOT TELLING THAT YOU ARE YOUNG
LI LI LIKE A TEENAGER FOR INSTANCE
OKAY YOU'RE YOU'RE CRAZY TEENAGER AND YOU LIKE FUN THINGS
YEAH
YEAH YOU WANT TO SHOW THE BEAUTIFUL BANANA YOU HAVE
OKAY SO YOU S YOU GIVE OH YEAH YEAH I KNOW I KNOW
SO YOU SAY TWO
F I D I SAY FIVE
YOU SAY
SO WHAT'S THE NEW QUESTION
UH YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH THAT'S TWO DIFFERENT QUESTION
UGLY
I STICK TO FIVE
W WE HAVE SIX FIVE
THREE SO WE ARE
SIX FIVE FOUR
YEAH
SO
SO AND LAST QUESTION WILL I CHANGE MY REM CHANGE MY REMOTE CONTROL FROM MANDO BANANA
UM ZERO
NO UH WE CAN'T
SO ONE
WELL IF
NO UH LET'S SAY I'LL PUT TWO
IT'S FOR THE T. V.
TWO THREE FIVE TWO THREE FI AND TWO
SO IT'S R
YEAH THREE POINT FIVE
NO NO YOU SAY FIVE HE IS THE OUTLIER
OKAY JUST JUST DO A SUM
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD UH HAVE A LOOK GLOBALLY GLOB
YEAH
SO MAYBE MAYBE W WE CAN WE SHOULD STICK TO GENERAL FEELING
WE CAN HAD UH HAVE A OUT OF THESE NUMBERS WHICH WHICH IS THAT WELL WE SHOULD GO FOR IT
PROBLEM WITH CONNECTORS
OKAY
SO LET'S MOVE UH LET'S MOVE ON
OKAY NOW NOW WE HAVE TO MM TO ESTIMATE UH THE COST OKAY
SO I PREPARE AN EXCEL SH UH AN EXCEL SHEET
UM WELL WE ARE GOING TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COSTS
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE BELOW TWELVE POINT FIVE
SO I ALREADY UH PUT SOME PU SOME NUMBERS HERE OKAY
WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH SO THIS IS THE NUMBER THE MM NUMBER OF COMPONENTS WE NEED FOR THIS THING
SO IT APPEARS THAT THERE WERE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
UH AND ALSO THINGS THAT I UH I D I FORGET TO UH TO PUT LIKE SOLAR CELLS
OH YEAH FINALLY WE SAY NO
OKAY SO LET'S LET'S GO LET'S GO LET GO THROUGH ALL THE LINES
SO HAND DYNAMO
THIS SOMETHING WE DIDN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
BUT
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY SO WE WE STICK TO BATTERY ONE
NO KINETIC ALSO
I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KINETIC AND DYNAMO
AH YOU HAVE TO AH OKAY I SEE SO KINETIC IS REALLY UH SHAKING THE BANANA
CRAZY
OKAY
SO THOSE BANANA IS FALLING
LET'S GO AHEAD
SO WE WE ST ONLY HAVE ONE FOR BATTERY
UH THEN FOR ELECTRONICS UM SO I DIDN'T PUT ANYTHING FOR THE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
NO SO WE HIN
YEAH SO ONE
OOH YE YE YE THE COST IS INCREASING
SO WE ARE
THE BEEP
THAT'S WHAT
OKAY SO I'LL REMOVE IT
S
SO DON'T WE NEED A
OH THERE IS NO LISTING FOR R RADIO FREQUENCY THING
SO
YEAH MAYBE
WE'LL SEE LATER
OKAY SO IN FOR THE CASE UM
I PUT SINGLE CURVED
BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO THINGS
NO
WELL
WHAT A WHAT I IF I PUT ONE HERE
YEAH SO LET'S PUT ONE HERE IN THE THEN INSTEAD OF SINGLE OKA ALL RIGHT
SO WE STICK TO PLASTIC IT COST NOTHING
NO IT'S TOO NO
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
WE'RE ALREADY AT ELEVEN
OKAY SO I PUT RUBBER ONE
OKAY SO SPECIAL COLOUR YELLOW
UH FOR THE INTERFACE WE HAVE
WE HAVE THREE
NO NO
WE HAVE TWO SCROLL AND WE HAVE THREE PUSH BUTTONS
AND
NO IT'S NO CHIP
THIS IS JUST RADIO FREQUENCY
TH THIS IS NO CHIP
IT'S JUST
YEAH
NO
JUST ONLY
OKAY W WE DIDN'T THINK A THOUGHT ABOUT UH INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTONS
YEAH SO
YEAH
OKAY
SO NO L. C. D.
SO FOR WE HAVE NO BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS RIGHT
UH
WELL IN FACT COULD WE COULD NOT WE CONSIDER THIS BUTTON AS A BUTTON SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE OH NO
THESE ARE THESE ARE FOR COLOURS CO AND SPECIAL FORMS SPECIAL COLOURS AND SPECIAL MATERIALS
SO
OKAY SO WE ARE OVER BUDGET
YEAH
YEAH
SO MAYB IN FACT N WE HAVE TO PUT TWO HERE
BECAUSE IT COST NOTHING
EXACTLY EXACTLY SO WE HAVE MARGIN FOR THAT STUFF
YEAH MAYBE
OKAY GOOD
WHA
EXCELLENT
UM WE'LL INVEST IN R. AND D.
YEAH
SO WELL WE'RE UNDER THE THE THE COST
SO WE CAN GO TO THROUGH TO PROJECT EVALUATION
SORRY
WHICH IS DIFFERENT
WHICH IS DIFFERENT
NONE OF US WILL BUY IT
THIS IS A BATTERY
THIS IS WHAT WE WHICH YOU CAN MM
IT DID YEAH
EXTRA BATTERY YEAH
EXAC
WELL IN FACT I I DID NOT KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY HERE
IF UH IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF WHAT WE CAN WE CAN SAY
SO
I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
WHAT THEY MEAN BY SATISFACTION UM AND FOR AND FOR EXAMPLE
SHOULD IT BE MORE LIKE UM LIKE A STATUS OF
OF THE THESE MEETINGS IN FACT
YEAH WELL IN FACT UH WE WE USE A LITTLE BIT THE WHITE BOARD AND THE DIGITAL PEN NOT THAT MUCH
OH YEAH IT'S REALLY CREATIVE
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE WE SHOULD GO THROUGH YEAH AN UH EVALUATION
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD WE SHOULD DO A KINDA EVALUATION
IN THE STREETS LIKE ASKING TO YOUNG PEOPLES WELL DO YOU LIKE TO HAVE A BANANA AS A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEP
ANY ANY NEW IDEAS WE COULD UH WE COULD INVESTIGATE NEXT TIME
DUNNO ORANGES
HMM
OKAY
VERY GOOD
SO
WELL DONE
I THINK WE WE CAN GO
HOME
YEAH
MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN HASSLE THE THE
PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT TO TO MAKE A A REAL PROTOTYPE THAT WE CAN USE AT HOME TO TO EVALUATE
OKAY SO THANKS VERY MUCH
BYE
YEAH SO UH FOLLOWING OUR DECISION TO UH
MAKE A YELLOW WELL TO MAKE A BANANA
REMOTE OKAY SO
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A
WE'VE WELL FIRST FIRST OF ALL WE MADE A AN ATTRACTIVE BASE STATION UH WITH A BANANA LEAF UH LOOK AND FEEL UM AND UH
BANA SIT THE BANANA SITS IN THERE K YOU KNOW NICELY WEIGHTED SO THAT IT'S NOT GONNA TIP OVER AND UM THIS IS THE REMOTE ITSELF
IT'S KIND OF IT'S IT'S ERGONOMIC IT FITS IN THE HAND UH RATHER WELL
WE'VE GOT THE TWO UH
UH SCROLL WHEELS HERE WHICH YOU KNOW ONE ON THE THE LEFT FOR THE UH VOLUME AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT FOR FOR THE CHANNEL AND UH UNDERNEATH WE HAVE THE UH THE TURBO BUTTON WHICH IS IN LIKE A NICE UH TRIGGER POSITION FOR YOU KNOW FOR PRESSING QUITE NATURALLY
THIS IS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU UH ARE SCROLLING THE UH THROUGH THE CHANNELS YOU CAN TELL IT TO TO SKIP TH PAST CHANNELS THAT YOU QUICKLY RATHER TH
YEAH
WELL WHEN YOU STOP SCROLLING THE WHEEL IT STOPS
BUT NORMALLY WITH UH IT WILL JUST UH S STAY ON EACH STATION BRIEFLY SO YOU CAN SEE THE THE PICTURE
THE T. V. YEAH
THE S THE TURBO BUTTON
SO RATHER THAN HAVING UH AN EXTRA BUTTON FOR UM FOR THE ON OFF SWITCH YOU JUST USE THE TURBO BUTTON
THIS IS A TELETEXT BUTTON
SO ONCE YOU PRESS THAT THEN YOU GET TELETEXT AND YOU CAN USE THE THE CHANNEL SELECTOR SCROLL WHEEL AS UH
TO NAVIGATE YEAH
YEAH
WELL THEN YOU CAN YOU YOU HAVE LIKE A LITTLE UH NUMBER SELECTION THING
YOU PRESS THE THE THE TELETEXT BUTTON UH TO MOVE BETWEEN UH THE FIELDS AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SCROLL THE NUMBER BACK AND FORTH SO YOU HAVE S YOU GO YOU SCROLL TO SEVEN AND THEN
ZERO ZERO AND THEN YOU CAN UH
WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN PRESS PRESS THE TELETEXT BUTTON AND THEN YOU THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN F
MM UH
AND THIS IS THE UH THE INFRARED UH PORT
ALSO THE TOP OF THE BANANA
SO
AND THEN WE HAVE IN THE UH IN THE BASE STATION WE HAVE THE THE BUTTON AT THE FRONT FOR UH FOR CALLING THE UH THE BANANA
ACTUALLY THEY DO
THAT'S THAT'S YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S FORM AND FUNCTION IN THE ONE IN THE ONE UH OBJECT
YEAH
SO
BUT YEAH THAT'S UM THAT'S JUST LIKE THAT'S AN ATTRACTIVE UM BASE STATION
SO
OKAY
IT'S IT'S UH IT'S ABOUT THE WEIGHT OF A BANANA
YOU KNOW TO GIVE YOU THE CORRECT LOOK AND FEEL
I THINK A CHILD WOULD TRY TO EAT IT ANYWAY SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
CONSIDER THAT
MAYBE HEALTH AND SAFETY ASPECTS
YEAH
I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THE SOLAR CELLS ARE ACTUALLY NECESSARY ANY MORE IF YOU HAVE A RECHARGING BASE STATION
IF I WAS GONNA PLACE THEM I'D PUT THEM ON THE ON THE TOP HERE SINCE THAT'S LIKE UH THE BLACK BIT BUT YEAH I DON'T I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE THE SOLAR CELLS ANYMORE
MM
THE WHAT SORRY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
AH
AH
A LONG TIME
NO NO NO IT CAN IT SHOULD BE WEEKS
YEAH BUT Y PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO PUT IT BACK IN THE BASE STATION ALL THE TIME PEOPLE LEAVE WANNA LEAVE IT ON THE COUCH SO
AH OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
IT SEEMS TO BE FALLING OVER
OR CAN MOVE BETWEEN POSITIONS IN THE IN THE NUMBER
IT'S ALL AUTOMATIC
YEP
UH
YEAH UH FIVE
FIVE MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE SIX IT'S IT'S I GUESS IT'S YEAH
I'D GIVE IT A SIX LIKE I'D I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE HANDY THAN MY CURRENT REMOTE
'CAUSE OF THE SCROLL WHEELS BUT MAYBE LOSES THE POINT FOR NOT HAVING YOU KNOW THE EXTRA BUTTONS WHEN YOU REALL IF YOU DO NEED THEM FOR SOME REASON BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS USE YOUR OTHER
REMOTE
YEAH
WELL IT DEPENDS WHEN YOU SAY FUNCTIONAL DO YOU MEAN IT DOES WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO
OR D DOES WHAT IT DOES YOU KNOW CAN IT MAKE YOU COFFEE
YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S BEFORE
YEAH
I HAVE TO SAY FOUR
WELL IT'S NOT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE
REMEMBER WE'RE FOCUS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FOCUS JUST ON T. V. S
WELL ALL T. V. S BUT ONLY T. ONLY T. V. S I GUESS
FOUR
JUST FOUR
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME OUTLIERS SO
WHICH
I'LL SAY FIVE
YEAH
S YEAH
'CAUSE IT'S FIVE FIVE SEVEN SEVEN SO
UH OKAY DEFINITELY EASY TO USE
SEVEN
ALRIGHT NOW HERE'S THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION WELL TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE EURO QUESTION
WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU GUYS RECKON
HMM
UH
YEAH
YEAH
I'D SAY TWO
I DON'T WANT A BANANA ON MY LIVING ROOM TABLE A BANANA REMOTE
IT IS HANDY IT'S HANDY BUT IT IT'S TERRIBLE
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT A POSITIVE THING
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S HANDY IT'S ERGONOMIC BUT IT'S A BANANA
YEAH BUT IT SAYS I I WOULD BUY THIS SO
NO IT'S I
I WOULD BUY
S S
STILL I I'D SAY TWO
I DON'T THINK I AT ANY STAGE IN MY LIFE I WOULD WANT A BANANA REMOTE CONTROL REALLY
I CAN SAY MAYBE THERE IS A MARKET FOR IT I DUNNO
YEAH
OKAY SO IT DEPENDS IF UH
IF I HAD T IF I HAD TO SPEND TWENTY FIVE EURO
IF THAT WAS LIKE MY LIMIT MAYBE I WOULD BUY IT
BECAUSE THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE EURO REMOTE CONTROLS ARE PROBABLY GONNA LOOK
WORSE THAN A BANANA
AND IT YEAH THIS IS GONNA F YOU KNOW HANDY TO USE
ALTHOUGH IT STILL HAS IT STILL HAS THE WORD OF COURSE AT THE BEGINNING SO I DUNNO
UM
I'D GIVE IT I'D GIVE IT A
I GIVE IT A FOUR NOW
YEAH
I'D SAY THREE I MEAN MY REMOTE CONTROL IS KINDA AT HOME IS PRETTY TERRIBLE
IF IT WAS CHANGE MY REMOTE CONTROL OF MY D. V. D. PLAYER FOR A MANDO BANANA THEN I WOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO BUT UH 'CAUSE IT'S REALLY BAD BUT UH I'D SAY A THREE
IT'S NOT VERY PROMISING BUT YOU KNOW
WE'RE NOT YOUNG TRENDSETTERS
IS THERE SOME SOME FORMULA YOU'RE USING THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO SUM THEM UP
WELL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT THEN
NO
I THINK IT IT KIND OF YOU JUST LOSE INFORMATION IF YOU SUM IT SO
WELL WE DECIDED AGAINST THE SOLAR CELLS SO
YOU MEAN CHARGING IT BY SHAKING THE BANANA
WELL MAYBE DYNAMO IS LIKE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY
YEAH
WELL ACTUALLY THAT THAT NO THAT SAMPLE SPEAKER IS NOT WE WE'RE NOT USING THAT
WE'RE JUST USING THE THE VERY BEEP SIMPLE BEEP THAT S THAT SAMPLE THING IS LIKE THE VOICE RECORDING AND EVERYTHING
SO
YEAH
I SAY THAT
YEAH
MM
WELL WAIT A SECOND NO IT'S IT'S DOUBLE CURVED IT'S GOT A C IT'S UH
WELL D YEAH IT'S MONOTONIC BUT
IT'S GOT BUT IF YOU HOLD IT
IF YOU HOLD IT THAT WAY THAT'S TWO CURVED
ONE ON THIS SIDE ONE ON THAT SIDE BUT THEY'RE OPPOSITE SIDES
THIS IS ACTUALLY I MEAN THIS PROBABLY
THIS PROBABLY ACTUALLY COSTS MORE THAN THREE IF YOU
YEAH
WELL NO DIDN'T WE SAY WE WANTED TO DO A RUBBER
IF YOU DROP IT
WELL WHEN OKAY
WELL WE WE'LL COME BACK WE'LL COME BACK AND SEE IF WE CAN FIT IT IN
YEAH
NO WE HAVE TWO PUSH BUTTONS
HUH
UH
OKAY IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE PLASTIC
IT'S A RECHARGER THING AND UH
WELL I ACTUALLY DID UM
THINK ABOUT IT MYSELF BUT I THOUGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU COULD POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE PUSHING IT DOWN AS YOU SCROLL IT FOR A INSTEAD OF A TURBO BUTTON BUT YOU KNOW THE TURBO BUTTON DOES ADD THAT EXTRA CLASS
YOU KNOW
SO I MEAN IF WE'RE IF WE'RE OVER BUDGET THEN MAYBE WE COULD WE COULD RETHINK THAT
YEAH
NO WE'RE NOT WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR THE BUTTONS
MAKE IT PLASTIC INSTEAD OF RUBBER
AND THEN WE'RE BASICALLY O ON BUDGET EXCEPT FOR YOU KNOW TEN CENTS
YEAH
YEAH WELL PL THE BASE STATION IS MADE OUT OF M MANY UNITS OF PLASTIC
DOES THAT INCLUDE CHARGING CIRCUITRY AND EVERYTHING
SO WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE EXTRA PROFITS
OKAY
THE NEXT FRUIT
NO WE HAVE A PRODUCT WHICH NONE OF US WOULD BUY
NO IT'S PEOPLE IN IN IN MILAN AND UH IN PARIS THAT ARE GONNA BUY IT
WE'RE N YEAH
WE'RE NOT IN MILAN OR PARIS
ACTUALLY THERE WERE A LOT OF
THAT'S 'CAUSE I'M SICK OF MILAN
OKAY SO UM PROJECT PROCESS
YEAH
I DUNNO I THINK WE HAD A FAIR BIT OF CREATIVITY
AND UH BUT I THINK ONE THING WE M MISSED OUT OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS WAS A UM LIKE A FOCUS GROUP WITH THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WE'RE TARGETING
WE NEEDED SOME OF THESE KIND OF YOUNG TRENDSETTERS TO COME IN AND PLAY WITH THE BANANA AND YOU KNOW SEE IF THEY
SEE IF THEY LIKE IT
BECAUSE YEAH THE EVALUATION FOR US IS IS KIND OF
POINTLESS
YEAH
BECAUSE IT IT WOULD ALSO BE INTERESTING TO UH YOU TO KNOW FIND OUT IF WE HAVE A MARKET IN REALLY YOUNG CHILDREN AS WELL
TO SEE YOU KNOW HOW TO HOW TO MARKET THIS THING
'CAUSE YOU KNOW IF WELL I MEAN MAYBE YOU DON'T WANNA GIVE ALL YOUR KIDS THEIR OWN REMOTE BECAUSE THEY'LL BE CHANGING THE CHANNEL ALL THE TIME BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE IN SOME HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THERE IS YOU KNOW A T. V. FOR EACH KID
THEN YOU KNOW BANANA REMOTE CONTROL COULD BE FUN FOR THEM AS WELL
MIGHT HAVE TO DRAW A FACE ON IT
SO BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TO WORK ON NEXT TIME IS REALLY FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THE TARGET
MARKET
YEAH
I THINK THERE ARE WAYS WE COULD MAYBE SIMPLIFY THE
WELL JUST THE THE THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT WE'RE USING INSIDE I'M NOT SURE REALLY HOW COMPLICATED OUR UM
OUR NEEDS ARE
I MEAN ALL WE HAVE IS TWO PUSH BUTTONS AND TWO SCROLLERS DO WE REALLY NEED AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TO
YOU KNOW TO PROCESS THAT
AND ALSO FO YOU KNOW FOR MOOD LIGHTING AND AND STUFF THAT WOULD BE RATHER COOL
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IN VERSION TWO
IS THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW TO CONTROL THINGS OTHER THAN THE T. V. AND NOT JUST ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT BUT YOU KNOW THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT OF THE ROOM
YEP
OKAY
THANK YOU
OKAY SO WE CAN GO TO THE SLIDES
YEAH
NUMBER THREE
OH NUMBER TWO SORRY
SO FINAL DESIGN
FINAL DESIGN
OKAY SO
MICHAEL YOU CAN GO AHEAD
YOU CAN PULL IT OUT FIRST MAYBE
UH
AND WE WE DO HAVE ONE MORE FUNCTIONALITY
IF YOU TAKE THE BANANA AS SUCH AND UH YOU PRESS THE TURBO BUTTON SO IT SWITCH ONS THE SWITCH ONS THE T. V.
THE TURBO BUTTON
ADDITIONAL BUTTON
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
SO THEN THEN BOTH THE SCROLL BUTTONS THEY ARE FOR TELETEXT BROWSING
AND YOU CAN TELE YEAH ONCE YOU PRESS THE TELETEXT BUTTON THEN THE SCROLL BUTTONS THEY ARE MORE FOR TELETEXT
THEY ARE NO MORE FOR CHANNEL OR VOL VOLUME
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT ALWAYS MEANS WHATEVER THE RAYS GOES BY THEY THEY GET REFLECTED AND THEN YOU ARE HAVING A BETTER COVERAGE
IT'S LIKE ANTENNAS
AND FOR THE POWER SOURCE WE ARE HAVING SOLAR CELLS AND RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES AND THIS AND UH THE BASIS STATION IS GOING TO HAVE THE INPUT FROM THE MM POWER LINE FOR FOR CHARGING THE BATTERIES
IT IS VERY LIGHT
YEAH
AND WE HAVE PUT THESE DIFFERENT COLOURS SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T MISTAKE THEM MISTAKE IT AS A BANANA
OTHERWISE IT'S YOU KNOW A CHILD COMES AND SO
YEAH
MM-HMM
OH WE DIDN'T THINK OF THAT YET
YEAH
OH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
MM-HMM MM-HMM
IT'LL IT'LL BE ALWAYS AT TOP SOMEWHERE AT THERE
YEAH BECAUSE NOW WE ARE HAVING RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES SO THAT THAT IS
EIGHT TO TEN EIGHT TO TEN HOURS
N MOST NO MOST OF THE TIME IT'S NOT BEING USED
SO WHEN WHEN YOU ARE MAKING IT ON
MM
MM-HMM
NO EIGHT OR EIGHT OR TEN HOURS OF WORKING
IF YOU ARE JUST LEAVING LIKE THAT IT'LL BE MUCH LONGER
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
AND WE ARE HAVING THE SPEAKERS REGULAR CHIP FOR CONTROL
PRICING IS WAS A FACTOR SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE GONE FOR A REGULAR CHIP ONLY NOT THE ADVANCED CHIP
AND UH THAT'S IT
THAT'S RIGHT
YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS
YOU ARE NOT CONVINCED
NOT NOT MANY WE WE WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
SO THAT THIS BUTTON FO IS FOR TELETEXT WHICH IS USUALLY ALSO THE CASE
THAT USUALLY THERE IS A TELETEXT BUTTON AND ONCE YOU PRESS THAT THE CHANNEL BUTTONS THEY BACO BECOME THE SCROLLING BUTTONS
IT'S UP TO YOU MEANS
NOW THAT
MEANS LET'S SAY THIS THIS CAN MOVE THE THE LARGER DIGITS AND THIS CAN MOVE THE SMALLER DIGITS
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
SO THERE WAS THERE WAS A CONSTRAINT THAT THE SURFACE AREA WHICH WE HAVE ON THIS BANANA ON ONE SIDE BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE
SO WE ARE TARGETING A SEGMENT WHICH IS WHICH IS JUST VERY TRENDY KIND OF THING THEY THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BUTTONS ANY MORE
AND ANYWAY
EVALUA YEAH
WHY THIS STRANGE FACTOR OF SEVEN
USUALLY I HAVE SEEN THAT SCALES ARE FROM ONE TO TEN
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY FINE GOT THE IDEA
OKAY
OKAY OKAY GREAT
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
GO AHEAD
MM-HMM
SURE
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU CAN SAY FANCY
HANDY
HANDY
YEAH IT'S FANCY ACCORDING TO ME
SEVEN
SEVEN BY ME
OKAY
SO YOU CAN ADD SEVEN PLUS SIX PLUS SEVEN PLUS
FIVE
AGAIN I'LL GIVE SEVEN
YEP
SEVEN FOR ME
I'LL GIVE FIVE
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
THE STANDARDS
WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET OFF THE SHELF
WE
FIVE
SO FOUR POINT TWO
FOUR
THERE I'LL GIVE IT SEVEN
THAT'S RIGHT
FOR A T. V. THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE WHICH I FELT WAS THE LOCATOR WHICH IS A COOL FEATURE
AND THEN THE SCROLL BUTTONS ARE AGAIN COOL FEATURES
WE DON'T HAVE L. C. D. FOR IT BUT
THAT WE DECIDED WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE
MM-HMM
SEVEN
OKAY
DEFINITELY SEVEN
OKAY
I'LL SAY FIVE
I'LL SAY FIVE
WHY
NO BUT IT'S REALLY HANDY ACTUALLY IF YOU SEE
IT'S IT'S SO HANDY
AND THEN
ANYB ANYBODY WHO COMES HERE ANYBODY WHO COMES TO YOUR HOME HE'LL AT LEAST ASK ONCE WHAT IS THIS
IT'S A VERY POSITIVE THING IF YOU SEE LIKE THAT
YOUNGSTERS
YOU WANT TO FLAUNT
YOU WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND OR SOMETHING
OR MIGHT BE IT DOES SOME OTHER KIND OF THING BUT
UH YEAH CRAZY
I SAY FIVE
AND YOU HAVE SAVED IT
YOU'LL HAVE TO RELOAD
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS
AND THEY THEY MIGHT NOT BE A AS EASY AS THIS YEAH
YEAH
S
I GO SLIGHTLY UP
SIX
SIX FIVE FOUR
OKAY
I'LL STILL GIVE IT FIVE
YEAH
SO IT'S SOMEWHERE THREE POINT FIVE I THINK
NO I SAID FIVE
MM-HMM
OOPS
YEAH IT'S IT'S FUNNY
YEAH SURE
MM-HMM
SOLAR CELLS YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH WE SAID NO TO THAT
I THINK RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES WILL TAKE CARE OF THE POWER THING
YEAH
TO BRING THE COST
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO WE HAVE THE REGULAR CHIP ON THE PRINT WHICH IS ONE
AND THAT'S IT
AND WE HAVE SAMPLE SPEAKER
YEAH
YEAH
THE COST OF THAT IS VERY HIGH
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND WE HAVE SEV
YEAH
SO WE WE'LL PUT SOME EXTRAS IF THERE IS SOMETHING
OKAY
TO REDUCE THE COST IT'S OKAY
OH IT'S GOT ALL THE DIRECTIONS SO DON'T WORRY
IT'S GOT A DIRECTION
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PUSH BUTTONS
NO THAT IS A SCROLL WHEEL ITSELF IT'LL BE PUT IN THAT
AH OKAY OKAY
OKAY OKAY
YEAH
NO
THERE'S NO CHIP THERE
IT JUST EMITS THE SIGNAL
AND THE RECEIVER ACCEPTS IT AND THAT'S IT
JUST SE SENDS THE SIGNAL THAT'S IT
YEP
NO
YEAH
SO FIRST THING WHICH WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IS
INSTEAD OF RUBBER LET IT BE PLASTIC
AND UH THAT MUCH MONEY WILL BE REQUIRED FOR THE BASE STATION WHICH IS NOT THERE
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
SO MIGHT BE NINETY CENTIMES FOR THE THE REMAINING THINGS WHICH THE CORD AND EVERYTHING WHICH'LL GO
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
S
DETACHABLE BATTERY
THEY LIKE THAT
MM-HMM
BIASED
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
THE COST OF THE THING CAN BE MADE MORE THAN MIGHT BE
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST THE OPTIMAL WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR THE COST WHICH WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
INTERFACE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
INTEGRATE
MM-HMM
SO
WHAT ELSE
OKAY
HOME
HAPPILY SATISFIED
MM-HMM
THANK YOU
WHAT THIS BUTTON FOR
OKAY
BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO TO PAGE SEVEN HUNDRED
HOW MAN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
CAN YOU REPEAT IT
YEAH
AH OKAY OKAY
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
OKAY
I SEE
I SEE
OKAY
OKAY
IS IT REALLY WEIGHT
IS IT LIGHT OR
OKAY
OKAY
OK
OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH I SEE
I UNDER I UNDERSTAND
HOW LONG THE HOW LONG THE BIT THE BATTERIES LONG
I L YEAH
I LIKE I LIKE IT
MAYBE THE THE THING THAT CONVINCE ME THE LESS IS THE THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL BUTTONS
LOOKS A BIT
LOOKS A BIT PUZZLED UH I DUNNO HOW TO SAY THAT
YOU THE THE B THE BUTTONS CHANGE H H THEIR FUNCTION DEPENDING IF Y IT'S TELETEXT OR NOT
AND THE VOLUME BUTTON WILL WILL BECOME
AND WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE DIGITS
BUTTO REAL BUTTONS
OKAY
BECAUSE HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT CONFIGURATION AND ALL THIS KIND OF UH STUFF
IT'S ALL AUTOMATIC
OKAY
OKAY YEAH IT'S FINE
W WE ARE LIVING IN A WONDERFUL WORLD
AUTOMATICALLY CONFIGURE
YEAH
S
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
I I CONST I CONSTRUCTED A A LIST OF CRITERIA BASED ON THE ON THE GENERAL USER REQUIREMENTS
AND EACH CRITERIA IS WILL BE EVALUATED IT'S UH LOGICAL CRITERIA SO WE MUST
USERS MUST SAY I IF IT'S TRUE OR IS OR IF IT'S FALSE IN A IN A SCALE RANGING FROM ZERO TO SEVEN
BECAUSE I
I'M SORRY
SORRY
AH YEAH
IT'S FROM SORRY IT'S FROM ONE TO SEVEN
IT'S FROM FROM ONE TO SEVEN SORRY
BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE AN EVEN
IT SHOULD BE AN EVEN UH SCALE AND FIVE
IS TOO SHORT AND NINE IS TOO LONG
I'M A I I'M
SORRY
YEAH YEAH
THE VARIANCE IS MI IT'S IS MINIMAL
I'M UM ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION
OKAY
AND THAT'S THE CRITERIA I I FOUND MORE USEFUL
I THINK I SH I I COULD WRITE THE CRITERIA IN THE ON THE WHITEBOARD
AND WE ALL FOUR COULD RANGE
COULD EVALUATE THE
OKAY LET'S LET'S EVALUATE IF IT'S FANCY OR
SEVEN BUT
I WOULD SAY SEVEN
IT'S QUITE FANCY
SIX
SIX
I WOULD SAY
EVERYTHING AR
MM EVERYTHING
IT'S COMPARED TO THE ALL
REMOTE CONTROLS
ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE THE R THE REAL SPECIFICATION OF A OF A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTRO
AH IT'S NOT AN UNIVER BUT IT'S FOR ALL KIND OF T. V. S
YEAH
FOUR
FOUR
SO FOUR
IT MEANS COOL FEATURES LIKE
NEW FEATURES ACTUALLY
I WOULD SAY FIVE
YOU SAID SEVEN
FIVE
SORRY I HAVE THEM
OF COUR OF COURSE THE MOST DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR THE END
I FIND IT QUITE CHEAP ACTUALLY
I DUNNO
IF I I IT DEPENDS IF YOU LIVE IN IN SWITZERLAND OR YOU LIVE IN
I DON'T KNOW
WHA THE INITIAL SPECIFICATIONS WERE FOR THE WHOLE ALL EUROPE OR
YEAH THIS IS THE THE INITIAL SPECIFICATIONS
I WOULD SAY SIX
IT'S QUITE CHEAP ACTUALLY
ACTUALLY MAYBE
YEAH
I CHANGE THE QUESTION
SO YEAH UPLOAD THE
YEAH IT'S TWO DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
IF YOU REALLY NEED AN UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL OR IF YOU
WOULD CHANGE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL FOR A N FOR A NEW ONE
SO
WHAT NOW
WHAT RANGE
SIX
SIX
SIX
SIX SO IT'S UH FIVE POINT FIVE OR LESS
ACTUALLY YEAH I WE
FIVE
YOU ARE ROMANTIC REALLY
I WOULD SAY TWO
WHO IS THE OUTLIER
WH WH YOU SAID FIVE
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A
NO BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE YEAH WE SHOULDN'T SUM LIKE THAT
BECAUSE THE THE LAST TWO QUESTIONS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REST ACTUALLY
OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T WE WILL NOT SELL
UH NO I DIDN'T ANYTHING
YEAH THE UH
YEAH
DO YOU WANT ME TO SUM O I THINK IT'S NOT
S
ACTUALLY WHAT'S THE DIFFEREN
TOO EXPENSIVE
ACTUALLY WHE WHE WHEN YOU WROTE REGULAR CHIP YOU SHOULD PUT TWO BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER CHIP HERE
YEAH BUT
YOU NEED
FO I IT DOES NOTHING ACTUALLY
OKAY SO NOW WE HAVE A PRODUCT WHICH NOBODY WOULD WOULD BUY
WOULD YEAH WOULD BUY
YEAH BECAUSE TH TH THE EVALUATION PROJECT
AH WOULD BUY YEAH
MASSIVELY YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UH YOU HAVE BEEN IN MILAN A COUPLE OF TIMES SO
AND YOU SAID THE LOWEST
YEAH FOR THE BATTERIES
MM-HMM
SO MORE GENERAL REMOTE CONTROL INSTEAD OF JUST FOCUSING ON UH ON T. V.
THE COMPLEXITY SHOULDN'T BE MUCH HIGHER
FOR YOU SAID IF IT GOOD FOR D. V. D. THEN I WOULD
BYE
'KAY HELLO EVERYBODY
UH I GUESS YOU ALL KNOW WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU ALL RECEIVED THE EMAIL I GUESS
UH WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING THIS MEETING TO START A NEW PROJECT WHICH IS ABOUT DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL
SO I'M GOING TO BE THE PROJECT MANAGER OF THIS UH PROJECT
AND UH SO I'M PRESENT MYSELF
I'M FABIEN CARDINAUX AND UH I I GUESS YOU CAN PRESENT YOURSELF
SO I DUNNO YOU CAN STARTS
OKAY
AND YOU ARE
IN THE PROJECT
SO UH SO TODAY WE ARE DOING A SHORT MEETING TO PRESENT THE PROJECT SO UM
WE ARE GOODING WE ARE GOING TO PRESENT THE TOOL WE ARE WE ARE GOING TO USE DURING ALL THIS PROJECT
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PROJECT PLAN AND WE ARE GOING TO TO DISCUSS ABOUT ST OUR FIRST IDEAS AND SO ON AND YEAH
SO WE HAVE AROUND TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO DO THIS MEETING
UM
SO WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT
IS TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT SHOULD BE OF COURSE NEW AND ORIGINAL AND UM IT SHOULD BE TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
THAT MEAN IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING PROJECT AND UH
UH
SO W IT'S WE WILL TRY TO DO OUR BEST AND HOPEFULLY COME WITH SOMETHING VERY NEW AND THAT
PEOPLE WANT TO BUY
SO UM
SO WHAT'S UH WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO DURING THIS ALL THIS PROJECT
SO IT'S MORE LIKE WE ARE GOING TO DO INV INDIVIDUAL WORK ALL IN O IN O OUR SPECIALITIES AND WE ARE GOING TO MEET EACH OTHER QUITE OFTEN TO DISCUSS AND TO FIND A GOOD WAY
UM
YEAH AND EVERYTHING IS WILL BE LIKE THIS
UM SO NOW WE ARE GOING TO TO GET USED T TO TO THE TOOLS WE ARE GOING TO USE ALL DURING ALL THIS PROJECT
SO WE CAN TRY TO USE UH THE WHITEBOARD HERE
SO UH
FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN TRY TO WRITE WHAT IS OUR OUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND WRITE THE F OUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT IT
MM
UH
SO UH
SO I WILL ASK YOU ALL TO DO THE SAME
JUST TO GET USED TO THE WHITEBOARD
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN DRAW THE PICTURE OF COURSE
OH
NEVER MIND
YEAH
NO WORRY
YOU CAN DRAW IT IF YOU WANT
GOOD
SO GOOD UM SO LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY
UH WE ARE GOING TO TO SELL WE WANT TO SELL UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO EURO
AND UH OUR EXPECTED PROFIT WILL BE AROUND FIFTY MILLION EURO
AND UH WE ARE TRYING TO TO HAVE A MARKET ALL AROUND THE WORLD
SO N NOT ONLY FOR SWITZERLAND BUT FOR THE WORLD
UH
SO UM
THE WE EXPECT A PRODUCTION COST OF MAXIMUM
UH TWELVE POINT FIFTY EURO
YEAH OF COURSE
UM SO WE CAN START TODAY TO HAVE A FIRST IDEA OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHAT ARE OUR EXPERIMENTS WITH REMOTE CONTROL AND ANY IDEA
SO IF YOU HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE GOOD OR BAD WITH REMOTE CONTROLS YOU CAN SHARE IT AND SAY WHAT YOU F WHAT IS YOUR IDEA
ANYTHING
MM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
ARE YOU NOT AFRAID THAT IF YOU TAKE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN MOVE THE SLIDE AND IT COULD THE THE VOLUME CAN GO UP VERY QUICKLY AND IT CAN
YEAH ALSO IF Y WHEN YOU TAKE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE ON THE TABLE
YOU TAKE IT AND YOU PUSH THE BUTTON AND EVERYTHING IS VERY LOUD AND
YOU HAVE A HEART ATTACK
OKAY
YEAH SO YOU CAN DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH WITHOUT OBSTACLES AND
OKAY
LET'S CONTINUE
I HAVE A MEETING IN FIVE MINUTES SO MAYBE WE SHOULD HURRY
UM
SO WE WILL CLOSE UH THIS MEETING
SO WE WILL HAVE A NEXT MEETING IN UH THIRTY MINUTES
UM
UH
THE SO I WILL ASK YOU TO DO SOME WORK
UH THE THE INTERFACE INTERFACE DEVELOPER WILL WORK ON THE ON THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL START TO TO HAVE NEW IDEA AND
READ ABOUT YEAH
OH
INDUSTRY AND OH
YEAH
SO UM
FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER WHICH IS HAMED UM
UH YOU ARE GOING TO WORK ON THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND FOR THE MARKETING UH
MANAGER I DUNNO OKAY WHICH IS BOB UH
YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO TO FIND THE USER REQUIREMENTS F UH FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM YOU WILL RECEIVE BY EMAIL UH THE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AND UH BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
YEP FINISHED
SO I SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
THANK YOU
NOW WHAT
OKAY SO MY NAME IS PETRE
YOU CAN CALL ME PETRE OR PETER IF YOU LIKE
I DON'T CARE
UH IN THE PROJECT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE TECHNIC
BOB OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO PROBABLY I WOULD TRY TO TRY TO DRAW THE ANIMAL
WELL SH SHOULD I DRAW THE PICTURE OF THE ANIMAL
I I TH I THINK I SHOULD
OKAY SO
UM
OKAY AMERICAN UM
UM
I WOULD USE THE BIRD
SO I TRIED TO SKETCH IT OUT
I HAD TO FIRST UH WRITE IT DOWN BECAUSE I AM NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE IF I CAN DRAW IT BUT AH
CAN YOU RECOGNISE IT AS A BIRD
OKAY IT'S YOUR TURN TO
OH IT'S OKAY
YEAH
I SHOULD GET USED TO THE TOOL SO
OH JUST WAIT A LITTLE BIT
C COULD WE PUT IT HERE TO MAKE IT AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE
AH PROBABLY NOT
OKAY IT IT WORKS LIKE THIS
ARE YOU LEFT HANDED
OH PITY
AH IT'S MAYBE BETTER IF YOU LEAVE IT
YOU WON'T DRAW THEM OR
JUST TRY
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
NO I THINK IT'S CLEAR
IT'S OKAY
IT'S IN IT'S INDEED BEAUTIFUL
OKAY
BOB
HAVE TO REMEMBER IT
BOB
PER UNIT I GUESS
Y OH OKAY
OKAY
OH
OKAY I HAVE ALSO SOME POINTS UH
MAYBE TWO POINTS
UH FIRST WOULD BE THAT IN CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THERE IS NO BACK LIGHT
SO IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE UH PLAYING WITH THIS IN THE DARK ROOM IT'S IT'S PROBABLY WORTH TO TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE UH BACK LIGHT
AND MAYBE IT COULD BE ALSO DEPENDANT ON THE THE AMOUNT OF OF LIGHT IN THE ROOM
SO THAT IF IF IT'S IN THE DAY IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE BACK LIGHTED BECAUSE IT WORKS ON THE BATTERY SO
SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AND THE SECOND THING F SECOND POINT FROM ME WOULD BE THAT IN A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL THERE IS UH THERE ARE TWO BUTTONS FOR VOLUME CONTROL
BUT I PREFER LIKE A POTENTIAL METER OR SOMETHING LIKE
YOU KNOW SOME SLIDER OR NOT JUST TWO DISCRETE BUTTONS FOR VOLUME BUT SOMETHING WHICH
YEAH BUT I CAN REACH IN UH ONE SECOND I CAN MUTE IT DOWN OR OR MAKE A HIGH VOLUME
AH N
IF IT DROPS TO THE FLOOR THEN IT STARTS TO SCREAM
YEAH F IT DEPENDS WHAT WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT
YEAH BUT WE CAN WE CAN THINK OF THESE THINGS AFTERWARDS BUT IF YOU HAVE SOME MORE NOTES ON THAT
OKAY
UM
OKAY JUST A SECOND
WHICH I WHICH IS HAMED
OKAY
UH I AM THE TECHNICAL DESIGNER I DUNNO WHICH ONE UH V
USER INTERF OKAY
OKAY SO I'M THE FIRST ONE
I SEE
SIGN
OKAY
UH
MY NAME IS HAMED GETABDAR AND UH I'M GOING TO BE INTERFACE DESIGNER IN THIS PROJECT
I DUNNO IF I SHOULD GO WITH THIS
IF IT IS ENOUGH LINE
I'M SORRY
OKAY
THEY SHOULD BE REMOTE
OKAY THANKS
NO
OKAY
SHOULD I CLEAN
OKAY I THINK LIKE HORSES UH BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL SO IF I WANT TO WRITE IT HERE I THINK I CAN
OH
OKAY
I DUNNO IF I CAN
OKAY
IT MAY BE LIKE A COW OR I DUNNO WHATEVER
I'M NOT GOOD VERY GOOD IN DRAWING
OKAY SO THIS IS VERY IT'S A BIRD I THINK
I DUNNO WHAT IS IT
FOUR
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
I'M SHAMEFUL YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
UH I YEAH JUST A SIMPLE EXPERIENCE
I UH I PREFER UM REMOTE CONTROL WORKING WITH RADIO WAVES
BECAUSE REMOTE CONTROL WORKING WITH INFRA RED RAYS YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD KEEP IT IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION AND THEN TRY IT HARD TO TUNE
MM
YEAH
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY THANKS
BYE
UH MY NAME'S BOB MOR
OH SORRY
'KAY
SO MY NAME'S BOB MORRIS
I'M THE MARKETING EXPERT FOR THIS PROJECT
BOB YEAH
YEAH GO AHEAD
OKAY OKAY
SO I THINK MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL WOULD BE A C A CAT
THAT'S ITS HEAD
UM I PROBABLY LIKE CATS THE MOST BECAUSE THEY'RE CUDDLY AND FURRY AND UH PLAYFUL
OKAY
THANKS
MAYBE PUT IT UP PUT IT A MAYBE PUT IT ON THE DESK OR SOMETHING
UH THAT'S BETTER
YOUR LAPEL MICROPHONE'S FALLEN OFF
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CONTINUE
YEAH DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
NO
OH THAT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD
YEAH AND STRONG
WELL FROM EXPERIENCE UM I'VE HAD REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE PAST THAT HAVE HAD VERY THEY'VE HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF BUTTONS AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY SMALL
AND IT'S BEEN VERY HARD TO TO TO USE
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY BUTTONS AND YOU KNOW IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE WHICH BUTTONS DO WHAT AND THE BUTTONS ARE VERY SMALL AND VERY HARD TO PRESS
UM AND AND NORMALLY YOU ONLY EVERY USE YOU KNOW ON A T. V. REMOTE YOU ONLY EVER USE
MOSTLY YOU KNOW F FOUR OR F SIX BUTTONS
UM
SO IT'S FRUSTRATED ME IN THE PAST TH THAT
AH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY N
IS THAT BECAUSE THE OF THE DISCRETE VOLUME LEVELS OR IS THAT
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
HE'S THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
NO YOU'RE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST
I. D.
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
AND THEN LAST ONE'S MARKETING WHICH IS ME
GREAT OKAY
THANKS GUYS
BYE
SO UM NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
UH
SO UH
TOD UH FOR THIS MEETING I WILL TAKE THE NOTES AND DO THE MINUTES
UH SO WE WILL SEE OUR THREE PRESENTATIONS
UM WE WILL START WITH THE UH MANAGER EXPERT WI WHO WILL TALK ABOUT UH USER RE REQUIREMENTS WHATS USER NEEDS AND WHAT IT DESIRE FOR THIS DEVI DEVICE
YEP
OH I DON'T THINK SO
I THINK YOU HAVE TO COME HERE
I DUNNO
I THINK IT SHOULD STAY
SHOULD STAY IN THE SQUARE HERE
OH MAYBE
OH YOU CAN PUT IT HERE
OH THAT'S OKAY IT'S JUS
HMM
THANK YOU
SO UM
MAYBE NOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT A USER INTERFACE AND UH ABOUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION OF THIS DEVICE
SO UH PET PETER CAN YOU TALK SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
NO
AH
SORRY I'M SORRY
SORRY
YEAH IT'S STILL BOB MORRIS
YEAH YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT YES
CLICK ON YES
YEAH
SO CAN WE USE ANY ANY FREQUENCY
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY FREQUENCY
OKAY
AND WHAT HAPPEN WITH UH RADIO WAVES WHEN TWO NEIGHBOURS HAVE THE SAME HAVE OUR REMOTE CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE
AND SO DO THEY HAVE THE SAME FREQUENCY OR
OKAY
A KIND OF IDENTIFICATION OKAY
SO
YEAH
SO
OKAY
HMM
OKAY
SO MAYBE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE FUNCTION AND
OPEN
SLIDE SHOW
IT SHOULD WORK SO YOU CAN
MM
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE PRICE IT WOULD BE OUT OF RANGE
OR IT WOULD BE MAYBE FEASIBLE
OKAY
MM
WHY
BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLER
YEAH
MM
OKAY
IT'S A A PRICE MATTER
YEAH
MM
OKAY
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I OH
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW
YOU KNOW WHERE
WE WANT TO
TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW AND SO WE I THINK WE SHOULD STILL THINKING ABOUT IT
BUT MAYBE
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY THANK YOU PETER
SO UM I HAVE TO INFORM YOU I RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM THE MANAGEMENT BON BOARD TODAY AND THEY HAVE NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM
FIRST UM THEY SAY THAT'S UH ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT T TELETEXT
UH APPARENTLY IT BECOMES FROM ACCORDING TO THEM IT BECOMES OUT OF DATE
OUT DATED
AND UH
BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET POPULARITY AND EVERYBODY HAS INTERNET AT HOME AND
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT USEFUL TO HAVE TELETEXT
UM
SO I THINK WE CAN AVOID THE TELETEXT
UM THE SECOND THING IS UH
THEY SUGGEST THAT THAT WE SHOULD UH USE THE REMOTE CONTROL ONLY FOR T. V. NOT FOR D. V. D. AND OTHER DEVICES
BECAUSE IT MAKE IT IT MAKES IT'S TOO COMPLEX AND UH BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT MUCH TIME FOR THIS PROJECT WE SHOULD STAY ON T. V. ON THE ONLY SPECIFIC T. V. REMOTE CONTROL
THE THIRD THE THIRD ONE IS UH ABOUT THE THE THE IMAGE OF THE COMPANY
SO UM UH WE SHOULD WE SHOULD KEEP UH THE THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECOGNISABLE
UH UH
IT'S THAT MEAN WE SHOULD USE THE COLOUR OF OUR COMPANY AND MAYBE PUT SOMEWHERE THE S THE SLOGAN OF THE COMPANY
WHICH IS UH WE PUT FASHION OF IN ELECTRONICS
SO WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL THEY SHOULD SAY OH IT'S FROM REAL REACTION AND HE S THEY SHOULD RECOGNISE THE COMPANY
SO UM
SO NOW WE WE SHOULD TAKE THE DECISION WHAT WE ARE GOING TO WHAT FUNCTION WE WILL HAVE ON THIS UH ON THIS REMOTE CONTROL
SO MM ARE WE GOING TO USE L. C. D. SPEECH RECOGNITION
UH
YEAH
MAYBE MAYBE
YEAH BUT FIRST MAYBE WHAT IS WHAT ARE THE USUAL FUNCTION OF A STANDARD REMOTE CONTROL
I MEAN
WHAT DO
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK WE SHOULD STICK ON VERY USEFUL FUNCTIONS BECAUSE WE WANT LESS BUTTON
SO YEAH
SO TURNING CHANNEL OF COURSE
VOLUME SETTING
YEAH
I THINK IT WOULD BE A B
YEAH
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE MORE AND MORE CHANNELS AND IF YOU WANT TO PASS THROUGH ALL THE CHANNELS TO GET THE CHANNEL YOU WANT IT'S
MAYBE MAYBE WE COULD THINK OF SOMETHING MORE BETWEENS LIKE
UH
YEAH
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH
MAYBE OH I DON'T KNOW
OH
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE KEY BUTTONS LIKE UH DISCOVERY CHANNE LIKE DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL AND MOVIES CHANNEL AND
AND INSIDE THIS THIS THING YOU CAN MOVE MAYBE SWITCH
IF YOU WANT TO SEE A MOVIE YOU CLICK ON THE MOVIE BUTTON SO YOU HAVE ALL THE MOVIE CHANNELS AND AFTER YOU'VE YOU PLUS PLUS PLUS
I IT JUST AN IDEA
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT BUT
YEAH PROBABLY YEAH YEAH
OKAY
ANYTHING ELSE
YEAH
YEAH
WHAT ABOUT THE SETTINGS OF THE T. V.
BECAUSE IT'S BUTTON WE DON'T USE VERY OFTEN BUT
IT'S WE NEED IT ANYWAY
SO
YEAH YEAH
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO TO WATCH SOMETHING ON T. V.
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THE SETTINGS
BECAUSE SETTINGS IF WE WANT TO DO SETTINGS WE NEED BUTTONS FOR THAT AND WE WANT LESS BUTTONS SO
MAYBE WITH THE L. C. D. WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH LESS BUTTONS BUT
MM
YEAH
OH YEAH
OH THE
YEAH
YEAH
WE SHOULD HIDE THEM SOMEWHERE
IN THE MENUS OF THE L. C. D. OR IN THE BACK OF THE REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT'S IT'S A KIND OF SETTING I THINK
IT SHOULD FIT IN THOSE SETTINGS FUNCTIONS
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A VERY CURRENT USEFUL FUNCTION
NO I THINK IT'S AFTER AFTER FIVE MINUTES OR SOMETHING A TIMER I I THINK NO
OH OKAY YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO S YEAH
YEAH
ON THE BACK OR
FOR WHAT
AH OH YEAH YEAH
YEAH A BUTTON YEAH I GUESS SO
SO ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS OR FUNCTIONS
YEAH WE HAVE STILL ONE OR TWO MINUTES TO TALK YEAH
USUALLY IT'S ALREADY ON T. V. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IF WE IF WE ADD THE TIME WE HAVE TO HAVE MAYBE A BIGGER DISPLAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IS IT VERY USEFUL
I MEAN ARE USERS WANTS TO HAVE THE TIME ON THE ON THE REMOTE
THIS IS THE QUESTION
IS IT USEFUL
W IN MY OPINION WE SHOULD HAVE ONLY USEFUL THING AND BECAUSE APPARENTLY THEY WANT THE SIMPLER IT'S IS BETTER
NO TIME ON
I THINK
YEAH
SO MAYBE WE THINK WE CAN THINK MORE ABOUT THAT AND DISCUSS THAT MAYBE LAST TIME NEXT TIME
AND UH YEAH NOW THE MEETING ROOM IS BUSY
SOMEBODY BOOKED THE MEETING ROOM JUST FOR AT ONE P. M. AND SO WE SHOULD LEAVE
UH
SO UM
SO NOW WE ARE GOING FOR FOR A SMALL LUNCH
IT'S UH FUNDED BY THE COMPANY
AND UH AFTER WE HAVE UH THIRTEEN MINUTES TO TO DO INDEVEL INDIVIDUAL WORKS
AND UH I WILL DO THE MINUTES
AND UH
YOU ARE GOING TO WORK ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL WORKS
AND UH YOU WILL RECEIVE AS USUAL YOUR SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION AND SO ON
THANK YOU EVERYBODY
YEAH THAT'S IT
WELL OKAY YEAH
YEAH BUT THE USER USER INTERFACE IS RESPONSIBLE
OKAY SO
YOU'RE SCARING ME WITH L. C. D. MAN
AND SPEECH RECOGNITION IN REMOTE UNIT IT WILL BE VERY E EXPENSIVE
YEAH
YEAH
AT LEAST WE HAVE COUPLE OF MONTHS T TO WORK ON IT SO SO IT WILL BE CHEAPER FINALLY
BECAUSE YOU CANCELLED IT
YEAH
YEP
YOU STILL WANT ME THE PRESENTATION
YEAH IT SHOULD BE OKAY
YEAH F UH I KNOW ABOUT THIS SINCE IT'S MY IT'S EXACTLY MY FIELD SO
IT'S UH KIND OF HANDSHAKING UH
WHEN STARTING TO UH WHEN YOU START TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE YOUR T. V. THEN THEN IT'S LIKE AN HANDSHAKING PROTOCOL WITH YOUR YOUR REMOTE
SO SO IF TWO TWO DEVICES ARE TRYING TO GO TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE T. V. SET THEN THE THE THE ONE WHICH HAS THE MORE ENERGY IN THE WAVE IS CHOSEN
WELL IT CAN BE A PROBLEM SOMETIMES BUT MOST OF THE TIME IT WORKS OKAY
YEAH BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK UH ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THINK AS A FUNCTION DESIGNER THAT WE WILL USE THE ALREADY MADE UH CIRCUITS WHICH WE PROBABLY BU BUY
IT'S WORTH TO BUY
AND THEY HAVE THESE PROBLEMS SOLVED SO
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE
YES
I HAVE ONLY A COUPLE OF THINGS BECAUSE I HAD I STRUGGLED A BIT WITH THE SOFTWARE THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO USE IN THIS UH
UH
IN THIS COMPANY
I WAS USED TO USE LINUX BEFORE SO
BUT I TRIED TO
TRIED TO BREAK THROUGH THIS TOO I GUESS
MM
AH
OKAY
HOW TO MAKE IT BIG
SLIDE SHOW
OKAY THANKS
OKAY
OH SO I WILL SPEAK ABOUT WORKING DESIGN
THAT'S THE FIRST SLIDE
UH WHAT UH I HAVE TO DO
A LOOK AT WHAT THE OTHER COMPANY OKAY SO UH PRESENTLY I AM LOOKING WHAT IS POSSIBLE TO USE
WHAT CIRCUITS TO USE AND STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE UH I DIDN'T WORK UH WITH THESE UH CIRCUITS SO FAR SO I HAVE TO LOOK WHAT WHAT IS A V A V AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET FOR FOR THE COMMUNICATION FOR THE I. R. CIRCUITS AND SO ON
SO I'M CURRENTLY LOOKING WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE WEB
AND UH I WANTED TO ASK YOU M MAYBE AFTERWARDS AFTER AFTER OUR DISCUSSION IF WE HAVE SOME CONTACTS IN SOME COMPANIES
SO WHICH CAN REPORT ON WHAT IS GOING ON THERE SO I WOULD BE GLAD IF YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THEM
SO YOU KNOW
UH OKAY FINDINGS THAT'S THE POINT THAT I'M WORKING ON CURRENTLY BUT UH SO FAR I I WAS UH LOOKING WHAT WHAT ARE THE BLUE CIRCUIT
I MEAN RADIO WAVE RADIO FREQUENCY CIRCUITS ARE AVAILABLE NOW BUT THE PRICES I READ ARE HIGH
SO
I KNOW THAT UH THE USER INTERFACE PEOPLE AND THESE SPEAK ABOUT RADIO FREQUENCY WAVES BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN UH YOU CAN MAKE THE T. V. DO WHAT YOU WANT EVEN IF YOU ARE IN THE BATHROOM OR SO ON
BUT YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU ARE NOT CLOSE TO THE T. V. YOU PROBABLY WON'T NEED TO TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM AND SO ON AND SO I AM I AM VOTING FOR S TO STICK TO THE UM INFRA RED CONTROL INSTEAD OF R. W. BUT WE WILL DISCUSS IT LATER MAYBE
UH
COMPONENTS TO USE I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT I WILL USE FOR THE DESIGN OF THE CIRCUIT
IT DEPENDS UH ON WHETHER WE WILL USE THE L. C. D. AND MAINLY THE SPEECH RECOGNITION BECAUSE THE SPEECH REC YEAH
NO NO NO NO NO
THIS WE THIS WE BUY I THINK BECAUSE IT'S RATHER CHEAP NOWADAYS AND IT'S NOT WORTH TO CONSTRUCT OURSELVES
EXACTLY
BUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE CIRCUIT WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
THIS I PREFER THAT WE SHOULD MAKE OURSELVES
BUT IT DEPENDS WHETHER WE TAKE A DECISION TO USE IT
SAME THING
IT'S FAIRLY EXPENSIVE TO USE THESE CIRCUITS
SO SPEECH RECOGNITION WELL L. C. D. IT'S OKAY BECAUSE IT'S COMMON NOWADAYS TO USE L. C. D. SO I AGREE ON USING ANY KIND OF L. C. D.
LESS BUTTONS GOOD FOR ME AS A AS A DESIGNER OF THE CIRCUIT
BUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WE HAVE TO COMPARE WHETHER THE PRICE AND THE WHAT DOES IT OFFER YOU KNOW
YEAH I'M
OH
I WAS NOT THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE PRICE
BUT IF WE USE THE L. C. D. UH EVEN THE RADIO FREQUENCY COMMUNICATION WITH THE T. V. SET AND THE BACKLIGHT AND UH RELATED THINGS LIKE THE PHOTO DIODES AND STUFF
IT SHOULD BE OKAY
IF WE DECIDE TO USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN WE PROBABLY COULD STRUGGLE BUT WE'LL SEE AFTERWARDS
IT DEPENDS OF YOU IF IF THE M. E. OR U. I. D.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE NAMES I DON'T REALLY KNOW UH WANT TO HAVE IT LIKE IN METAL OR IN PLASTIC
THESE THINGS
IT IT DEPENDS ON YOU NOT BECAUSE THE THE THE ELECTRONIC DEVICE'S PRICE IS NOT NOT SO BIG IN COMPARISON TO TO THE OVERALL SHAPE AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO
WE WILL DISCUSS IT AFTERWARDS
OH THIS IS NOTHING
THIS IS JUST MY NOTES ON WHAT TO USE
AND UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS YES I WOULD LIKE ALSO PREFERABLY TO USE R. W. CIRCUIT
BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW UH OF THE DESIGN AND PRICE I WOULD STICK TO I. R. S
THAT'S MY OPINION
UH I MEAN IF INFRA RED UH CIRCUIT NOT NOT THE RADIO FREQUENCY
BECAUSE BECAUSE THE THE RANGE WHERE YOU CAN USE IT IS FAIR
IT'S OKAY I THINK
AND THE PRICE IS FAIRLY CHEAP FOR THIS
WELL DEPENDS
JUS JUST THE PRICE
OTHERWISE I DON'T CARE WHAT I PUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S THE CHIP WHICH I BUY OR WHICH WE BUY
SO I I I THINK IT'S O Y O
WELL THREE TO THREE TO FIVE
N NOT TEN TIMES BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT WHAT WE
YEAH
TH THEY ARE USED TO USE IT WHEN THEY CAN SEE THE T. V. SO I DON'T KNOW
YOU THE USER INTERFACE AND MANAGEMENT MAN UH
UH OKAY THAT'S IT FOR ME
'KAY
I AGREE
OKAY SO THE AVAILABLE THINGS ARE L. C. D. THE BUTTONS AND EVERYTHING
UH RADIO FREQUENCY DEPENDS
AND WELL THE RECOGNITION IT DEPENDS ON YOU GUYS
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY SPEAK
OKAY
UH JUST ONE NOTE TO THE CHAN CHANNEL CHANGING
DO WE WILL WE USE ONLY TWO BUTTONS OR OR LIKE NUMBERED BUTTONS
I MEAN THOSE NINE PLUS ONE OR TWO
BECAUSE IT'S MANY BUTTONS AND WE WERE SPEAKING ABOUT LOWERING THE NUMBER
OKAY SO SO WE KEEP ALL THESE ALL THESE BUTTONS
LIKE TEN PLUS FIVE PLUS ONE PLUS ONE MINUS OR SOMETHING
OR USING THE NAMES AND THE KEYBOARD I DUNNO
YOU MEAN LIKE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE
OKAY SO S OH SORRY
SO IT REQUIRES THE USE OF L. C. D. PROBABLY TO TO TELL YOU
OKAY SO I'LL MAKE A NOTE ON L. C. D.
YEAH
LIKE ROLLER FOR THE YEAH
OKAY
SO WE ARE STILL S SPEAKING ABOUT THE COMMON DEVICES OR WE ARE INVITING THE NEW ONE
ON THE SCREEN YOU MEAN
NOT ON THE CONTROL BUT ON THE SCREEN
WELL THIS WOULD AVOID L. C. D. THEN
OH
W I I THINK IT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TO STICK TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AND NOT TO BOTHER THE T. V. TO TO TO PRINT THESE THINGS
WELL IT WI IT WILL BE STILL MORE EXPENSIVE BUT FOR THE L. C. D. AND THIS STUFF IS NO PROBLEM IN THE PRICE
TWO T. V. S
LIKE MA
WE WE COULD HAVE FOR EXAMPLE TWO BUTTONS LIKE SIMPLE MODE AND ADVANCED MODE
OR I DUNNO
OR LIKE CHILDREN AND GRANDFATHER'S MODE AND THE WELL THE THE USER
NOT THE USER THE MAN MANA T. V. MANAGER MODE
AH I DUNNO
UH
YEAH
HIDE THEM OKAY
UM
YES
THIS I WAS THINKING
DO WE NEED A POWER BUTTON AT ALL
SHOULD SHOULD SHOULDN'T WE DO IT LIKE SLEEP MODE AFTER FIVE MINUTES OF NOT USING IT
BECAUSE GENERALLY
YES
WELL I I UH
YOU DON'T NEED TO EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO KEEP IT ALIVE
UH PROBABLY
OKAY SO WE SHOULD KEEP THIS BUTTON
OKAY SO WE WE COULD P WHAT WE COULD PROBABLY DO IS TO KEEP ALSO TO KEEP UH KEEP THE L. C. D. AND ALL THE BUTTONS AND STUFF
WE COULD MAKE IT LIKE A OPENING OPENING STYLE THAT IF YOU OPEN IT YOU ARE YOU JUST TURN ON THE T. V. AND IF YOU CLOSE IT IT WILL
TURN OFF THE T. V.
IF IF YOU LIKE THIS
BECAUSE WELL IT'S MAYBE QUESTION FOR YOU T
YEAH
I MEAN LIKE THE
YEAH BUT SINCE WE HAVE THE L. C. D. WE DIDN'T NEED TOO MUCH BUTTON TOO MANY BUTTONS
UM OKAY JUST UM THE DECISION OF THE POWER BUTTON
SHOULD WE MAKE IT A BUTTON OR SOME SOME SOMETHING WHICH WOULD BE
UH POWER BUTTON
IF IT IF IT'S A BUTTON OR OKAY
OKAY ONE NICE BIG BUTTON
OLD FASHIONED BUTTON TO SATISFY THE GRANDMOTHERS
HMM
MM
DO WE STILL HAVE THE TIME
I I JUST WONDER
OKAY
OH
WELL WHAT W WHAT WAS THE QUESTION
YEAH BUT SINCE WE WANT TO CONTROL ALL THE TELEVISIONS
AND AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE WORTH TO TO SET THE TIMING ON THE REMOTE NO
BECAUSE IF IF THE T. V. TURNS ON ITSELF IT WELL YOU KNOW IF THE TIME THE TIMER SHOULD BE THERE
AH YEAH
DID YOU DID YOU EVER USE THE LIKE THE TIMING OF TURNING ON THE T. V. WELL AND BASED ON YOUR
YEAH BUT IT CAN BE ON THE DISPLAY IN IN A CORNER ALL THE TIME ON THE REMOTE
YES YES
YEAH BUT WE WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE BATTERY LIFE THEN
IF WE USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH
OKAY
B YOU THINK UH I I'M USER INTERFACE MANAGER
OKAY
OKAY
IF I COULD GO THERE WITH THIS CABLE
SH OKAY
WHERE'S DELETE BUTTON
OKAY
OH I'M SORRY
OKAY
OH
PRESENTATION THREE
OH
OKAY SO HERE IS MY PRESENTATION ABOUT TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN
I WILL TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND S OF SYSTEM AND HOW THEY REACT TOGETHER
OKAY UH FIRST WHAT IS A REMOTE CONTROL
SIMPLY IT'S A DEVICE AS YOU KNOW FOR UH
FOR SENDING SOME COMMANDS BY SOME WAVES TO UH ANOTHER DEVICE TO TO TELL DIFFERENT COMMANDS UH WITH THIS DEVICE
AND THE MAIN IDEA WE DON'T USE ANY CABLE AND WE CAN REC REACT SIMPLER WITH THE DEVICE
UH I IT HAS DIFFERENT BLOCKS DIFFERENT BLOCKS
UH FIRST IS REMOTE CONTROL HAVE SH HA SHOULD HAVE SOME ELECTRIC CIRCUITS UH MAKING INTERFACE WITH UH KEYBOARD AND UH R READING UH KEYBOARD AND READING THE KEYBOARD UH COMMANDS
AND THEN INTER THEN MAKE UH THESE KEYBOARD COMMANDS UH IN INTERPRET THESE INT UH KEYBOARD COMMANDS
AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE UH AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT MAKING UH ELECTRONIC SIGNALS ACCORDING TO THESE COMMANDS AND UH FINALLY THERE IS A TRANSMITTER WHICH IS A CORD OR A A DIODE MAKING UH MAKING UH WAVES TO TRANSMIT THROUGH THE AIR AND UH UH THIS AIR THIS UH WAVE UH WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE BY THE OTHER DEVICE LIKE A TELEVISION OR WHATEVER
TO UH R TO REALISE THE COMMAND
OKAY UH ABOUT WHAT I FOUND ABOUT UH DIFFERENT UH THESE DIFFERENT BLOCKS ARE UH USUALLY THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT METHODS UH TO FOR DESIGNING A REMOTE CONTROL
THEY ARE BASED ON INFRA RED UH WAVES OR UH UH RADIO WAVES
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT UH UH SOLUTIONS I MEAN
THIS IS UH THIS CAN BE UH UH THE THE DIFFERENCES THE TH BETWEEN DIFFERENT KIND OF WAVES INFRA RED OR RADIO WAVES
AND UH ALSO AS UH I UNDERSTOOD AND UH I THINK IT WAS A PART OF UH BOB
UH UH PRESENTATION PEOPLE PREFER TO HAVE UH TO HAVE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH LESS BUTTON
SO FOR THE ELECTRONIC PART WORKING AND INTERFACING WITH BUTTON
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD TRY TO T TRY TO DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROL HAVING UH SOME SOME SIMPLER BUTTONS OR SOME ROLLING BUTTONS TO JUST TO JUST TO SEARCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT OPTIONS
AND SHOWING O SOMETHING ON T. V. AND PUTTING LESS LESSER STUFF ON THE UH ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES
UH UH UH UH CERTAINLY A REMOTE CONTROL WITH UH WORKING WITH RADIO WAVES IS UH PREFERRED BECAUSE UH YOU CAN PR YOU CAN TAKE IT IN ANY DIRECTION AND YOU DON'T NEED TO TUNE IT ANY WAY
AND UH UH AGAIN USING BIGGER BUTTONS AND LESS NUMBER OF BUTTONS ARE ALSO PREFERRED AS I SEE
OKAY
THAT WAS MY PRESENTATION
UH-HUH
UH I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE UH WE CAN MAKE UH WE CA WE CAN MAKE THIS WAVE IN A SPECIFIC FREQUENCY
SO THEY CAN BE IN A RANGE WHICH IS NOT INTER INTERFERING WITH THE WITH OTHER DEVICES INSIDE THE HOME
UH NO BUT AS I KNOW THERE IS A RANGE FOR UH FOR THIS UH F FOR FOR UH FOR THIS STUFF FOR DESIGNING THIS CIRCUIT
WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN TUNE OUR UH TRANSMITTER TO WORK IN THIS RANGE AND FOR THIS RANGE WE DON'T NEED TO ASK ANY PERMISSION
UH FOR THIS I'M NOT UH I I DON'T KNOW THE SOLUTION BUT ONE SOLUTION CAN BE SOMETHING LIKE PUTTING UH P PASSWORD OR SOMETHING INSIDE THE WAVE
SO THE ONLY YOUR T. V. CAN UNDERSTAND IT YEAH IDENTIFICATION CODE INSIDE THE
THE PASSWORD MAY SIMPLY UH OR UH I IDENTIFICATION CODE MAY SIMPLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
A SPECIFIC UH REMOTE CONTROL HAS A SPECIFIC F
MM
MM-HMM
FIVE
MM-HMM
MM
MM
MM
YES
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH AT LEAST NINE TEN BUTTON
OR
OR SOMETHING
MM-HMM
OKAY
LIKE CATEGORISING CHANNELS
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO UH WE DON'T HAVE ANY UH WE DON'T HAVE UH WE SHOULD JUST DESIGN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WE SH WE DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO THE TO THE T. V. DESIGN OR WE CAN CHANGE SOME DESIGN
BECAUSE ONE SOLUTION FOR THIS UM UH UH CH CHANGING CHANNELS IS TO SEE A SUMMARY OF ALL CHANNELS
SOME SOME PREVIEW OF ALL CHANNELS AND THEN YOU CAN YEAH
YEAH B NOT ON THE CONTROL ON THE SCREEN ON THE T. V. SCREEN
AND THEN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
SETTINGS
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH THEY CAN YEAH THEY CAN BE HIDE SOMEWHERE BY A COVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
LIKE COVERING CU
YEAH LIKE MOBILE PHONE COVERING
A BUTTON IS BETTER
YEAH
MM
CLOCK OR
YES
MM
MM
YES
MM
AND UH DO WE NEED TO INCLUDE ANYTHING ABOUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND THE SPEECH COMMANDS OR
I I THIN I THINK IT WILL NOT TAKE LOTS OF PLACE WE JUST NEED A MICROPHONE AND THE SOFTWARE
SO AND IT SH AND IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT NEW AND INTERESTING
SO PEOPLE MAY BE ATTRACTED TO BUY THIS STUFF AND IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO UH PUT A SOFTWARE INSIDE THE THE ELECTRONIC DEVICE AND PUT A MICROPHONE
IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT MUCH PLACE AND ALSO THAT MUCH IT DOESN'T COST THAT MUCH
MM-HMM
THANKS
OKAY CAN I HAVE THE LAPTOP OVER HERE OR
OKAY
HAVE TO GET UP
EXCUSE ME
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO BASICALLY I'M GONNA PRESENT SOME FINDINGS OF A STUDY WE CONDUCTED UH INTO UH WHAT USERS WANT IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL
UM SO FIRST OF ALL WE WHAT WE DID IS WE UM CONDUCTED A AN EXPERIMENT WITH A HUNDRED TEST SUBJECTS
UM WE PUT THEM IN A IN OUR UM USABILITY LABORATORY AND GOT THEM TO YOU KNOW UM PLAY WITH REMOTE CONTROLS AND ALSO TO COMPLETE
AFTER THEY'D DONE THAT TO COMPLETE A QUESTIONNAIRE UH TO TELL US WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE IN REMOTE CONTROLS
SO BASICALLY UM THE MAJOR THINGS WE FOUND OUT WAS THAT UM BASICALLY USERS DON'T LIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF OF MOST REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET
UM THEY YOU KNOW SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WE WE UH DID THE EXPERIMENTS ON
FOUND THAT REM REMOTE THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT THEY'D USED IN THE PAST WERE UGLY
COMPLETELY UGLY
UM THEY THEY DIDN'T MATCH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER THAT IS YOU KNOW THE THE WAY USERS USE REMOTE CONTROLS WHEN THEY'RE WATCHING T. V.
UM THAT THE LAYOUT OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS DIDN'T MATCH THEY WAY THAT THEY USED IT
UM AND
THIRDLY THEY SAY THAT W HALF OF THE USERS THAT WE UM TESTED SAID THAT THEY ONLY USED TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS THAT UH ARE ON REMOTE CONTROLS
UM SO WE COLLECT WE ALSO SOME COLLECTED SOME USAGE STATISTICS UH BASED ON HOW THESE TEST SUBJECTS WERE USING THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
AND FROM THIS WE BASICALLY CAME UP WITH THE FIGURE THAT
THE CHANNEL BUTTONS THE CHANNEL SELECTION BUTTONS ARE THE MOST BY FAR THE MOST USED BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM AND YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE USED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES PER HOUR ON AVERAGE UM WHILE THE USER'S WATCHING T. V.
UM THE CLOSEST BUTTON THAT WAS USED WELL THE CL THE BUTTON THAT WAS USED THAT WAS CLOSEST TO THE CHANNEL BUTTON WAS THE TELETEXT BUTTON
UM WHICH WAS USED FOURTEEN TIMES PER HOUR FOLLOWED BY THE VOLUME BUTTON WHICH WAS FOUR TIMES PER HOUR UM
ALL THE OTHER ALL THE OTHER UM BUTTONS SUCH AS CH UM AUDIO AND PICTURE SELECTION UM CONFIGURATION BUTTONS AND THINGS WERE USED
YOU KNOW L APPROX WELL LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ONE TIMES PER HOUR
UM WE ALSO ASKED USERS UM WHICH BUTTONS HAD THE MOST IMPORTANCE TO THEM
YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH BUTTONS THEY FELT WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND BASICALLY THEY CAME THEY SAID THE CHANNEL VOLUME AND POWER BUTTONS HAD THE HIGHEST RELEVANCE TO USERS UM NOTE THAT ONLY POWER WAS VERY INFREQUENTLY USED
IT ONLY HAD A B A A FR USAGE FREQUENCY OF ABOUT ONE TIMES PER HOUR BUT USERS RANKED IT AS HAVING A VERY VERY HIGH RELEVANCE
UM AND THE AUDIO AND PICTURE SETTINGS HAD A VERY THAT WELL THE USERS THOUGHT THAT UM W THE AUDIO AND PICTURE SETTINGS WERE VERY UH WEREN'T VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM UM
AND THEY USED THEM VERY INFREQUENTLY A AS WELL
SO WE ASKED USERS WHAT WHAT UM FRUSTRATES THEM THE MOST ABOUT UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
AND
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS SAID THAT UH WHAT FRUSTRATES THEM IS LOSING THE REMOTE CONTROL UM SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND IT
UM THEY ALSO SAID THAT IT UM IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO LEARN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S MANY BUTTONS AND IT'S A YOU KNOW A C A A UNINTUITIVE INTERFACE
UM AND THEN THIRDLY
THEY SOME USERS COMMENTED ON THE FACT THAT THE THE YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE TO HOLD AND PRESS BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL AR ARE BAD AND UM CAUSE U REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
WE ALSO ASKED SOME USERS ABOUT SOME SPECIFIC FEATURES THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE IN THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
IN PARTICULAR DO THEY WANT AN L. C. D. D DISPLAY AND SECONDLY DO THEY THINK SPEECH RECOGNITION UH IS A USEFUL FEATURE TO HAVE ON A REMOTE CONTROL
UM BASICALLY OUR FINDINGS ARE THAT UM AMONGST A YOUNGER AGE GROUPS UH THE ANSWER IS UMV OVERWHELMINGLY YES
THEY WANT THESE FEATURES THEY WANT THESE HIGH TECHNOLOGY FEATURES
UM FOR INSTANCE NINETY ONE PERCENT OF PE OF PEOPLE AGED BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE SAID YES THEY WANT THESE FEATURES
WHEREAS UM THE THE TREND WAS AS USERS AS USERS UM BECAME OLDER AND OLDER UH THEY WERE LESS LIKELY TO WANT THESE SORT OF FEATURES IN A UM IN A REMOTE CONTROL
SO I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING OUR OUR MARKET
UM AND AS OUR COMPANY MOTTO IS PUTTING FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
UM I THINK WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE YOUNGER YOUNGER UM TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC
AND SO MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT ADDING THESE SORT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY FEATURES INTO OUR REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S MY DIC THAT'S MY PRESENTATION
THANK YOU
YEAH IT'S TRUE BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE FEATURES THAT USERS WANT
SO IT'S AND OUR PRODUCTION COST OF TWELVE FIFTY EUROS PER PER UNIT IS FAIRLY HIGH I THINK
SO I THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO TO ADD THESE SORT OF FEATURES INTO OUR REMOTE
IT IS TRUE
THAT'S THE WRONG ONE I THINK
OKAY
I HAVE A QUESTION
DO YOU THINK RADIO WAVES UM WILL INTERFERE WITH OTHER APPLIANCES IN THE HOME
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
ARE WE UM ARE WE PLANNING TO TAKE AN OFF THE SHELF AN O. E. M. COMPONENT FOR THE RADIO WAVE CIRCUIT
OR ARE WE PLANNING TO CONSTRUCT OUR OWN CIRCUIT BOARD
OKAY S
SO WE JUST BUY A CIRCUIT BOARD AND OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
WHAT HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE
ARE WE TALKING THREE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE
OR TEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE
OR
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S STILL A LOT
I THINK IT'S IT'S PROBABLY NOT WORTH SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY
BECAUSE I MEAN ALL THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS ON THE MARKET HAVE INFRA RED SO PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING OTHER THAN INFRA RED
SO IT'S NOT WORTH SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY
YEAH
YEAH
BUT I THINK BASED ON MY USABILITY STUDIES I TH I FEEL THAT USERS ARE PRIORITISE THE LOOK AND THE FEEL AND THE TRENDINESS ABOVE
YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INFRA RED OR RADIO WAVES
SO I THINK WE'RE BETTER OFF SPENDING MONEY IN THE USABILITY PHASE
OKAY
MM
WELL SHOULD WE START WITH JUST THE CORE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS THAT WE NEED
AND THEN WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE MORE ADVANCED FEATURES
OKAY WELL I MEAN THE OBVIOUS ONE IS CHANGING CHANNELS
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH I
AH YEAH
TO HAVE SOME FEEDBACK
YEAH
WE COULD MAYBE ALSO C UM INCORPORATE PETRE'S IDEA OF THE UM SLIDER FOR THE VOLUME WITH THE CHANNEL
SO WE C YOU COULD QUICKLY JUST THROUGH MANY CHANNELS
FOR THE CHANNELS PERHAPS
SO WE'VE GOT CHANNEL AND VOLUME
UM
I THINK SO
I THINK BASICALLY THE CORE FUNCTIONS WE WANT AND THEN MORE ADVANCED ONES
YEAH
I DON'T
OH I DON'T BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE WE'RE THE ONES
I MEAN THIS REMOTE CONTROL WE'RE DEVELOPING IS A GENERIC CONTROL FOR ALL T. V. S I THINK
OKAY
BUT THEN YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY TOO COMPLICATED AT THE SAME TIME
I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS WE CAN ALWAYS HAVE THESE L LESS OFTEN USED FUNCTIONS HIDDEN SOMEWHERE UNDER A COVER OR AT THE BACK OF UNDER A SLIDE OR SOME
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT
UM
SO I THINK S THE SETTINGS WE TH WE ARE AGREEING ARE AGREED THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED
IT'S JUST HOW TO A
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
UH OKAY WHAT ELSE
I MEAN A POWER BUTTON'S OBVIOUSLY
UH REQUIRED
UH WELL I THINK WHEN THEY SAY POWER BUTTON THEY MEAN TO TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF
BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. FOR TWO HOURS YOU DON'T WANT YOUR T. V. TO TURN OFF AFTER FIVE FIVE MINUTE
I MEAN BASED ON OUR USABILITY STUDIES AGAIN UM PE UM PEOPLE SAID THAT THE POWER BUTTON WAS V A VERY RELEVANT BUTTON
UM YOU KNOW IT WAS NINE OUT OF TEN
RE RELEVANCE
OKAY
B OKAY
I THINK WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE YOU KNOW THE MAJOR USAGE OF THE TH OF THE CONTROL WHICH IS YOU SIT DOWN
YOU TURN ON YOUR T. V. YOU CHANGE CHANNELS YOU CHANGE THE VOLUME YOU TURN THE T. V. OFF
UM AND ALL THE OTHER F FUNCTIONALITY IS
NOT USED VERY OFTEN
YEAH
I THINK A BUTTON
I THINK IT SHOULD BE A BU
ITS OWN BUTTON ON THE FRONT
OKAY
S
WHAT ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE CLOCK AND UM TIMERS
UH UM YOU KNOW SOME FUNC SOME FEATURES ON THE CONTROL TO DISPLAY A TIME OR T TO DISPLAY
PROBABLY NOT
IT'S A QUESTI YEAH IT'S A TRADE OFF
'KAY
OKAY SIMPLE
VERY YEAH OKAY VERY OCCASIONALLY
BUT I DO USE THE I DO USE THE DISPLAY OF THE TIME QUITE OFTEN BUT
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S OKAY THAT'S TRUE
OKAY SO NO TIME BUTTON
OKAY
OKAY COOL
OKAY
THANK YOU
HELLO UH THIS MEETING WE ARE IT'S FO SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UM THE GOAL OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH A DECISION AT THE END ON THE CONCEPT AND I THINK THE LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT AN A LOT AND WE HAD A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING TO BE
BUT UH IN TH AT THE END OF THIS MEETING WE HAVE TO TO REACH A DECISION
SO UH
WE WILL HAVE AGAIN THREE PRESENTATION FROM ALL OF YOU AND UH I HOPE IT WILL BE FAST BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE TIME TO
FOR LONG DISCUSSION AND
AND DECISIONS
SO WHO WANTS TO START
OKAY
SO START UH
UH
THIS ONE
TURN
HMM
OKAY
LIKE A SPONGE
YEAH
YEAH UH YEAH
EASY TO USE IS IT UH
A AS MUCH AS IMPORTANT THAN TECHNOLOGY OR FANCY THING
IT'S LESS IMPORTANT RIGHT
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
SO HAMED CAN YOU
MM-HMM
UM
NUMBER
THREE
THIS ONE
SO IT'S NOT THIS ONE
OKAY
YEAH
THIS ONE YEAH
OH
OOPS
CAN YOU FIT ANY UH FOR EXAMPLE A T. F. T. OR ANY ELECTRONIC DEVICE IN A SPONGY THING OR IS THERE ANY PROBLEM FOR THAT
FOR EXAMPLE PUT ELECTRONIC CARD ON A SPONGY THING I CAN I CAN IMAGINE IT COULD BE A PROBLEM
YEP
OKAY
SO
OKAY
MAYBE PUT ELECTRONIC IN A BOX AND A SPONGY THING AROUND
MAYBE AFTER
YEAH
NO I DON'T THINK IT'S SEVEN BY SEVEN I THINK IT'S SEVEN THE DIAGONAL IS SEVEN
USUALLY WHEN THEY SAY SEVEN INCH I THINK IT'S THE DIAGONAL
YEAH
I DUNNO I DUN I DUN ONE EACH
BUT YEAH
LET'S GO
SO LET'S CUT THE T. F. T.
MM
THESE TECHNICAL ENGINEERS HUH
WHAT USER WANTS
HE WANTS A SMALL REMOTE CONTROL OR
UH UH WITH BIG BUTTONS
IT'S DIFFICULT
A SM
SO MAYBE YOU CAN FINISH YOUR PRESENTATION AND AFTERWARDS WE WILL DISCUSS ABOUT ALL THIS
THAT'S IT
OKAY
SO
NO
UH SO I THINK WE HAVE A LOT WE HAVE TO TAKE DECISION TODAY
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOME WORK TO FINALISE OUR IDEA AND TAKE DECISIONS
UH FIRST I THINK ENERGY IT'S A KEY PROBLEM BECAUSE UH IT DEPEND WHAT CAN WE HAVE AS FEATURE IF WE USE ONLY BATTERIES
FOR EXAMPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BECAUSE CAN WE HAVE L. C. D. AND SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH BATTERY AND IT'S ALSO R RELATED TO THE SIZE OF THE OF THE DEVI OF THE DEVICE
OKAY
SO OKAY
UH LIKE BUT USING HOW MANY BATTERIES FOR EXAMPLE
ARE ARE WHAT MAYBE WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE BATTERY
OKAY
UH ONE TWO
OKAY
THE TELEVISION LIGHTS
AT LEAST WHEN THERE IS T. V. YOU CAN GET LIGHT FROM THE T. V.
I DUNNO
OKAY
MM
AT LEAST IT'S NEW AND MAYBE TECHNOLOGY NEW TECHNOLOGY
YEAH
UM
SO I THINK BEFORE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER THING IT'S IMPORTANT THING IT'S THE CASE
UH WHAT WHAT ARE GONNA BE THE SIZE BECAUSE ITS WEIGHT DRIVES THE OTHER WHAT WE ARE GOING TO USE AS FEATURES AND SO ON
FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE FOR THE L. C. D. IF WE CHOOSE TO HAVE A SMALL DEVICE WE CANNOT USE THIS UM A SUCH A A A SCREEN
OH
I'VE I S I THINK THE EASIEST THING WOULD BE TO TO HAVE A SMALLER L. C. D. IF IT'S POSSIBLE
OKAY
SO WE ARE AGREE WITH A SMALL
L. C. D.
YEAH
TACTILE OR SOMETHING YEAH
TOUCH SCREEN YEAH
YEAH
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A LIMIT IN A MONTH OF TIME SO WE CANNOT DO SOMETHING VERY NEW
SO LET'S GO FOR A SMALL L. C. D.
YEAH OKAY
SO FIVE BY S TEN
UM SO WHAT ABOUT SO THE CASE WE TALKED ABOUT
UM SOMETHING EASY TO USE YOU SAID SOMETHING EASY TO USE BUT HOW DOES THAT FIT IN A FASHION WAY LIKE WITH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
AND ABOUT THE COLOUR AND LOGO OF THE OF THE COMPANY AND SO ON NOW CAN WE DO THAT
MY FIRST IDEA IS BECAUSE
OUR COLOUR IS MORE YELLOW AND THE IT SHOULD BE EASY TO TAKE IN A HAND
I THOUGHT ABOUT BANANA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH IS FRUITS AND
A BIG BANANA
UM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT'S JUST AN IDEA
I DUNNO WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT BUT
YEAH
I DUNNO IF IT CAN FIT WITH THE TECHNOLOGY
YOU ARE THE SPECIALISTS OF THAT
SO
YEAH AND
THE SCREEN HAS TO BE SQUARE
OR IT CAN BE LIKE A A SHAPE QUITE UH WITH CURVES
IT COULD
YEAH
OKAY OKAY
YEAH
YEAH IT SHOULD REMEMBER BANANA BUT IT'S NOT DOESN'T HAVE TO B TO BE UH UH REALLY THE SIZE AND EXACTLY THE SHAPE OF A BANANA
SO WE ARE AGREE WITH THE BANANA THING
OKAY
SO THE LAST POINT WE DECIDED IT'S INFRA RED I GUESS
EVERYBODY'S AGREED
UH SO THAT'S IT I THINK ABOUT THE CONCEPTS
YOU HAVE OTHER THING TO ADD TO THIS POINT OR UH NO
SO UH ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE SO WE ARE GOING TO USE L. C. D.
IN THE LAST MEETING WE TALKED ABOUT UH HIDDEN BUTTONS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WITH THAT
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BUTTONS ON THE SIDE
MM WHAT
YEAH
OKAY
AND YOU MEAN THE FIRST LAYER WOULD BE SPONGY
SO IS IT IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO THAT
IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TECHNICALLY
LIKE DOING A SPONGY LAYER OF THE BANANA AND YOU OPEN IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT DO YOU SEE THAT AS A
RIGID THING OR LIKE LIKE A BANANA SOMETHING VERY SOFT YOU CAN OPEN LIKE BANANA OR
YEAH
SO I DUNNO WHAT YOU THINK BOB BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR USERS I THINK AND VERY GOOD FOR MARKETING
YEAH
YEAH
UM
AND SETTING BUTTONS
HIDDEN IN
MM OTHER REMARKS OR SOMETHING OR
SOMETHING WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT YES YET OR
I THINK
WE ARE ALMOST THERE
UH MAYBE HOW CAN WE IF WE HAVE A SOFT THING
LIKE THIS AND TO OPEN IT WE HAVE TO ATTACH IT SOMEWHERE I DUNNO HOW TO DO THAT TECHNICALLY OR
AND HOW
YEAH MAYBE
MA MAGNETIC OH
OKAY
OKAY
AND WHAT WOULD BE THE MATTER HERE OF THE FIRST LAYER I MEAN
MM
LIKES
SOFT PLASTIC OR
YEAH YEAH YEAH
HMM
AND SOMETHING WE FORGOT MAYBE UH ABOUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM ARE WE GOING TO USE IT OR NOT
IT I YEAH IT SEEMS FEASIBLE AND IT WOULD BE SOMETHING VERY GREAT
SO WE HAVE THE DE DESIGN THE A GOOD SHAPE NEW AND SO ON AND WE HAVE ALSO THE TECHNOLOGY THING W WILL BE
AND EVEN THE EASY TO USE THING SO IT WILL BE PERFECT
SO WE ADD ALSO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION DEVICE
SO THAT GREAT
WE HAVE DECIDED EVERYTHING
AND THINK WE ARE ON A GOOD WAY
SO UM
UH THE NEXT MEETING WILL START IN THIRTY MINUTES
UM SO UH THE THE INDUSTRIAL MANAGER UH WILL UH WILL WORK ON THE LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
THE USER INTERFACE UH UH MANA UH MANAGER WILL WORK ON THE USER INTERFACE DEVICE
AND THE THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL DO THE FIRST PROJECT EVALUATION
SO I HOPE YOU CAN DO THAT IN THIRTY MINUTES
AND UH YEAH I
UH I THINK YOU SHOULD WORK TOGETHER S YOU UH HAMED AND PETER TO WORK UH IN A IN A FIRST PROTOTYPE AND UH
MORE ABOUT THE SHAPE AND SO ON AND HOW YOU CAN MANAGE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER
AND UM AS USUAL YOU WILL RECEIVE SOME SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ON
SO THANK YOU ALL EVERYBODY AND SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
MM-HMM
HMM
WHAT DOES IT MEAN SPONGY
LIKE SOFT OR SOMETHING
OKAY
I WILL SEE
OKAY
I THINK THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE WILL BE THE EASY TO USE FEATURE
WE'LL SEE
EXACTLY
UH OKAY SO GOOD NEWS FROM ME UH UH FOR ME FROM HAMED BUT BAD NEWS FROM BOB OBVIOUSLY
BECAUSE SPONGY DESIGN I DON'T LIKE IT AS OKAY SO COULD YOU PLEASE FABIEN OPEN IT
I'M PERSON TWO
AND WHICH ONE UH PROBABLY THE FIRST ONE
I'M NOT SURE BUT CHECK THE FIRST ONE
I MOST OF THE THINGS I HAVE TO WRITE MYSELF ON THE BOARD BUT YEAH THAT'S IT
JUST
IT'S ONLY THIS SLIDE
YEAH
THIS THIS IS JUST UH ONE THING I WANTED TO MENTION AND SHOW YOU THAT I JUST UH I JUST FOUND THIS
THAT OUR COMPANY UH DEVELOPED A S A SEVEN F SEVEN FINGERS OR I'LL JUST YEAH
SEVEN SEVEN INCH T. T. F. T. SCREEN WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR US SINCE WE WANTED TO INCLUDE A DISPLAY THERE
UH SO I I PROBABLY DRAW IT DOWN RAW SCHEME
THIS IS THIS IS THE STUFF THAT I CAN USE TO OKAY
SO THE THIS WILL BE LIKE THE OVERALL SCHEME OR OVERALL REQUIREMENTS FROM THE ENGINEERING POINT OF VIEW
UH FIRST THING IS UH THIS WILL BE THE OVERALL SHAPE
NO UH I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE REAL SHAPE OF THE DEVICE BUT THE SHAPE OF THE INSIDE OF THE DEVICE
SO THERE WILL BE SOME CIRCUIT UH FOR THE POWER
SO SAY POWER CIRCUIT HERE
UH THE MAIN ENERGY WILL BE TAKEN FROM BATTERIES THAT WE CAN UH UH AND IF WE DECIDE TO USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION STUFF THERE
WE MUST USE ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF ENERGY WHICH I FOUND THE BEST IS TO USE THE SOLAR CELLS WHICH CAN WHICH CAN UH SUPPLY EVERYTHING
I WAS COMPUTING ALL THE ALL THE THINGS RELATED TO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND IT'S OKAY TO USE JUST UH TWO BATTERIES AND SOLAR CELLS SO
SO NO PROBLEM
THERE CAN BE ALSO SOLAR CELL
UH THE MAIN BOARD WITH ALL THE CIRCUITS WILL TAKE AT LEAST SEVEN TO SEVEN CENTIMETRES SO THIS IS MY LIKE HARD REQUIREMENT FOR THE GUYS FROM THE DESIGN
SO AT LEAST SEVEN TO SEVEN
IT DEPENDS WHERE YOU PUT YOUR SCREEN BECAUSE THE SCREEN IS UH SEVEN INCH SO IT DEPENDS ON YOU WHERE WHERE YOU PUT IT
IT DOESN'T MATTER
UM IT'S JUST ONE CORD FROM FROM THE MAIN BOARD TO THE SCREEN WHICH CAN BE ELSEWHERE
SO THIS WILL BE T. F. T.
AND ON THE MAIN BOARD WE HAVE THE UM INTERFACE TO THE MICROPHONE WHICH IS SOMEWHERE
SAY HERE
INTERFACE TO THE MICROPHONE
THEN THE GRAPHICAL CARD UH FOR THE T. F. T. AND THE THIRD UNIT IS THE I. R.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE CAN UH WE DECIDED TO USE THE INFRA RED UNIT BECAUSE OUR COMPANY HAS ALSO DEVELOPED THE CHIP FOR COMMUNICATION BY THE INFRA RED
INCLUDING ALL THE STUFF INSIDE SO IT WILL BE VERY CHEAP FOR US
SO INFRA RED HERE
SO THE ONCE AGAIN THE OVERALL REQUIREMENTS SEVEN TO SEVEN CENTIMETRES FOR THE BOARD
WHICH HAS TO BE WHICH CAN BE SPONGY BUT HAS TO BE THIS SIZE AND THE T. F. T. WHICH IS SEVEN INCHES
UM I HAVE TO CHECK WHAT I WANTED TO
UH FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ABOUT THE MATERIAL USED FOR THE OVERALL DES UH OV ALL THE DEVICE
A ALL THESE THINGS IN IN UH IN THIS BOX ARE OKAY TO PUT IN IN ANY SHAPE BASICALLY
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE T. F. T.
WELL SPONGINESS
MAYBE IT A GOOD FEATURE SINCE IT TAKES IF IT'S AROUND THE T. F. T. THEN IT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S JUST KEEPS IT SAFE I DUNNO
WELL IT'S MAYBE RELATED TO THE U. I.
A YEAH THAT'S ALL FROM ME
YEAH
WELL SEVEN TO SEVEN INCHES
YES
YEAH BUT
TO BE HONEST I WAS
YEAH HONESTLY SPEAKING I WAS THINKING THAT IT WAS SEVEN CENTIMETRES INITIALLY BUT IT'S SEVEN INCHES
BUT I I THINK WE CAN WE CAN CUT IT
YEAH NO NO PROBLEM BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE THEN THE SIZE OF THE GRAPHIC CARD WILL BE ONE FOURTH
SO
YEAH BUT NO PROBLEM TO TO ME TO CUT THE SCREEN
SO SO FOR THE SAME PRICE WE HAVE FOUR SCREENS NOW
AH WELL THIS IS LIKE THIS IS ALMOST NOTHING
SEVEN TO SEVEN TO AT LEAST WELL SOME THREE MILLIMETRES OR SOMETHING
YEAH BUT WE WANTED THE BIG BUTTONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT YOU KNOW
BECAUSE IF IT'S T TOO SMALL WE CAN WE CAN LOSE IT AT HOME YOU KNOW
I THOUGHT THAT IT IT SHOULD FIT IN THE HAND OR SOMETHING
W I I THINK SO
I IF THE ROLLER BUTTONS ARE ON THE SIDE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CATCH IT LIKE THAT BUT JUST LIKE THIS AND YOU KNOW FOLLOW FOLLOW WELL
THAT'S THAT'S NO TASK FOR ME BUT WELL SEVEN TO SEVEN AT LEAST YEAH BUT
OH OKAY
OKAY THANKS
NOT
J UH JUST A POINT TO THE ENERGY TH THINGS
IF WE USE THE BATTERIES AND THE ADDITIONAL SO SOLAR CELL
THEN IT'S OKAY FOR L. UH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND L. C. D. SO NO PROBLEM IN ENERGY I THINK
BUT WE HAVE TO USE THE SOLAR CELL
OTHERWISE NOT
YEAH I WAS THINKING JUST COMMON A. A. CELLS
SO LIKE THREE TO FIVE CENTIMETRES I DUNNO EXACTLY BUT
S
UH D DOESN'T NEED TO BE SUN
IT IT'S JUST THE DAYLIGHT YOU KNOW
YEAH WELL I I SUPPOSE THAT I SUPPOSE THAT UH THAT THIS REMOTE CONTROL WON'T BE IN THE IN THE ROOM LIKE THIS
WHERE THERE IS LIGHT ONLY WHEN WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE BUT
YEAH FROM THE T. I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH UH
AH IT'S A IT'S A COMPROMISE NO
YEAH THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO TO INCLUDE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION BECAUSE YOU WANTED ALL THE NEW THINGS
UH THE S THE SCREEN IS OKAY BUT THE BOARD UH THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WELL WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU GUESS AS A SHAPE
OR WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE SHAPE
MM
OKAY
OKAY
FIVE TO TEN
WELL THAT
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH I THINK IT'S FEASIB WELL ONE UM UM HOW COULD WE DO IT
WE COULD PUT THE BOARD NEXT TO WELL
UNDER THE L. C. D. AND FOR EXAMPLE MAKE THE L. C. D. BE TOTALLY UNRELATED TO THE THING THAT YOU HOLD IN YOUR HAND
LIKE HOLDING SOMETHING AND THE L. C. D. TO BE JUST ON TOP OF IT YOU KNOW SOMEHOW
WELL BUT MAYBE LET'S STICK TO THE S SPONGY THING LIKE ONE UNIT
WELL FI FIVE TO TEN IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE
OKAY SO FIVE TO TEN I I THINK IT'S IT'S FEASIBLE
I'LL MAKE IT
FO FIVE BY TEN
MM-HMM
OKAY SO
YEAH SO SO JUST JUST GIVE ME THE THE THE FIVE BY TEN NUMBERS THAT YOU FIND THE BEST AND SEND IT ME AND I WILL WORK IT OUT
HMM
SEVEN TO TEN BANANA
OKAY
RATHER MANGO OR SOMETHING OR
YOU MEAN BANANA
WELL BUT
IF IT'S IF IT IF THE BANANA IS BIG ENOUGH
THEN YES
BUT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN NO
WELL
WELL IT CAN BE WHATEVER YOU WANT
BUT IF IT'S SQUARE THEN WE GET FOUR SCREENS OUT OF ONE BY CUTTING JUST
BUT IF YOU WANT SOME SHAPE THEN WE CAN ONLY GET LIKE TWO SCREENS OUT OF SEVEN TO SEVEN INCHES SO
IT'S LIKE MORE MORE EXPENSIVE TO HAVE SHAPE LIKE THAT
BUT I DON'T CARE
YOU KNOW IF WE FIT THIS REQUIREMENT
OKAY
YEAH M MAYBE THE BANANA COULD BE LIKE A BIT UH FATTER THAN THAN THE C C COMMON ONE
BUT
LIKE MODIFIED BANANA OKAY
WELL IT WE'LL STICK TO BANANA OR
OKAY
MM MM
YEAH YEAH
SURE
LIKE LIKE PEELING OF THE BANANA YOU S
IT WOULD BE COOL YEAH
PEELING OF THE BANANA YOU KNOW SHOULD SHOULD DISCOVER THE OTHER BUTTONS WHICH ARE HIDDEN
FIRST LAYER OBVIOUSLY SPO YEAH W IT'S IT'S LIKE SILLY BUT THE PEOPLE WILL REALLY APPRECIATE IT YEAH I THINK
WELL IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT SOFT
SO I THINK IF IT'S SO THEN IT'S COOL
COOL
HONESTLY SPEAKING I CANNOT IMAGINE IT SO FAR BUT IT WILL BE TERRIBLE
MM
POF
WELL SINCE SINCE THE SINCE THE THINGS LIKE THE LIKE THE SCREEN AND UM HOW TO SAY THAT SOLAR CELL HAS TO BE HAS TO BE LIKE KEPT
KEPT IN THE SHAPE WE CANNOT B UH SO WE NEED THAT THE THAT THE PEELING
UH
I DUNNO BUT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THESE TWO TWO THINGS
SO IF IF UH THE SOLAR CELL WON'T BE VISIBLE WHILE THE BANANA IS CLOSED
THEN THE MATERIAL MUST BE ABLE TO PUT THE LIGHT INSIDE YOU KNOW
SO THAT WE CAN REACH THE ENERGY OUT OF IT OUT OF THAT
IT IS POSSIBLE BUT WELL IF IT
I DUNNO
I DUNNO HOW TO HOW TO DO IT IF IF T IF TO IF IT'S BETTER TO PUT THE SOLAR CELL TO THE T TO THE PEELING OR OUTSIDE IT
OR OR INSIDE
BUT THEN IT MUST BE SOME WINDOW THERE YOU KNOW
YEAH
I AGREE
OKAY
OKAY
HELLO
I S
NO NO YOU YOU CAN START
YEAH
THE SECOND ONE
COULD YOU PLEASE SHOW THE PRESENTATION NUMBER THREE
YEAH
THREE
YES
JUST COULD YOU PLEASE CHECK IF IT IS THE FIRST ONE OR THE SECOND
UH N N NO IT'S THE FIRST ONE
THE SECOND ONE
UH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THIS REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE APPEAR TO BE MORE EASY TO USE
I THINK UH I THINK THE FEATURE EASY TO USE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING FANCY BUT OKAY WE CAN DISCUSS ABOUT IT UH LATER
UM GENERALLY GENERALLY UH THIS REMOTE CONTROL UH UH SHOULD BE SHOULD BE SOMETHING
IN MY OPINION UH THE FIRST FEATURE IS JUST TO BE EASY TO USE
SO THE MORE FREQUENT BUTTONS SHOULD BE LARGER THEY SHOULD BE PLACED IN A GOOD POSITION UH UH INSIDE THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND UH S UH I CAN CONCLUDE LIKE THIS THAT WE SHOULDN'T NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT
IT SHOULD BE WE SHOULDN'T NEED TO ES OPEN A A T BOOK AND UH START READING AND UH LEARNING HOW TO USE THIS UH THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
SO WHAT I FOUND OUT THAT UH AS I SAID UH I THINK IT'S BETTER TO PUT UH MORE FREQUENT UH UH UH KE UH BUTTONS WHICH ARE USED MORE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEY SHOULD BE BIGGER IN SIZE
UH THE SHAPE OF REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE IN A WAY WHICH CAN WHICH SHOULD BE TAKEN EASILY IN HAND
IT SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETELY LIKE UH A CUBE
IT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD HAVE ROUND EDGE SO UH THEN IT'S EASIER
AND MAYBE UH JUST LIKE SOME TOYS SOME JOYSTICK WHICH IS EASIER TO TAKE INSIDE THE HAND
AND UH ALSO F UH UH M BECAUSE BECAUSE CUSTOMERS DOESN'T LIKE TO BUY LOTS OF BATTERY IT SHOULD NOT UH CONSUME LOTS OF ENERGY
OKAY
AND MY PERSONAL P UH PREFERENCE IS UH AS I SAID
UH JUST PUTTING THIS BUTTONS IN A SPECIAL PLACES AND COVERED SOME BUTTONS WHICH ARE NOT USED UH THAT MUCH LIKE SETTINGS BUTTON LIKE MOBILE PHONE
USUALLY SOME MOBILE PHONE COVER THE DIALLING NUMBER PART
SO WE CAN COVER THESE BUTTONS WHICH ARE NOT USED OR UH NUMBER BUTTONS FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE CAN CHANNELS
AND JUST PUT UH VOLUME CHANGE OR S CH CAN UH CHANNEL CHANGE BUTTONS UH UH IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND IF THE USER NEEDED TO DO SOME MORE COMPLEX TASK UH HE HE CAN OPEN THE COVER AND THEN CHANGE SETTINGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
UH
AND ALSO UH I THINK IF WE PUT SOME SOME SOME SOME SOME BUTTONS INSIDE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IT CAN BE USED EASIER
NOT ON REMOTE CONTROL
I DUNNO IF I CAN EXPLAIN WELL
BUT UH JUST INSIDE
FOR EXAMPLE A SLIDING OR ROLLING UH UH D UH STUFF IF WE PUT IT INSIDE THEN WE CAN EASILY MANIPULATE WITH UH THUMB
SO IT CAN BE ANOTHER UH PREFERENCE
AND UH I DUNNO BUT UH I THINK USAGE OF A SPEECH RECOGN UH R RECOGNISER CAN BE GOOD
I KNOW THAT IT CONSUMES LOTS OF ENERGY
BUT IF WE DO IT IN SOME WAY THAT IT ASLEEPS WHEN THERE IS NO SOUND AND WHEN IT DETECTS SOME SOUND IT MAY CONSUME LESS ENERGY
AND I THINK IT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING NEW AND USUALLY YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE SOMETHING NEW
SO IT MAY NOT BE VERY USEFUL BUT BECAUSE IT'S NEW PEOPLE MAY BUY IT
UH I PERSONALLY THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UH BETWEEN SOMETHING
OTHERWISE THEY PREFER TO BUY SOMETHING WHICH IS COMING FROM A FAMOUS COMPANY OR
OKAY
THAT'S MINE
MM-HMM
WELL MAYBE IT CAN HAVE TWO SHELLS A HARD SHELL INSIDE AND A SPONGY SHELL OUTSIDE
YEAH YES
MM
UH
YES
MAYBE THIS
SO BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH
HMM
MM
I THINK I THINK THEIR BEING UH LARGE OR SMALL IS NOT IMPORTANT
THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT IN UH INSIDE HAND EASILY
SO LET'S SAY AN AVERAGE SIZE OKAY AND IT SHOULD NOT BE VERY HEAVY ALSO
AND I PREFER TO IS IT SHOULDN'T HAVE A UNIFORM SHAPE SO IN THE MIDDLE IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT THINNER MAYBE MAYBE
SO WE C IT'S LIKE LIKE SOME JOYSTICKS
YOU CAN TAKE UH SOME SOME JOYSTICK YOU CAN TAKE INSIDE HAND EASIER BECAUSE IT'S IT'S DESIGNED FOR YOUR F UH TAKING INTO ACCOUNT YOUR FINGER SHAPE AND YOUR PALM SHAPE
SO THE GENERAL SHAPE SHOULD BE LIKE THIS
I THINK UH SEVEN CENTIMETRE BY SEVEN CENTIMETRE IS A LITTLE BIT LARGE
SO UH SEVEN NOT SEVEN BUT LET'S SAY FIVE BY TEN IT'S I THINK IT'S THAT'S MY OPINION
IT'S EASIER
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
OR UH OR I DON'T KNOW BUT I DON'T WANT TO NOW INVENT SOMETHING NEW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DISCUSS ABOUT IT
SO USING SOME L. C. D. S WE CAN TOUCH SO WE CAN REMOVE UH KEYS AND JUST UH HAVING UH I DUNNO THE NAME L. C. D. RESPONDING TO FINGERS
TOUCHING THE SCREEN
SOMETHING LIKE MM LIKE TACTILE
SO BUT FOR NOW IF WE DON'T WANT TO USE SUCH KIND OF SCREENS I I THINK WE USING A A SMALLER SCREEN IS BETTER BECAUSE
A SMALLER S
OKAY
I THINK THIS IS NOT GOOD
MM
MM
OKAY
YEAH I THINK INFRA RED
YEAH PEELING OF THE BANANA
YEAH
MM
YEAH
UH
MM-HMM
YEAH SOME
SOMETHING LIKE A PLASTIC COVER COVERING UH SOME INTERFACE U. S. B. INTERFACE AS IN THE IN UH DIGITAL CAMERA
IF YOU SEE IT'S LIKE PEELING
YOU OPEN A PLASTIC COVER AND YOU SEE SOME U. S. B. INTERFACES SOME SOME INTERFACES FOR ADAPTOR
SO KEYS CAN BE UH BUTTONS CAN BE COVERED LIKE THIS
WITH A PLASTIC COVER AND UH WHEN UH AND WHEN YOU OPEN THIS COVER IT'S LIKE PEELING A BANANA
SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S A LIC LIKE A PLASTIC COVER SO
MM-HMM
YES YEAH IT'S A GOOD IDEA
MAGNETIC
MM
YEAH OR A YEAH IT CAN IS IT CAN BE A PLASTIC COVER UH STICKING TO THE TO THE ALL THE STUFF LIKE UH WITH MAGNETIC P UH MAGNETIC UH MAGNETIC UH MATERIALS IN THE BORDER
SO IT'S IT STICKS LIKE REFRIGERATOR DOOR COMPLETELY
AND WHEN YOU TRY TO OPEN IT IT WILL BE OPENED EASILY
SO YOU YOU CAN BE SURE THAT IT WILL NOT BE OPEN WHILE YOU'RE UH WHILE WHILE UH YOU ARE COMMONLY USING UH BUTTONS ON THE BANANA
MM
MM
MM
YES I THINK
I THINK SO
MM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
THANK YOU
HELLO
OKAY
OKAY I'LL START
CAN YOU OPEN MY PRESENTATION PLEASE
I'M NUMBER FOUR
TREND
YEP
CAN YOU PASS THE MOUSE PLEASE
OH OKAY THAT'S FINE
OKAY
UM SO BASICALLY I JUST WANT TO PRESENTED TO YOU PRESENT TO YOU SOME RECENT RESULTS WE'VE HAD FROM UM LOOKING AT UH UM SOME REMOTE CONTROL MARKET RESEARCH AND SOME FASHION TRENDS AROUND THE WORLD
UM
THE FASHION TRENDS WE GOT FROM TALKING TO OUR OUR CONTACTS IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY BASED IN PARIS AND MILAN
UM SO F FROM OUR MARKET RESEARCH BASICALLY WE'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
UM AS OPPOSED TO A FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
UM FANCY IS IS IS IS THE YOU KNOW HIGHEST PRIORITY
SECONDLY UM THAT OUR REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO BE TECHN TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
UM SO THIS IS T NUMBER TWO PRIORITY BUT IT'S TWO TIMES LESS IMPORTANT AS THE FANCY CRITERIA
UM AND THIRD THIRDLY THE EASINESS OF USE IS IS THE UM IS IS IMPORTANT AS WELL
BUT AGAIN TWO TIMES LESS IMPORTANT AS THE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVENESS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
FROM OUR F FASHION PEOPLE IN PARIS AND MILAN
UM WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT THIS YEAR UM FRUIT THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE MOTIF WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN IN CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE
SO I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT OUR REMOTE CONTROL FITS INTO THE FURNITURE CATEGORY
AND ALSO UM THE FEEL OF MATERIAL THIS YEAR UM IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY
UM SO HOPEFULLY OUR REMOTE CONTROL REFLECTS THAT S IN SOME WAY
UH SORT OF UM SQUISHY
UM
YEAH SOFT LIKE A UH LIKE A SPONGE
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
UM SO IN CONCLUSION WE NEED A OUR REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY FANCY UM HAS LOTS OF TECHNOLOG TECH TECHNOLOGY IN IT
UM SOMEHOW WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE IT RELATED TO FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WITH A SPONGY FEEL
AND THAT IT'S EASY TO USE AND FROM OUR LAST MEETING OUR YOU KNOW FABIAN TOLD US THAT W YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT WE HAVE TO REFLECT THE LOOK AND FEEL OF OUR OF TH THE REAL REACTION COMPANY
UM
THAT'S IT
LESS IMPORTANT
SO UM FANCINESS FIRST AND THEN TWO TI YOU KNOW HALF AS IMPORTANT AS THAT IS TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY AND HALF IMPORTANT AS TECHNOLOGY IS EASY TO USE
SO
INCH
SO
SO
CA
CAN I ASK A QUESTION
THIS SEVEN INCH T. F. T. SCREEN HOW BIG IS IT IN REALITY
SO LIKE THAT
THAT'S QUITE BIG
UH UH HAVE WE DECIDED THAT WE'RE GONNA USE THIS T. F. T. SCREEN
BUT I MEAN EVEN EVEN THAT IS LIKE THIS BIG
YEAH
YOU CAN CUT THE T. F. T. SCREEN
OKAY SO
OKAY
SO WHAT'S THE SIZE OF THE DEVICE
EVEN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SEVEN T SEVEN CENTIMETRES BY SEVEN CENTIMETRES IS STILL
IS IT CAN YOU HOLD THAT OR
YEAH A SMALL C CONTROL THAT THEY CAN HOLD IN HAND
BUT IS SOMETHING THAT'S SEVEN CENTIMETRES SQUARE E EASY TO HOLD
OKAY
SO IF WE USE S SOLAR CELLS UM WHERE IS THE SUN IF SOMEONE'S WATCHING T. V. INSIDE
OKAY
OKAY
IT'S IT'S QUITE INNOVATIVE YES
AND IF YOU WATCH T. V. OUTSIDE IT'S VERY USEFUL
WHICH IS THE SAME AREA
COULD YOU RE COULD YOU REDESIGN YOUR BOARD
OH FIVE FIVE CENTIMETRES BY TEN CENTIMETRES
YEAH
MM TOUCH SCREEN
SO
WELL IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY THE OBVIOUS CHOICE WITH THE COLOUR OF OUR COMPANY
I MEAN WHAT OTHER WHAT OTHER FRUIT AND VEGETABLES DO YOU KNOW OF ANY ANY OTHER FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THAT ARE YELLOW
WELL
I'D LIKE A SHAPED SCREEN
I THINK THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN SAVING A BIT OF MONEY ON ON THE T. F. T. SCREEN
YEAH BANANA'S GOOD
OKAY
I THINK IF WE IF WE HAVE A SPONGY LAYER ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BANANA THEN IT'S EASY TO MAKE THAT
YOU KNOW TO MANIPULATE THAT TO HAV BE A COVER THAT YOU CAN PULL OFF AND
I THINK FOR SURE
DEFINITELY
THE SOFTER THE BETTER
YEAH
WE COULD USE VELCRO
OR UH MA MAYBE A MAGNETIC
THING
YEAH I IMAGINE SOME SORT OF VINYL THING
IN A IN A SORT OF A WITH A SUEDE SORT OF FEEL
MAYBE
MM
SO YOU'RE SAYING IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A SOLAR CELL AND THIS REMOVABLE COVER AND
AND A AND A BANANA
YEAH
OKAY
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
I THINK ONE OF OUR P PRIORITIES IS TECH TECHNOLOGY
AND
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
THANK YOU
SO HELLO EVERYONE
WE'RE HERE TO HAVE A KICK OFF MEETING FOR THE DESIGN OF A F FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEW PROJECT UM UH REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE DESIGN FOR A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER CHRISTA PAVLOV AND OKAY LET'S BEGIN
SO
I'M FIRST GOING TO DO AN OPENING THEN WE GET USED TO ONE ANOTHERS AND WE SPEAK ABOUT THIS TOOL WE'RE GOING TO DESIGN AND TRY TO MAKE A PROJECT PLAN
SOME DISCUSSION AND THEN WE TALK OF UH THE NEXT MEETING
SO UM WE WANT TO TO DO A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
IT HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
UM I THINK THE IMPORTANT POINTS WE HAVE TO T TALK ABOUT ARE UH IT'S FUNCTIONAL DESIGN IT'S CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DESAIL DETAILED DESIGN
AND FOR THAT WE'RE GOING UM ALL TO WORK INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN HAVE MEETING DURING THE WHOLE DAY
UM SO LET'S TRY THE WHITEBOARD
UM SO ANY OF YOU WHO WANT TO GO
WOW
A RABBIT
A RABBIT
YOU WANT TO GO
A HUMAN AH
MM I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO YEAH
HMM
IS THAT A WORM
OR
UH YEAH CHRISTA PAVLOV MM
SMILING FISH
MM-HMM
YEAH
NEXT
LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY
SO
YEAH MM THAT'S THE PRICE WE WANT TO THAT'S THE AIM FOR THE PRICE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE AIM TO DO THIS PROFIT
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM FOR A PRODUCTION COST OF MM TWELVE FIFTY EUROS MAXIMUM
'KAY
SO ANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE IN REMOTE CONTROLS
THAT
SO THAT COULD BE A GREAT UM APPLICATION
REMOTE CONTROLS CHILDREN PROOF
MM MM-HMM
OKAY
SO THEY HAVE TO BE WATERPROOF MAYBE
'CAUSE THEY EAT SHE ATE IT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
COLOURFUL YEAH MM
NO THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
MM MM MM
YEAH
NO BECAUSE YOU THINK WHY NOT
MM-HMM
GOOD IDEA
SMALL ALSO
DON'T YOU THINK
NO UH NOT TOO MUCH BUTTONS OR MM
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S
OKAY
SO I THINK THERE'S
SO YOU YOU THINK IT'S BETTER IF SMALL
THAN BIGGER
NO NOT TOO SMALL YEAH
HMM
OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
MM
SO SOME KIND OF IDEA UH WITH UM UM CELLULAR PHONE WITH A A SCREEN THAT WILL TELL YOU WHAT NO
OKAY
AND TOO EXPENSIVE
MM
MM MM
MM-HMM
MM MM MM
SO ADAPTABLE YEAH SOMETHING YEAH
THREE OPTION
UM
MM-HMM
MAYBE IF IT'S MORE IF THERE IS A SOFTWARE INSIDE THAT ASK YOU THREE
HMM
IF IT IF WE WANT A R UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL THAT WE SA LIKE WE SAY BEFORE IT MAY
MAY NEED MORE THAN THREE MM THREE BUTTON THREE MM POSSIBILITIES YE YEAH
MM
YEAH
I CHANGE CHANNEL LIKE THIS M UH I WANT TO GO TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN TO TEN UH-HUH MM YEAH
ALSO WE CAN BE HERE YEAH THAT WOULD BE COOL
MM YEAH
MM MM
OKAY
SO I THINK WE HAVE FULL OF IDEA
UM WE'RE GOING TO MEET AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES AND UH I WANT YOU TO MM
WORK ON THESE IDEAS AND TRY TO MAKE A
UH THE ONES MAKE UM TO DECIDE WHAT WHAT ARE THE ONES IMPORTANT AND WHAT ARE THE ONE THAT WE DON'T WANT
AND UM M MAYBE MORE IN THE TECHNICAL PARTS WHAT UH DO WE WANT TO DO
UM
SO UM YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL SEND YOU SOME INSTRUCTION FOR FOR THIS THIRTY MINUTES
MM
MM-HMM
MM OKAY
SO
I THINK THAT'S ALL
YEAH
SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
OOPS
YEAH FOR FAVOURITE ANIMALS
IT'S GONNA BE NOT MY FAVOURITE ONE BUT THE ONE I CAN DRAW
AND IT'S GONNA BE YOU'LL TRY TO GUESS
NO
YES THAT'S A RABBIT
THAT'S MY FAVOURITE ONE
THAT'S IT
HMM
WOW
NO
WOW
THAT'S COBRA
NO IT JUST SMALL COBRA YEAH
IT'S CO C QUITE RECOGNISABLE
CHRISTA CHRISTA
HMM
OKAY
JUST TR TRY TO GUESS WHO IS A USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
ACCORDING TO THE DRAWINGS
OKAY
ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET
WOW
MM
TO EAT
CHILDREN PROOF
HMM
OKAY UNBREAKABLE
UH-HUH
COLOURFUL
THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL
NO
BUT HOW GONNA OKAY JUST UH BUT IT'S UH MONOCHROME IT'S N IT'S NOT LIKE
OTHERWISE YOU WILL NEVER FIND IT
COOL
CH
YEAH BUT WITHOUT ANY EXTREMES LIKE N NOT OF THIS SIZE NOT TOO LARGE
OKAY
YEAH LIKE A PALM SIZED
JUST TO HOLD IT
NO NO SCREENS IT'S TOO COMPLEX
AND N MAYBE NOT TOO EXPENSIVE WELL IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM BUT WELL OKAY
BUT NO SCREENS ON REMOTE CONTROLS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM-HMM
ADAPTABLE
ALRIGHT GOOD SO HOW MANY ACTIONS DO WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT IN IT
ON OFF
I MEAN IF IT'S LESS THAN THREE UH THEN WE CAN MAKE IT UH LIKE A
LIKE THREE MENTAL STATES YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WE CAN JUST MAKE IT UH
CONTROLLED BY A BRAIN HUH
MM-HMM
SH SURE SURE
BUT FOR STANDARD ACTIONS YOU USUALLY WHAT DO YOU DO YOU CHANGE CHANNELS YOU ADJUST VOLUME AND NOTHING ELSE
MM-HMM
YOU DO THIS
I USUALLY JUST CHANGE CHANNELS
UH-HUH
GO BACK BUTTON IS GOOD
I ONCE HAD IT
MM-HMM
HISTORY
MARKET EXPERT
OKAY
THANK YOU EVERYBODY
NO
RABBIT
YOU WA
IS THE WHITE OKAY
I GUESS YOU CAN
YEAH UH NOT REALLY
SMALL COBRA
CHRIS
MM
SMILE FISH
YEAH
YEAH YOU'RE
HMM
YEAH WE'RE TO SELL TWO MILLION THEN
MM YEAH
YEAH PRET
YEAH
AH
YEAH WE HAVE SOME CHILD LOCK OR SOMETHING YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT'S ALWAYS BLACK OR YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH EVEN WE CAN CHANGE COLOURS NO
LIKE THE UH LIKE THE PHONES AND THESE THINGS WE C YEAH
AT LEAST FOR CHILDREN LIKE ONE COLOUR AND
AND IT SHOULD BE REALLY SMALL AND
HUH NOT SO BIG LIKE YEAH
YEAH NOT TOO MUCH BUTTONS AND
UH
YEAH
YEAH
COLOUR SIZE SH
YEAH MAYBE AT LEAST N NOT BIGGER THAN THIS I GUESS
YEAH YEAH AT LEAST IT SHOULD HOLD IN YOUR HAND N PROPERLY LIKE
YEAH
UH MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE THE COLOURS THAT AT LEAST THE FRAME
MM
S SO THEN IT DEPENDS YOU ARE TO
MM I MEAN YOU C YOU CAN EASILY REMOVE THE FRAME
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
TOO EXPENSIVE YEAH
YE YEAH
HMM
I MEAN IT IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE TWO TYPES NO
PEOPLE ARE RIGHT HANDED OR LEFT HANDED SO Y BECAUSE I AM LEFT HANDED I USE LIKE THIS
SAY IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED YOU USE LIKE THIS OR SO THA YOUR SWITCH ON AND OFF SHOULD BE ON YEAH
MM HUH
MAYBE I THINK EVEN WE CAN KEEP TWO SWITCHES AND THEN WE CAN UH ONLY MAKE ONE WORKING
WE CAN ADAPT ONLY ONE SWITCH SUPPOSE HERE LIKE WE CAN MAKE TWO SWITCHES AND IF I'M LEFT HANDER I USE THIS SWITCH TO FOLLOW THE MAIN OPERATIONS
TWO
YEAH
YEAH
MM YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THEY KEEP GENERALLY THEIR T SLASH SLASH UH THIS THING AND THEN THE DASH DASH AND THEN YOU CAN PUT YEAH YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE BIT
DASH
YEAH YOU CAN YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH THE PREVIOUS BUTTON IS
UH OKAY
OH UH
UH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH WHAT THE WHICH CHANNELS THE VIEWER
MARKETING YEAH
THANK YOU
WOW
WOW
COMPLEX
HUH
A CAT
NO
DARN
UH
A WHAT
A R A RABBIT OH OH YEAH WHERE IS THE CARROT
OKAY MM-HMM
I AM NOT VERY GOOD AT UH THIS KIND OF STUFF
MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS
GUESS
A HUMAN YAY
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ANIMAL AND UM YEAH
CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS THIS ANIMAL IS DANGEROUS
AH A KIND OF UH SNAKE
COBRA
EXACTLY
UH-HUH
WHAT ABOUT YOU UH CHRISTA
A FISH
A SMILING FISH
MM-HMM
SO W WHITEBOARD IS WORKING
GOOD
NEXT
YEAH WELL
NOT ME
SO
TWENTY FIVE EURO FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
'TIS BIG NUMBER
MM-HMM
UH YES WE HAVE PLENTY AT HOME
IN FACT MY DAUGHTER LIKES L REMOTE CONTROLS
TO EAT
YEAH MAINLY AND TO BREAK
MM-HMM
YEAH
YE YE YEAH
SO SHE LIKES UH BUTTONS WHICH MAKE CLICK SO IT HAS TO CLICK
IT HAS TO BE UH WHA BABY PROOF YEAH BUT MAINLY IT HAS TO BE VERY ROBUST BECAUSE EVEN IF SHE'S NOT VERY TALL SHE'S UH HIGH ENOUGH SO THAT UH WHEN SHE THROW IT AWAY IT'S UH
SO IT HAS TO BE VERY ROBUST
UNBREAKABLE YEAH
MM-HMM
AND UH
IT HAS TO BE NICE LOOKING
COLOURFUL MAYBE
COLOURFUL BECAUSE UH NOBODY HAS COLOURFUL REMOTE CONTROL THEY'RE ALWAYS BLACK YEAH BUT THIS ONE COULD BE I DUNNO PURPLE OR B
YEAH YEAH
ONE COLOUR
YEAH YEAH
OH LIKE THE PHONES YEAH IT COULD CHANGE COLOURS YEAH
YEAH
GOOD
SHOULD IT BE
Y YOU KNOW THESE UH REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE UM THEY ARE WHAT THEY CALL A UNIVERSAL RET REMOTE CONTROL SO Y YOU CAN DECIDE THAT NOW IT'S THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE TELEVISION
THEN IT'S THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR THE THE SOUND SYSTEM OR FOR YOUR REFRIGERATOR WHATEVER I DUNNO IF IT'S
OR IF WE SHOULD HAVE A TARGETED RE REMOTE CONTROL
SO COLOUR ROBUSTNESS EASY TO USE SIZE YEAH SIZE MATTERS YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM
BUT UH WHAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THIS FROM THE OTHERS
I DUNNO IF
YEAH AT LEAST THE COLOUR WOULD BE DIFFERENT
I THINK ONE THING IMPORTANT FOR INSTANCE IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE USE IT THEY'RE THEY NEVER FIND A GOOD BUTTON IN THE RIGHT PLACE
FOR SOME REASON THEY THEY THEY CLICK THE OFF BUTTON WHEN THEY WANT TO USE THE
SO THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE DESIGN OF THAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL SOMEHOW I DUNNO
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR TWELVE EURO
AH
MM-HMM
I THOUGHT IT COULD BE ONLY A SCREEN WHICH WOULD CHANGE DEPENDING ON UH UH THE USE OR EVEN THE USER
SO MA I PREFER TO HAVE THE OFF BUTTON AT THE TOP RIGHT
SO I WOULD HAVE MY OWN DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S IN FACT JUST A A FULL TOUCH SCREEN REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU IF YOU LIKE
I DON'T KNOW IF IT MAKES SENSE BUT
YEAH FOR INSTANCE MM
MM
MAYBE IF IF IT'S POSSIBLE YEAH
YEAH
THREE BUTTONS YOU MEAN
AH
MM-HMM YEAH SURE
YEAH MORE THAN THREE ACTIONS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DO AT A GIVEN TIME
YEAH BUT FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU CHANGE CHANNELS YOU CAN HAVE YOU CAN JUST GO TO THE NEXT ONE OR GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE
AND THAT'S ALREADY MORE COMPLEX TO GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE
UH NO
BECAUSE I'M ONLY USING THREE OR FOUR CHANNELS BUT
AND THEN BACK TO THE ONE I WAS BEFORE SO THERE'S WHICHEVER IT WAS
YEAH
UH UH WE HAD THAT IN IN OTHER COUNTRIES
YEAH E EVEN THE HISTORY SO YOU COULD LIKE UH UNDO PREVIOUS OF THE PREVIOUS
THEN YOU CAN WATCH WHAT YOUR AH YOU COULD ALSO RECORD YOUR RECORD YOUR SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS
THAT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX BUT YOU COULD LOOK AT WHAT UH THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE USED THERE OR REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH MAYBE IT'S A
OKAY
SO WHAT DOES M. E. MEANS
M. E. THE USER REQUIREMENTS
OR THAT'S UH THAT'S FOR US
UH THAT'S ME
OH OF COURSE YEAH THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS UH-HUH YEAH
OKAY
I'LL THINK OF THAT
SO
MEETING'S OVER
GREAT
THANK YOU
SO
I HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR THIS UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING
UM SO I WILL TAKE THE MINUTES YOU MM YOU THREE ARE GOING TO DO PRESENTATION
UM UH WE WANT TO KNOW TO AT THE END TO KNOW THE NEW PROJECT'S REQUIREMENT SO WE NEED UH TO KNOW THE THE USER UH NEEDS THAT WE WANT TO FULFIL TO FULFIL THE FROM THE TECHNICAL PART WE WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GOING TO WORK AND UM
THIRD PART UH I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH IS NOT VERY GOOD
AH OF COURSE HOW TO TO DESIGN THIS UH THIS YEAH
SO
UM LET'S GO FOR THE THREE PRESENTATIONS SO FIRST UM MARKETING EXPERT
SO WAIT A MINUTE
MM
SOUNDS UH
MM UH
HMM
OKAY
F. FIVE
MM-HMM
MM
WHY NOT
OKAY UH THA THAT'S LOOK GREAT
MM-HMM
OKAY
OR SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
OKAY
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT WE UH DON'T CONSIDER TELETEXT THAT IT'S OUT OF DATE NOW BECAUSE OF INTERNET
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM MM
OKAY
MM I THINK IT'S GOOD OKAY
YOU DONE A GOOD REVIEW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM MM MM
OKAY
THAT'S GOOD POINT
OKAY
SO UM NOW I THINK IT'S THE TURN OF THE
THE I'M NOT SURE UM
OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION SO
UH
WHAT EFFECT
OKAY
WAIT A SECOND
ARGH
SO YOU'RE
OKAY
LET'S GO
OH SORRY
OKAY
OH SORRY
IT'S OFF
IT'S ON
OR YOU WANT TO GO TO THE KITCHEN
MM
UM I SEE THAT YOU TARGET UH SEVERAL S APPLICATION NOT ONLY T. V. BUT I LIKE WE TALK ABOUT UM UNIVERSAL UH REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
S
MM
SINCE WE WERE TARGETING A REALLY SOON UH UH DATE FOR THE THE THE UM I ISSUING OF THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL I THINK WE WILL ONLY CONCENTRATE ON T. V. FOR THE MOMENT AND THEN MAYBE M MAKE IT MORE GENERALISED YEAH
YEAH IT'S IT'S THE SAME SOLUTION I THINK
HMM
YEAH UH ON ZAP IT'S ONLY NEXT NEXT NEXT NEXT NEXT YEAH
MM-HMM
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE UH DIFFERENT MODES FOR EACH BUTTON AND YOU CAN CHANGE MODE ZAPPING MODE OR
UH CURRENT CHAN
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
UH YOU'RE FINISH
OKAY
SO NOW THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THIS NEW DEVICE
MM
YOU PREFER IT
MM-HMM
OKAY
TO MAKE IT QUITE UH AN UNIVERSAL UH DEVICE UH
MM
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND FROM FROM THE DISCUSSION WE HAD DO YOU CAN YOU MAKE IT ON THE WHITEBOARD OR MM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
ON
UH TRAIN IT OKAY
MM-HMM
MM
AND WHAT ABOUT THE PRICE OF THIS COMPONENT
IT MM OKAY
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WITH A KEYWORDS AND YEAH
MM-HMM MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
NO IN NO NOT ONLY SPEECH YEAH
I IT'S AN OPTION
OKAY
SHO TO TO TRAIN OKAY
MM
AND WELL WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA OF AUTOMATIC ON OFF ON THE BUTTON YEAH
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE UH ARGUMENTS
I WANT UH
AND WE CAN INCREASE THIS THE STRENGTH Y YOU CAN BUY ONE WITH
MM-HMM
OKAY
YOU HAVE MM SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY
UH
NO
OKAY THANKS
SO
MM
MM I THINK OKAY WE'RE JUST ON TIME
UM MM MM
SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO L HAVE THE LUNCH BREAK
THEN WE WILL WORK AGAIN FOR THIRTY MINUTES INDIVIDUAL WORK AND UM
WE WILL UH MEET AGAIN FOR THE NEXT MEETING AND UH IN THIS ONE WANT TO
TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS THE UM ON THE COMPONENTS SO
UH
YOU WILL FOCUS ON THE COMPONENT CONCEPT UM
UH OF COURSE THE U. I. D. MARK WILL BE UH FOCUSED ON THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT AND UH OUR M MARKET EXPERT SAMMY BENJO UH ON THE TREND WATCHING
SO UM OF COURSE LIKE BEFORE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL PERSONAL COACH
WELL I THINK THAT'S ALL
AND WE HAVE UM MAYBE WE HAVE TO WE SAY ONLY FOR T. V. NOT TELETEXT
UH I THINK AUTOMATIC ON OFF CONTROL UH IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
YEAH MAYBE IN THE NEXT UH STEP IF WE MAKE IT WORK UM
YEAH IMPLEMENTED
O OKAY WE CAN THINK ABOUT THAT
AND UM
DO YOU SEE SOMETHING ELSE
UH YEAH THAT'S
OR MAYBE YOU WANT TO PHONE HIM
SINCE NOW ALL YEAH
THINK
UH-HUH
AND UH
AND IT'S ANSWERED
CLAP CLAP CLAP IT'S A GOOD I I THINK IT'S UNIVERSAL
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WITHOUT HAND
YEAH
MM UH OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM SO LET'S TO THINK S SO THAT YEAH
I THINK THAT COULD BE IN THE COMPONENT UH CONCEPT UH
IT YES
OKAY
SO YEAH LET'S GO TO LUNCH
SAMMY BENJO
I KNOW THIS NAME UH
WE MET BEFORE
F. F. FIVE
AGREE
R. S. I. MM-HMM
NO I DON'T THINK SO
OKAY
BUT TWENTY SIX PERCENT DO YOU KNOW
TWENTY FIVE
EVERY FOURTH YOU KNOW
EVERY FOUR SOME OF US KNOWS
ONE OF US
MM-HMM
FUNCTIONS
MM-HMM
I GOT ONE QUESTION UH YOU ARE A MARKET EXPERT SO SHOULD WE AIM AT THE YOUNG PEOPLE OR NOT
OKAY THEN TELETEXT IS USED LESS
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
OKAY
THAT'S ME
THAT'S BUT THIS BUT NUMBER THREE YES
MM-HMM
SO MY NAME IS MARK DWIGHT AND UM I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR USER INTERFACE DESIGN
HOWEVER UH MM PROJECT MANAGER ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU SOME PRESENTATION ABOUT TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
UH AS I'M A MORE AN ARTIST THAT'S GONNA BE LESS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS BUT MORE USER INTERFACE AND CURRENT INTENTIONS AND EVERYTHING WHICH IS LINKED WITH THIS
SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
AND UH A GENERAL METHOD WHICH IS SEEMS TO BE VERY USEFUL FOR OUR TASK IS NOT TO FORGET ABOUT UH OCCAM RAZOR
WE SHOULD NEVER COMPLICATE THINGS TOO MUCH
WE SHOULD ONLY MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL NOTHING MORE
NOTHING MORE THAN THIS JUST A REMOTE CONTROL
'CAUSE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THEY ARE NEVER EASY ENOUGH TO USE
SO MAKE A CLICK PLEASE
SO HERE IS THIS REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S QUITE A STANDARD ONE BUT IT'S NOT FROM A T. V. IT'S FROM A MUCH
EASIER DEVICE LIKE AIR CONDITIONING OR SOMETHING
BUT YOU KNOW WE CAN USE IT FOR A T. V. EASILY
ONLY BUTTONS WE NEED IS ON OFF VOLUME CHANNELS AND MAYBE SOME OPTIONS OR SOMETHING ELSE AND PLEASE MAKE A CLICK COMPARED TO THIS ONE
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU PREFER
I GUESS THIS
SURE SURE
YEAH AND OUR METHOD IS GOING TO BE PROVIDE SIMPLE
SIMPLE DESIRES INTO SIMPLE ACTIONS
FINDINGS
OUR QUESTION OF THE STYLE WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT OUR COMPANY
PUTS FASHION INTO ELECTRONICS
AND WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT IT
CONCEPT
BE SIMPLE
BE SIMPLE AND YOU'LL LEAN ON THIS MARKET
MARKET IS A OF REMOTE CONTROLS YOU KNOW IT BETTER IT'S VERY
WELL IT'S
IT'S NOT AN EASY FIELD TO TO PLAY YOU KNOW
SO BE SIMPLE
FOR PERSONAL PREFERENCES I THINK THAT TO MAKE A BABY PROOF REMOTE CONTROL IT GOT TO BE A TITANIUM
IT'S A REALLY GOOD STYLE IT GOING TO BE LOOK LIKE LIKE THIS
IT IS UNBREAKABLE AND IT IS VERY UNIVERSAL
W WE'LL HAVE A SCREEN WITH A BACK LIGHT WHICH CAN CHANGE COLOURS
AND WE CAN PUT ALL THE OPTIONS INTO THIS SCREEN
WE'LL NEED ONLY FEW BUTTONS
ALL THE OTHER THINGS CAN BE CONTROLLED THROUGH THE SCREEN
AND ALL THESE BUTTONS SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND AND TO CLICK 'CAUSE WHEN YOU WATCH A MOVIE AND YOU WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING
YOU ALWAYS TRY TO FIND A GOOD BUTTON AND CLICK IT BUT YOU SHOULD DO IT BY TOUCHING IT AND FINDING IT EASILY JUST BY TOUCH
SO
PRESS
I WOULD PROPOSE THIS CONCEPT FOR DESIGN JUST FEW BUTTONS A SCREEN WITH A BACK LIGHT WHICH CAN CHANGE COLOURS TITANIUM
I THINK AND UH WHAT ELSE
I GOT JUST VERY FEW AND GOOD IDEAS
WE NEED POWER AND VOLUME
AND LET US INCLUDE TWO NICE FEATURES INTO THIS DEVICE FIRST POWER ON AND OFF CAN BE MADE FULLY AUTOMATIC
WHEN YOU GO TO THE SOFA TAKE YOUR CONTROL AND POINT IT TO THE T. V.
THE T. V. TURNS ON
WHEN YOU DON'T TOUCH THE CONTROL BUT YOU GO OUT OF THE
FOR FOR ENOUGH TIME LIKE UH YOU
IT'S A QUESTION TO OUR TECHNICAL DESIGN OUR TWO ENGINEERS
AND ANOTHER NICE FEATURE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT IS UH VOLUME CONTROL
SUPPOSE YOU SET U YOU SET UP SOME VOLUME AND THEN YOU MOVE OUT OR YOU MOVE TO THE OTHER CORNER OF THE ROOM AND TAKE YOUR CONTROL WITH YOU
LIKE YOU WANT TO TO CHANGE THE CHAIR OR YOU WANT TO MOVE TO THE ARMCHAIR FROM THE SOFA OR SOMETHING AND THEN THE VOLUME CHANGES
IT'S EASY TO DO YOU JUST CONTROL THE
ACCORDING TO THE DISTANCE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
SO
I THINK IT CAN BE JUST A MENU WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED WITH A LEFT RIGHT UP DOWN AND ENTER
SO ITS MAIN PURPOSE IN FACT IS A BACK LIGHT WHICH CHANGE COLOURS WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO FIND
AND EACH CAN IT CAN RESPOND FOR YOUR VOICE LIKE IT CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT FOR YOU JUST TO F FIND IT EASILY YEAH
SO BASICALLY THAT'S IT
CAN BE EASILY DONE 'CAUSE
YOU GOT SIMPLE DESIGNS Y WE SHOULD PUT IT TO SIMPLE ACTIONS
LET IT BE UNIVERSAL SO YOU WANT TO USE IT FOR YOUR HI FI SYSTEM
YOU WANT TO CHANGE TRACKS AND YOU WANT TO ADJUST VOLUME
JUST FEW ACTIONS A FEW ACTIONS FOR EVERYTHING
ALL THE REST WE SH WE'LL PUT IT INTO THIS MENU ON THE SCREEN
OKAY OKAY
OKAY BUT IT'S QUITE UNIVERSAL YOU KNOW
WE CAN JUST EXTEND IT TO ANY DEVICE
UH TWENTY FIVE
MM-HMM
IN FACT I WOULD PROPOSE ANOTHER SOLUTION
BASICALLY YOU USE JUST FOUR OR FIVE CHANNELS RIGHT
YEAH
SO UH SET UP YOUR T. V. SET LIKE CHANNELS THAT YOU USE THEY'RE ONE
TWO THREE AND FIVE AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO GO TO A TWENTY FIVES CHANNEL
MM-HMM
MM
WE GOT THESE BUTTONS HERE
NEXT NEXT
OR SAY THIS CAN BE BACK
COULD WE CARRY OUT SOME RESEARCH IF WE W REALLY NEED THIS
LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO GO TO CHANNEL NUMBER TWENTY FIVE AND THEN TO SIXTY FOUR
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION
TOO COMPLEX
OKAY
OKAY
UM
OKAY
NO YOU KNOW IT'S A CONCEPTUAL QUESTION
'CAUSE NOW I SEE TH THIS THE PICTURE IN FRONT OF MY EYES LIKE A USER TAKING HIS REMOTE CONTROL AND SHOUTING INTO IT
VOLUME UP VOLUME UP AND AND HE'S COMING YOU KNOW HE'S REALLY ANNOYED WITH THIS DOWN UP DOWN
OKAY FOR THIS BUDGET LIKE TWELVE EUROS
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM MM-HMM
DID YOU CONSIDER THE R GEST UH GESTURE RECOGNITION
LIKE IF I WANT TO PUT VOLUME UP I LIKE DO MM I TAKE MY REMOTE CONTROL DO LIKE SOMETHING LIKE
ROLL 'EM UP OR ROLL 'EM DOWN
MM WHY
THAT'S JUST
WE GOT A REALLY GOOD MARKET EXPERT
LET'S SEND MORE LET'S SELL MORE
OKAY
UH SHOULD IT BE EQUIPPED WITH THE
UH WITH UH SPEAKERS
LIKE YOU WANT TO FIND IT YOU SHOUT
CONTROL AND IT ANSWERS IS I'M HERE
OR
JUST BEEPS
I CAN'T WHISTLE
NO NO I CAN'T
MM
OKAY
JUST DON'T INTERFERE WITH OTHER DEVICES LIKE 'CAUSE LIKE ALL THESE PEOPLE DO THAT THEIR LIGHTS ARE TURNING ON WITH CLAPPING
YEAH I GOT IT AT MY HOME LIKE
OOPS
YEAH IT IS PUT F. FIVE
THE FULL PAGE PRESENTATION YEP
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU CAN YOU ARE
HMM
YEAH IT'S ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES OR SOMETHING KIND OF MAYBE UH EFFECT
YEAH BECAUSE INFRARED USES SOME ELECTROMAGNETIC TECHNOLOGY AND THOSE WAVES HAVE HIGH
UH
UH
YEAH IT'S
PEOPLE REALLY
YEAH
YEAH
UH
HMM
YEAH
'CAUSE
THANK YOU
MM
MM
MM YEP
THANK YOU
UH IT'S
TECHNI FUNCTION OF
YEAH
I HAVE TO DO WORKING DESIGN SO UH
MM
IT'S
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE IT CAN BE YEAH MIDDLE OF LIKE BETWEEN THOSE TWO LI
S YOU SHOULD YEAH
MM
DISTANCE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM
MM
YEAH AND IT MM
MM
MM
YEAH
BUT EVEN WE CAN HAVE SOME UH L. C. D. DISPLAY LIKE YOU CAN UH DE YOU CAN JUST BUTTON THE NUMBER AND THEN IT GO T BECAUSE
YEAH
BUT STILL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT OTHERWISE LIKE WE CAN PUT SOME DISPLAY ON NUMBERS AND THEN THEY CAN JUST PRESS SUPPOSE TWO FIVE THEY JUST PRESS TWO AND FIVE AND THEN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT SINCE WE ARE FOCUSING ONLY ON T. V. REMOTE CONTROLS SO WE CAN HAVE MORE FUNCTIONS FOR T. V. UH IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR A UNIVERSAL THEN WE OUGHT TO LIMIT FOR FUNCTIONS FOR EACH OF OUR DEVICES
YEAH
YEAH
TWO
YEAH IF
SORRY
YEAH
UH AS YOU KNOW I AM MISTER RAMARO
I AM AN EXPERT IN UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGN OF ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND I PREVIOUSLY DEVISED MANY UH LIKE DIGITAL CALCULATORS AND ELECTRONIC CALCULATORS
SO NOW I'LL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE WORKING DESIGN OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL
WELL AS YOU KNOW THE BASIC FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS SENDING SOME MESSAGE TO THE THE DEVICE LIKE T. V. OR V. C. R. OR D. V. D. PLAYER ETCETERA
SO WE WILL HAVE A P PORTABLE DEVICE WHICH WILL SEND MESSAGE TO THE THE MAIN DEVICE LIKE T. V.
SO WE NEED TO HAVE SOME ENERGY SOURCE TO DO WHAT TO DO THE FUNCTIONS WHAT WE WANT ON THIS PORTABLE DEVICE
AND USUALLY THIS SO TO DO THESE FUNCTIONS WE NEED AN INTERFACE WHICH BASICALLY SOME KIND OF PRESSING BUTTONS OR KEYS OR LIKE MOVING JACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THEN THESE MESSAGES THESE KEY BUTTONS CAN BE TRANSFERRED INTO SOME KIND OF MESSAGE AND THEN IT WILL PROCESS BY THE CHIP AND THEN IT WILL GENERATE SOME INFORMATION TO THE MAIN DEVICE
IT'S GENERALLY IN THE FORM OF INFRARED OR
SOME KIND OF S SENSOR INFORMATION
THEN WE WILL HAVE THE MAIN CONTROL IN THE MAIN DEVICE TO DO THE PARTICULAR ACTION WHAT WE WANT
SO BASICALLY WE NEED UH SINCE WE ARE FOCUSING ON OUR INTERFACE DEVICE REMOTE CONTROL WE NEED FEW COMPONENTS
MAINLY THE ENERGY SOURCE LIKE THE BATTERY AND THEN WE HAVE USER INTERFACE LIKE UH THE KEYPAD AND YOU KNOW BUTTONS WE WANT
AND THEN WE HAVE SOME CHIP
IT'S MAINLY DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CHIP BECAUSE SINCE WE ARE I AM ONE DOING MOSTLY DIGITAL UH DEVICES WE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PROCESSOR WHICH TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE FUNCTIONS AND PUT IT IN SOME DIGITAL FORMAT
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THE INFRARED L. E. D. SOURCE WHICH SENDS THE INFORMATION TO THE MAIN DEVICE
THEN WE'LL HAVE SWITCH IN OUR MAIN UH UM DEVICE TO DO PARTICULAR OPERATIONS AND WE OUGHT TO DO DIFFERENT CODES FOR DIFFERENT T. V. S
SO SOME T. V. S WILL HAVE DIFFERENT ENCRYPTION CODES FOR DOING S S UH CHANNEL CHANGING AND THESE THINGS
YEAH YEAH BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DON'T USE ONE PARTICULAR BRAND SO OR AT LEAST WE HAVE MORE MORE THAN FIVE BRANDS WHICH ARE REALLY GOOD
SO WE NEED TO CHECK THEIR SPECIFICATIONS AND DO THEIR UH ENCRYPTION THAT'S PASSING INFORMATION TO THE T. V. DEVICE
SO WE NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR ENCRYPTION CODES
THEN COMPONENTS
SO WE HAVE THE MAIN UH ENERGY SOURCE AND THEN WE WILL HAVE SOME BUTTONS AND THEN WE WILL HAVE INFRARED UH SOURCE AND THEN WE HAVE SOME INSIDE SOME CHIP IN IN THE DEVICE
UH SINCE I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME SO I'LL INPUT THE CONNECTIONS TO ALL THIS COMPONENTS
AND SINCE I ALSO WANT TO KNOW FEEDBACK FROM OUR MARKETING EXPERT AND USER INTERFACE SO IF YOU WANT TO ADD SOME MORE COMPONENTS WE CAN INCORPORATE THEM
YEAH
YEAH I'M SURE BECAUSE SINCE OUR USER INTERFACE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND ALSO MARKETING EXPERT FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS REALLY HANDY
SO WE CAN HAVE ANOTHER LIKE UH S SIMPLE SPEECH RECOGNISER ON OUR D. S. B. CHIP
SINCE WE HAVE SOME KIND OF UH ENERGY THIS IS OUR
THIS NORMAL BATTERY SO THIS BATTERY
ONCE YOU S SWITCH ON IT WILL TAKE POWER AND WE CAN HAVE SOME SPEECH RECOGNITION AND IN OUR G GENERALLY SMALL DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CHIP SO THAT AND WE WILL PUT UH THE SMALL UH SIMPLE SPEECH RECOGNISER AND WE CAN ALSO TRAIN THE SPEECH RECOGNISER FOR PARTICULAR USER SO YOU JUST YEAH
SO THAT WE JUST USE SIMPLE RECOG NO BUT BUT
YEAH
NO EVEN IN YOU CAN FIND EVEN SIMPLE MOBILE DEVICE LIKE ANY MOBILE BRAND YOU CAN HAVE THESE VOICE DIALERS OR THESE THINGS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO
UH MAYBE WE CAN MAKE UH IT IN FIVE EUROS AND EVEN LESS THAN THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE UH MILLIONS AND IN BULK
SO WE CAN MAKE REALLY SIMP AND WE WANT TO MAKE REALLY SIMPLE DEVICE BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY VERY FEW WORDS LIKE LIKE POWER
SWITCH ON OR SOME LIKE THEN WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS UM
WE'LL HAVE VOLUME
AND THEN WE WILL HAVE S PARTICULAR CHANNEL SO USERS CAN LISTEN
YE
NO YEAH A USER CAN USE ANY KIND OF SENDER BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE THIS PROMPT VOLUME AND THEN YEAH VOLUME AND DECREASE OR INCREASE
SO WE TRY TO ONLY RECOGNISE THOSE WORDS AND AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY SAY USER TO SAY SAME WORDING THEN IT BECOME MORE MECHANICAL AND YEAH
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE CHANNEL THEY CAN SAY OKAY I WANT EIGHT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW LIKE USERS HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMMES
I MEAN THEY DON'T REALLY FOLLOW SAME CHANNELS STRICT UH SO WE JUST WANT CHANNEL NUMBER WE DON'T WANT LIKE B. B. C. OR C. N. N. OR SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE
IT WILL BE COMPLICATED SO WE'LL HAVE ONLY THESE THREE UH MAIN BASIC UH ANYWAY VOLUME IS NOT REALLY SPEECH RECOGNITION PROBLEM
IT'S IT IT WILL BE TAKE CARE OF OUR MAIN MM
YEAH ACTUALLY WE WE CAN HAVE ONE SWITCH TO LIKE UH SWITCH ON ON AND OFF THIS PROCESSOR AND
THIS REALLY SUPPOSE LIKE HERE WE HAVE OUR MAIN CHIP WHICH CONTROLS POWER VOLUME AND THIS PART AND THIS D. S. P. S
AGAIN THIS TO HAVE SOME INTERACTION LIKE SUPPOSE PEOPLE USE D. S. P. THEN IT PARTICULARLY SENDS SOME INFORMATION TO THE CHIP LIKE IN SOME FORM
LIKE VOLUME AND LIKE THIS KEY
SO IT MAY NOT BE LIKE VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE SINCE WE ARE ONLY FOCUSING ON T. V. REMOTE CONTROL SO AND WE HAVE ONLY FEW THINGS HERE
YEAH
UM UH UH THIS POINT WE DIDN'T CONSIDER BECAUSE IT'S IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE V OUR TARGET IS ONLY LIKE TWELVE POINT FIVE EUROS AND
YEAH EVEN AUTOMATIC ON OFF IS ALSO A BIT PROBLEMATIC
BECAUSE IT DIFFERENT CRITERIA FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE LIKE SO SUPPOSE PEOPLE ARE REALLY UH THEY JUST UH THEY DON'T TOUCH THE REMOTE AND MM Y YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU NEED TO SWITCH ON OR SWITCH OFF AND
YAY YEAH
YEAH THAT CAN BE POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY FOR POWER SETTINGS SO USER CAN SAY OKAY
SUPPOSE THEY'RE WATCHING A TENNIS MATCH OR SOMETHING THEN THEY CAN SAY OKAY UH AFTER ONE HOUR I
THEY CAN MAKE
YEAH WE CAN HAVE
YEAH
UH NOT VERY MUCH LIKE YEAH
THANK YOU
YEP
THANK YOU
CAN YOU JUST YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MARK WILL
UH IT'S IN CURRENT PRICE YEAH
YEAH
BUT SPEECH RECOGNISER CAN BE POSSIBLE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH ESPECIALLY THE POWER IT REALLY CONSUMES BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE ALL THE TIME ON AND
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT'S GOOD
BUT IT'S A GOOD FEATURE I GUESS YEAH WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MORE HOW TO INCORPORATE IT
OH
AH IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO
OF COURSE
NICE STUFF
WHO STARTS
OH
HA
OKAY
SO I DUNNO IF I CAN DO THAT LIKE THIS
YEAH
SO IT'S BEING MODIFIED
DO YOU WANT YEAH OPEN
READ ONLY
I HOPE I SAVED IT
SO UM YEAH THIS IS MY NAME
SO AS YOU KNOW YOU I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW ME SAMMY BENJO
I AM THE EXPERT IN MARKETING AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE UH S WANT AND UH LIKE AND DISLIKE IN REMOTE CONTROLS
AND I HOPE THIS IS GOING TO HELP YOU TO TO DESIGN IT CORRECTLY
SO NEXT PLEASE
UH OH
HMM
YEAH MAYBE IN THE FULL PAGE BECAUSE I I SPENT LOTS OF TIME DOING THIS PRESENTATION SO
UH-HUH HMM OKAY
SO BASICALLY UH WHAT I SUGGEST IS THAT UH INSTEAD OF DECIDING OURSELF WHAT WHAT COULD BE AND WHAT SHOULD BE A GOOD UH REMOTE CONTROL
LET'S ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE USERS OF REMOTE CONTROLS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT W THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS WHAT THEY LIKE
WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE AND UM AND WHAT THEY DO WITH THEM BY THE WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USEFUL
DON'T FORGET ABOUT THAT
SO WE'VE WE'VE CONDUCTED A A SURVEY ON ON THE USE OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE RESULTS WE FOUND ON THIS SURVEY
AND NEXT PLEASE
YEAH SO BASICALLY WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT UH THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT THE USER DON'T LIKE IN REMOTE CONTROLS
FIRST OF ALL THEY FIND IT VERY UGLY
CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS AS YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE SAME AS THIS ONE UH THEY'RE NOT NICE COLOUR
NOT NICE SHAPE I MEAN THEY'RE ALL THE SAME AND THEY'RE NOT L GOOD LOOKING
UM WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT IN FACT IT SEEMS THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE ARE READY TO PAY FOR NICE AND LOOK AND FANCY LOOKING UH REMOTE CONTROL
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY SPEND LOTS OF TIME IN AND EFFORT IN THAT UM
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT UH THE THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE NOT SO EASY TO USE AND IT IT THE THE CURRENT UH FACILITIES THAT THEY OFFER DO NOT MATCH WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO USE THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS
FOR INSTANCE UH WE SEE THAT UH THEY ZAP VERY OFTEN SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY UH IMPORTANT UH FUNCTIONALITY THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY FOR THEM TO TO ZAP UH IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
AND MOST OF THE BUTTONS UH ON UH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE NOT USED
SO I THINK WE SHOULD DESIGN SOMETHING WHERE SOME OF THE BUTTONS WHICH ARE THOSE THAT ARE USED SHOULD BE EASIER TO SEE AND USE THAN OTHERS THAT ONLY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE ARE USING
UM NEXT PLEASE
NOW PEOPLE ARE VERY FRUSTRATED W WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS AND THEY FOR INSTANCE UH THEY DON'T EVEN FIND IT IT'S IT'S OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE IN THE IN YOUR HOME AND NOBODY KNOWS WHERE IT IS
MAYBE IF WE HAVE SOMETHING WHERE WE COULD ASK THE REMOTE CONTROL PLEASE WHERE ARE YOU
LIKE UH SOMETHING TO TO LIKE T I THINK PHONES
SOME OF THE PHONES HAVE SOME OF THIS KIND OF S FUNCTIONALITY
UH OF COURSE PHONE YOU CAN ALWAYS PHONE YOUR PHONE BUT YOU CAN'T PHONE YOUR YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
BUT WHY NOT
YEAH
AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY BUTTONS IN THESE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT NOBODY USE IN FACT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE THEM
SO MOST OF THE THE PEOPLE SAY THEY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO THEY TO USE PROPERLY THEIR R REMOTE CONTROLS
AND UH THEY ARE BAD FOR R. S. I. BUT UH I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IS R. S. I.
SO I THINK THEY ARE BAD
MM-HMM
MM NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA ABOUT THAT
WELL I'LL CHECK UH WITH MY
OH OKAY I THINK IT'S A TECHNICAL THING WHICH OUR
OKAY
SO IT SEEMS THAT IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR A CONCEPT THAT WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT
SO ANYWAY THAT'S FOR WHAT THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION UH OF THE USER AND UM
WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE
NEXT SLIDE
AH YEAH
SO WE'VE LISTED A COUPLE OF UH
S UH FUNCTIONS THAT MAY BE UH USED BY U THE USER IN THE CURRENT UH AVAILABLE UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND UH WELL THE TABLES LOOK VERY NICE TO READ BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE POWER BUTTON IS NOT USED OFTEN BECAUSE IN GENERAL YOU USE IT ONLY ONCE PER SESSION
BUT IT IS VERY RELEVANT
PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE A POWER BUTTON
CHANNEL SELECTION IS UH O OFTEN USED VERY OFTEN USED AND INDEED UH VERY RELEVANT
AH NOW I REMEMBER WHAT IS R. S. I. IT'S REPETITIVITY STRESS INJURY
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THAT WORD BUT UH ANYWAY I CONTINUE MY PRESENTATION SO YEAH CHANNEL SELECTION IS UM VERY IMPORTANT VERY OFTEN USED
VOLUME IS NOT OFTEN USED BUT PEOPLE UH WANT TO HAVE CONTROL ON VOLUME AND THAT MAKES SENSE OF COURSE
AND N THEN YOU HAVE THINGS WHICH ARE VERY MUCH LESS OFTEN USED LIKE THE SETTINGS
AUDIO SETTINGS SCREEN SETTINGS EVEN TELETEXT AND CHANNEL SETTINGS
ALL OF THEM
THEY'RE NOT OFTEN USED AND THEY ARE S MORE OR LESS RELEVANT
IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE FIND TELETEXT TELETEXT UH RELEVANT EVEN IF I PERSONALLY NEVER USE IT BUT SEEMS THAT IT'S AVERAGE RELEVANT AT LEAST SO
I CAN TELL YOU THAT UH IN A L IN A SCALE BETWEEN ONE AND TEN RELEVANT UH NOT RELEVANT TO RELEVANT PEOPLE SCORED A SIX ON THIS
WHICH IS NOT AS UH THESE THESE TWO ONE WERE HAD I THINK TEN I THINK
BUT BUT IF YOU COMPARE WITH THESE ONES UH I THINK THEY SCORED A ONE OR TWO
NOT VERY RELEVANT SO
IF IF THERE ARE GOOD REASON NOT TO PUT TELETEXT IT'S OKAY BUT JUST KNOW THAT PEOPLE FIND IT SOMEHOW RELEVANT
THAT'S FOR THE MAIN FUNCTIONS I THINK AND UH THEN WE CAN ASK UH OURSELF UH WHAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT MAY BE USEFUL
FOR INSTANCE I THINK NET NEXT SLIDE
ONE OF THE THING THE TREND UH THAT UH YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE OF IS THE POSSIBILITY THE EVENTUAL POSSIBILITY OF HAVING SPEECH RECOGNITION IN YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO TAP TAP IN YOUR BUTTONS BUT JUST TELL YOUR REMOTE CONTROL OR WHATEVER YOU NEED YOU HAVE WHAT YOU WANT
SO WE'VE CONDUCTED A SURVEY ABOUT UH WHETHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE OR NOT TO HAVE UH THIS KIND OF UH FUNCTIONALITY IN THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND AS WE CAN SEE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE AGE
YOUNG PEOPLE PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S A BUZZ WORD FIND IT VERY RELEVANT
AND UH AS THE AGE GOES UP THE THE RELEVANCE GOES DOWN
SO NOW IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF UH TARGETING UH WHA WHO ARE WE TARGETING WITH THIS REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK IF WE ARE TARGETING YOUNG PEOPLE THEN UH IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
IF WE ARE TARGETING YOU VERY OLD PEOPLE THIS IS SOMETHING THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY THEY THIS SHOULD BE SO NOW THIS IS OF COURSE DEPENDS ON THAT
AND UM I DON'T HAVE ANY CONCLUSION I DIDN'T HAVE TIME THE MEETING WAS VERY TIGHT SO THAT'S BASICALLY MY FINDINGS
AND UH IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION
I CAN GO BACK
YEAH ONE QUESTION YEAH
I AM
I THINK WE SHOULD AIM AT THE YOUNG PEOPLE
BUT UH I THINK THEY ARE THEY ARE THOSE UH WHO MIGHT BE MORE INTERESTED IN A IN A NEW DEVICE
IN GENERAL THE THE EARLY ADOPTERS OF A NEW DEVICE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE LESS THAN MORE THAN
THEN TELETEXT IS USELESS FOR THEM I THINK YEAH
BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE OTHER MEANS OF FINDING THEIR INFORMATION
YEAH
BUT YEAH
NOPE
'KAY
SO I THINK IT'S YOU HUH
NO
NO USER REQUIREMEN
MAKES SENSE
I WOULD SAY THE SIMPLEST ONE AS LONG AS THERE ARE THE UH I FIND THE BUTTONS THAT I NEED EVERY TIME I NEED A BUTTON
NICE
NICE SENTENCE
MM
MM-HMM
HMM
AND WHEN DOES IT TURN OFF
OH SO YOU HAVE A
SENSING SENSOR MACHINE THAT UH KNOWS
TECH
MM-HMM
ACCORDING TO YOUR DISTANCE TO AND THE ANGLE MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A STEREO SYSTEM
UH I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE SCREEN WHA WHAT IS THE USE USEFULNESS OF THE SCREEN
UH IS IT A TOUCH SCREEN BY THE WAY
SO IT GIVES INSTRUCTIONS BUT UH IT HAS TO BE WITH AN BACK LIGHT SOMEHOW
OKAY
OKAY
SO FOR INSTANCE IF I WANT TO GO TO DIRECTLY TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE HOW WOULD I DO CAN I DO THAT WITH THIS
YEAH MM LET'S SAY I AM UH ON CHANNEL EIGHT NOW
YOU KNOW THESE DAYS WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS THAT'S NOT SO EASY TO GO JUST NEXT NEXT NEXT WHEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS
OR IS IT
MOST PEOPLE YEAH
IN FACT IN IN ONE UH REMOTE CONTROL THAT I'VE SEEN INSTEAD OF DOING THAT D YOU COULD JUST SAY THESE ARE THE CHA CH CHANNEL THREE
TWENTY EIGHT FORTY EIGHT AND UH SIXTY FOUR ARE THOSE THAT I WANT TO BY CYCLED WITH MY NEXT BUTTON
I UH
B YEAH
GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE
ONE THING IS THAT AS I SAID IN MY PRESENTATION PEOPLE REALLY DO LIKE TO Z ZAP
SO EVEN IF THEY ARE ONLY WATCHING FOUR OR FIVE CHANNELS
I THINK THEY WANT TO ZAP OUT OF THE ONE HUNDRED CHANNELS JUST BECAUSE THIS IS ONE KIND OF THING THEY DO ZAPPING
AND IT'S ONLY NEXT
YEAH SO BUT YOU HAVE TO
OKAY
SO IT WOULD BE
OKAY
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
LISTENING MORE
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL I COULD COULD UH HAVE A LOOK AT THAT MAYBE
I'LL CHECK IN MY DEPARTMENT IF THERE'S SOMEONE SPECIALIST IN THAT
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT UH VERY VERY GOOD TO SELL
THINK OF A ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOVE TO SAY THAT THIS REMOTE CONTROL ONLY WORKS FOR THEM
AND HA HA YOU CANNOT USE MY REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S TARGETED TO ME
WHATEVER
HMM
CHEAP
MILLIONS
CHEAP
THE USER UH WILL JUST BE ABLE TO SAY UH PLEASE CAN YOU UH PUMP UP THE VO PUMP UP THE VOLUME OR OR IT WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE VOLUME
UP DOWN
OKAY
OKAY
COUPLE OF WORDS
OKAY
OF COURSE UH IT HAS TO BE
OKAY
BUT THEN I THINK YOU
YOU
FIRST OF ALL I I THINK THIS IS NOT UH FUNCTIONALITY THAT IT IS GOING TO BE INSTEAD OF USING THE BUTTONS
IT'S ON TOP OF USING THE BUTTON
WELL I DUNNO
T. V.
VERY EXPENSIVE NO
AND VOLUME CONTROL
SO BUT UH
SH SHOULD WE TARGET A A USER PERSONALISED UH UH REMOTE CONTROL
SO IN IN A GIVEN ROOM THERE MIGHT BE MORE THAN ONE REMOTE CONTROL
WE WOULD UH HAVE EACH ONE AND UH WITH OUR OWN PERSONAL UH SETTINGS
HMM
YEAH OF COURSE
THAT'S NO PROBLEM WE WILL SELL MORE
YEAH EXACTLY
OKAY
THANKS
MM GREAT
DIFFICULT
MM-HMM
NO
SPEAKERS IN THE REMOTE CONT
OH YEAH
IT JUST BEEPS
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH
SOMETHING VERY CHEAP
BUT THAT'S EX THAT'S EXPENSIVE
UH
WELL I I HEARD OF DEVICES WHERE YOU JUST UH WHISTLE THEM AND AND THEY BECAUSE OF THE THE FREQUENCY THEY THEY JUST ANSWER TO THAT
YOU CAN'T WHISTLE
UH-HUH
OR A CLAP
YOU CAN CLAP
CAN YOU
CLAP IS GOOD
TAK
JUST A SUGGESTION
WITH ONLY ONE HAND
THESE ARE NOT OUR TARGET PEOPLE
MM-HMM
OH THAT'S E THAT ALREADY EXISTS OKAY OKAY
OH YEAH YOU DO HAVE
WOW
YOU'RE TRENDY
THINK ABOUT IT
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
GOOD WE'RE DONE
RIGHT THANKS
OKAY SO NOW WE ARE ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
UH Y GETTING CLOSE TO THE LAST IS THE PENULTIM MEETING
MM GREAT
SO UM I WILL AGAIN DO THE SECRETARY PART UH WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTATION FIRST UM UH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN FIRST RAMA THEN MARK AND THEN SAMMY
UM UM WE HAVE TO TAKE A DECISION ON THE CONTROL REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS AND WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES
SO WHAT WE WANT TO THE DECISION WE WANT TO TAKE ON THIS MEETING ARE ON THE UM FIRST ON THE COMPONENT CONCEPT
SO WHAT KIND OF ENERGY WE USE UH WHAT KIND OF CHIP ON PRINT AND ONE KI KIND OF CASE
AND ALSO ON USER INTERFACE CONCEPT UH WHAT KIND OF INTERFACE WE USE AND IF THERE IS SOME SUPPLEMENTS
AND AT THE END UM SAMMY WILL GIVE UM A TREND WATCHING ON WHAT HE'S HE'S BEEN DOING
IT'S
SO LET'S GO
FIRST
WITH RAMA
PARTICIPANT TWO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM OKAY
UM I WANT TO KNOW WHY IT B UH JUST UH SORRY BUT FOR THE POINT BEFORE UH WHY NOT THE RUBBER
IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IT SEEMS TO BE LIGHT
OKAY
YOU M TITANIUM IT'S MORE UH
YES SO MM
UH-HUH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
UH YEAH SO
OKAY S SO SIMPLE BUTTON AND UH SPEECH RECOGNITION FOR THE MORE COMPLICATED
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM
OKAY FOR THE LOCATION
HMM
OKAY
SO LET'S NOW GO TO THE YOU DON'T HAVE MORE QUESTION
UM MM THANK YOU MM
YEAH
YEAH BUT MM
OKAY
UM YEAH
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT UH INTERFACE
THREE
WHICH ONE
OKAY
MM
NO
MM-HMM
'KAY
MM-HMM
BECAUSE APPARENTLY FROM YOUR SURVEY PEOPLE LIKE COLOURS NO
OKAY
SO
UH-HUH OKAY SO YOU YOU PROPOSE SOMETHING WITH OPTION I THAT INCREASE THE PRICE IF WE IF YOU WANT O MORE COLOURS ON L. C. D. YEAH
OKAY
AND THERMODYNAMIC ALSO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT THAT'S MAYBE MO TOO MUCH EXPENSIVE YEAH
BUT UH IT CAN BE IN UH MAYBE IN AN A GRADABLE VERSION BUT
MM-HMM
OKAY AND YOU THINK THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE TO MAKE THEM PAY MORE BECAUSE OF UH O OR THIS IS
OKAY SO
SO I IT'S NOT UH A S BASE SERVICE IT'S A
MM
OKAY
MM-HMM
SO M SO MAYBE THAT'S IF THAT IT'S A SELLING POINT MAYBE IT HAS TO BE THE BASE
AND YOU'LL BE DIFFERENT
UH IN THE TRAIN UH HELLO UH NO
WANT TO CHANGE MY NEIGHBOUR
MM
MM-HMM
IRADIUM
AH SORRY
MM
OKAY
SO MM
MM-HMM
MM THAT'S A NICE WORLD
OKAY
MM
OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO IT'S YEAH MARKETING EXPERT
PARTICIPANT TWO
FOUR SORRY
MM
MM-HMM
S
SO MAYBE TITANIUM IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA
MM-HMM
UM SORRY MARK
IT SEEMS TO BE
MM MM
MM-HMM
HMM
YOU'RE OLD FASHIONED
SORRY
OKAY
MM YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
NO MORE QUESTION
OKAY
SO
MM-HMM
OKAY SO WE WILL HAVE UH NEXT MEETING IN THIRTY MINUTES AGAIN
UM NOW YOU HAVE TO GO STRAIGHT ON THIS INDIVIDUAL ACTION WHICH I WHICH ARE FOR RAMA UH WIL DESIGN
UM MARK THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND UH SAMMY UH THE PRODUCT EVALUATION
UH YOU WILL WORK TOGETHER UH ON A NEW ON ON A PROTOTYPE USING MODELLING CLAY
MM-HMM UM
AND I AS ALWAYS YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL SEND YOU SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT YOU HAVE TO
SO YOU SAY S
S DO WE AGREE ON THAT
YEAH
WE HAVE TO
NO
OKAY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
SO TITANIUM SMELL LIKE FRUIT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
I I AGREE WITH UH THIS UH
NOW WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHAT KIND OF FANCINESS
DO WE TAKE TITANIUM SMELLING LIKE FRUIT OR DO WE MAKE SPONGY
UH FRUITY LIKE
MM
YEAH YEAH
DON'T YOU SAY THAT YOU CANNOT DO DOUBLE SHAPE UH CURVED SHAPE YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM MM
OKAY SO YOU EXPLORE NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER THESE THESE TWO
OR OR SPONGY AN YEAH
MM
MM
YEAH I DON'T THINK W I THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE
IF WE CHOOSE UH TITANIUM OR IF WE CHOOSE SPONGY BUT UH IT CANNOT BE BOTH
AH YOU CAN PRETEND THAT IT'S UH TITANIUM
YEAH DO DON'T WORRY YOU YOU YOU SPEAK WITH MM MM
OKAY
SO EXPLORE A SHAPE
MM I THINK IT'S WHAT WE SAY THAT WE HAVE AN UH AN L. C. D. WITH UH INFORMATION
NOT UH
MM-HMM
MM
MM
OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
SO ARE WE MM
OKAY
SO SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
HOW WAS LUNCH
MM
WHY
MM-HMM
W WE CAN USE SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BODY'S TITANIUM BUT THERE ARE SOME RUBBER OR I DUNNO SOME RUBBER PARTS LIKE TO MAKE IT FEEL BETTER AND TO YOU KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY AND STILL WE HAVE MM CAN WE STILL INCLUDE THE L. L. S. D. DISPLAY
L. C. D. YEAH L. C. D.
NO IT'S NOT GONNA BE A T NO TOUCHABLE BUT STILL LIKE A SOURCE OF INFORMATION OR SOURCE FOR MENUS
OKAY SO LET'S TRY IT LET'S T
YEAH YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT GONNA BE A TOUCH PAD UH JUST A DISPLAY FOR GIVING YOU INFORMATION
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO MORE QUESTIONS
MM YEAH YEAH
BUT STILL UH L. S. D. 'S ALREADY QUITE NICE L. C. I'M AN ARTIST SORRY
SO UH THAT'S NOT I HOPE THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH
OKAY
UH PARTICIPANT NUMBER THREE
UH
MM
MM UH HAVE A LOOK AT THIS NO IT'S YEAH
UH SO THE CONCEPT OF THE INTERFACE
GENERALLY I DEVELOPED QUITE A BROAD CONCEPT NOT ONLY FOR THE INTERFACE BUT FOR
POSSIBLE INSTRUCTION OR USER'S MANUAL AND UH ALL THE COMPLEX THINGS THAT COME TOGETHER WITH YOUR T. V. AND REMOTE CONTROLS
SO LET'S START WITH THIS
WE GOT OUR PERFECT REMOTE CONTROL WITH A LOT OF BUTTONS AND UH WE GOT EXPLANATION FOR EVERY BUTTON AND YOU CAN USE YOUR TIME AND UH IT WILL TAKE I SOME DAYS TO LEARN ALL THIS BUTTONS AND UM THE L. C. D. IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE HERE
AND UH GO BACK BUTTON I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHERE IT IS MAYBE ONE OF THIS BUTTONS
AND UM POWER ON AND OFF MM I I DON'T REMEMBER SO UH IT IT IT SHOULD BE MAYBE THIS BUTTON IS POWER ON AND OFF
OR NO
I CAN SEE NOTHING
SO THAT'S OUR CONCEPT
IT'S CALLED THE MILLENNIUM REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
REALLY
I THOUGHT YOU LIKE IT
AH OKAY JUST PRESS THE BUTTON PLEASE UH
YEAH WE WILL NOT USE THIS
WE WILL NOT USE THIS
BUT INSTEAD OF THIS I WILL DEVISE THAT'S OUR CONCEPT
AND IT'S GOT JUST FEW BUTTONS QUITE LOW LOOKING AND ALL THIS STUFF WE ALREADY
WE ALREADY DISCUSSED
AND UH WHAT WILL PEOPLE SAY
THEY'LL SAY IT'S PERFECT
OR WHAT WILL SAY
UH THEY WILL SAY IT'S SPLENDID
AND UH E EVERYONE WILL SAY I'LL BUY IT
AND EVERYONE'S GONNA BE SATISFIED
I WOULD MAKE A BACKLIGHT OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS
NOT THE CASE
YEAH
OKAY SO LET'S REMEMBER THERE'S A NOKIA PHONE WHICH CHANGEABLE PANELS
DO YOU LIKE IT
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T HAVE IT
THAT'S WHY 'CAUSE IT'S NASTY
NO
UM I AM HERE
MM-HMM
'KAY
OKAY WHAT UH THERE'S ONE MORE DECISI UH ONE MORE SOLUTION IN FACT
UM 'CAUSE THERE ARE SOME SOME PAINTS THAT CAN CHANGE COLOUR ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE LIKE THEY CAN REFLECT DIFFERENT COLOURS
DEPENDING ON WHAT IS AROUND LIKE WHAT COLOUR IS AROUND AND DEPENDING ON THE TEMPERATURE YEAH
WE CAN MAKE IT IN FACT
IF IF IF THE OKAY
MM-HMM MM-HMM SO
UH-HUH
SO BE AN OPTION YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT YOU JUST TAKE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH YOU ALL THE TIME
AND IT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT YOU KNOW
ANYONE HAS THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS HERE
NO
MM-HMM
OKAY
UH-HUH UH-HUH
COULD WE INTEGRATE SOMETHING INTO OUR REMOTE CONTROL SOMETHING LIKE LIGHT
THAT THEY CAN USE IT IN DARKNESS LIKE
HAND LIGHT YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
S WELL LET'S GO ON MAYBE WITH THE PRESENTATION
AND UM THE REMOTE CONTROL'S GOING TO BE SMART BUT HOW SMART SHOULD IT BE TO NOT TO COMPLICATE THINGS TOO MUCH
AND UH
I DUNNO THAT'S A QUESTION TO YOU AND TO MM TO
MM-HMM
OKAY OKAY
SO JUST JUST JUST JUST THINK ABOUT IT UM
THANK YOU
UH YEAH I JUST WANT TO SAY IT SHOULD BE REAL SMART
VOICE RECOGNITION IS QUITE TOUGH
I SAY DON'T USE IT AND THE CONTROL JUST LOOKS
'CAUSE I ORDERED JUS
TO L TO L LOCK IT
YEAH SURE
MM-HMM
OKAY THANKS
WHAT IS SPONGY
OKAY
OKAY
SO WE HAVE TO UH FOR
YEAH SO ARE WE CONFIDENT ENOUGH ON CREATING TRENDS
WELL WE CAN MAKE IT SMELL LIKE FRUIT
YEAH
MM-HMM MM-HMM
COULD WE MAKE A TITANIUM SHAPE
I MEAN FRUIT SHAPED
BUT
DOUB DOUBLE CURVED
OKAY OKAY
IN FACT I JUST AGREED TO MAKE UH
TO MAKE THE LIKE TITANIUM PANELS
ON A WHOLE
RUBBER BODY
WELL OKAY W WE'LL SEE
YEAH
WE'LL SEE
WE'LL SEE
WE'LL SEE
I I REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS MODELLING CLAY 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT MAKES SOME FOR FOR I DUNNO UH YEAH UM WE'LL LOOK
OKAY OKAY
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
RAMARO
YEAH PARTICIPANT TWO
COMPONENT
YEP
SO WE'RE TO MAINLY DESIGN F MAINLY NEED TO KNOW WHICH COMPONENTS WE'LL USE FOR ENERGY AND THE MATERIAL AND INTERFACE
FOR ENERGY THERE ARE MAYBE TWO OR THREE POSSIBILITIES
FIRST ONE WE CAN USE SIMPLE BATTERY OR WE CAN USE TRADITIONAL SOLAR CELLS OR MM AND THE MATERIAL WE CAN HAVE PLASTIC
RUBBER WHICH IS GOOD FOR THIS R. S. A. AND THEN UH TITANIUM
WHICH CAN BE WHICH HAVE VERY GOOD LOOK AN AND THEN INTERFACE WE'RE TO USE PUSH BUTTONS OR LIQUID CRYSTAL D L. C. D. DISPLAY
AND WE CAN USE SOME MOVING KIND OF THING
SO AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE WE NEED TO WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME SPEECH RECOGNITION S CHIP IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL
SO THIS CAN BE SIMPLE KIND OF PROGRAMMABLE CHIP AND WHICH CAN USE MICROPHONE SENSORS
AND WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT OUR REMOTE CONTROL SO
STILL WE ARE LOOKING FOR POSSIBLE UH TECHNICAL UH SPECIFICATIONS AND HOW W EASY WE CAN DO AND WITHIN OUR PRI RANGE
LIKE WE'RE TO IN OUR TWELVE EUROS OR AROUND THAT
SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR SIMPLE DEVICES OR SIMPLE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THE LOCATION OF REMOTE CONTROL IN A ROOM OR IN A HOUSE
SO UH WE DISCUSSED AN
EXCUSE ME
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE BATTERY INSTEAD OF SOLAR CELLS AND IT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC UH TO HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY WITH THE SOLAR CELLS AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO JUST USE SIMPLE BATTERY
AND ALSO WE WANT TO GO FOR TITANIUM DESIGN INSTEAD OF RUBBER OR AND WELL THE PROBLEM IS WITH THIS DESIGN WE FOUND THAT WE CAN'T USE DOUBLE CURVED SHAPES
LIKE YOU CAN HAVE TWO CURVES
UH IT'S I THINK IN MANUFACTURING I GUESS IT'S PROBLEMATIC
SO
WE WANT TO GO FOR SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS BECAUSE IT NEED A SIMPLE CHIP AND IT'S REALLY LESSER UH RE REALLY LESS EXPENSIVE COMPARED TO L. C. D. WHICH ARE UH WHICH NEEDS ADVANCED CHIP TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
SINCE WE WANT TO PUT SOME OTHER FEATURES SUCH AS SPEECH RECOGNITION WE WANT TO REDUCE UH COST
UH
UH
AND ALSO LIKE IN IF YOU PUT A IT'S BE DIFFICULT TO DO ALL THE MOULDING OF BUTTONS AND THESE THINGS AND
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE IN CELL PHONES RECENTLY THESE YOU CAN WITH THE RUBBER IN FOUR DIRECTIONS AND YEAH
BUT FULL ASSEMBLY
WE'LL USE MAINLY FOR TITANIUM RUBBER IS EXPENSIVE AND ALSO IT'S BIT DIFFICULT TO DO ALL THE SHAPES UH
AND THIS PUSH BUTTONS WE WE WOULD LIKE TO USE PUSH BUTTONS INSTEAD OF L. C. D. S AND SO WE WANT TO MO I MEAN WE'RE WE WANT TO PUT SPEECH RECOGNITION SO WE WANT TO REDUCE PRICE ON THIS TECHNOLOGY AND SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH SPACE OR ENOUGH MONEY FOR
S S
Y YEAH WE HAVE SIMPLE BUTTONS AND SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SO
UH L
SO UH IT'S LIKE A
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN SEE DEPENDING ON HOW WE'LL COME UP WITH OUR FULL DESIGN THEN IF WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY OR LIKE FOR AND BECAUSE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WILL TAKE AT LEAST FIVE EUROS OR OR SOMETHING SO WE WANT TO REDUCE THE COST ON DISPLAY OR THIS INTER
OK
YEAH THAT CAN WE WE CAN CONSIDER BECAUSE LIKE IT WON'T TAKE MUCH MONEY I GUESS BECAUSE
OKAY YEP
YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR
YEAH
YEAH WE'RE TO GO FOR LI AND NOW I THINK WE HAVE MANY OPTIONS IN THE MARKET SO WE CAN GO FOR SMALL NICKEL OR ALKALINE BATTERIES FOR
REALLY LIGHT BATTERIES AND WITH UH GOOD PRICE
YEAH
THAT'S THEN THE THE ONE THING WE WANT TO KNOW IS LIKE BECAUSE REMOTE CONTROL IS USED FOR LIKE IN THE HOUSEHOLD SO IT IT IT WILL BE IT M MAYBE AT LEAST FIVE
SIX PEOPLE WANT TO USE IT SO SO HOW TO UH UH HOW TO DEFINE OUR RE SPEECH RECOGNITION WHETHER WE WANT TO DO S SPEAKER INDEPENDENT OR SPEAKER DEPENDENT
IF WE'RE GOING FOR MORE SPEAKER INDEPENDENT THEN IT WOULD BE LIKE AGAIN CUMBERSOME AND WE NEED REALLY M MORE TECHNOLOGY AND SO
YEAH IF IF EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE N TO LOCATE THEN WE'RE TO GO FOR SOME SPEAKER INDEPENDENT TECHNOLOGY OR SOMETHING
YEP
THANK YOU
YEAH
OH
WE HAVE UH SOME LIMITATIONS
THREE
SO MAYBE YOU CAN USE IN THE END AND
UH
MM
YEAH
BUT IT'S UH
BUT IT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE NO
IF YOU USE COLOUR L. C. D.
UH INSTEAD OF THAT MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR OF THE ASSEMBLER
MAYBE WE CAN JUST IF USERS WANT MORE COLOURS THEY CAN PAY MORE MONEY TO GET THIS
UH THE SHAPES AND THEY CAN HAVE DIFFERENT ASSEMBLY
SO USERS HAVE DIFFERENT I MEAN THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INTERESTS COLOUR INTERESTS AND SO
SO WE CAN JUST IF THEY WANT THEY CAN JUST PAY ANOTHER
TWO EURO
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YES
IF THEY WANT LIKE UH SO THAT WE CAN YEAH
YEAH
JUST THEY'LL GET FEW MORE
THINGS AND FEW MORE COLOURS
LIGHTS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM
YEAH
UH
MM
BUT THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE REALLY FEW NO
SO LIKE WE CAN THOSE
AH
YEAH
MM
HMM
YEAH MAYBE LIKE THE INFRARED LIKE WE CAN PUT SOME
RADIUM CHIPS OR SOMETHING SO THAT LIKE AT LEAST UM YEAH
YEAH THAT
OH
YEAH
UH THAT MM THAT COULD BE FEASIBLE I GUESS LIKE
SO SINCE WE HAVE WE WANT TO DO SOME SPEAKER DEPENDENT SPEECH RECOGNITION UH SO WE CAN USE YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH IT'S
HMM
FOUR
MM
YEAH KIND OF UM MAYBE
YEAH IT
YEAH
YEAH
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MM MM
FRUIT
EVEN SHAPE
MORE YEAH
YEAH
MM
SO THESE ABILITIES ARE MAINLY AD ADDRESSED BY YOUNG PEOPLE
OR IT'S
THIS YOU YOU SO DID YOU
WHERE
OH
OH OKAY MM-HMM
IT'S NOT FROM MM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S MORE GENERAL TREND IT'S NOT PARTICULAR TO THE REMOTE CONTROL
MM
YEAH
YEAH BUT SOME MATERIALS N THEY'RE TO BE
UH THEY'RE TO BE SOMETHING LIKE SOLID LIKE THEY CAN'T BE REALLY SPONGY OR YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH SPONGE YEAH YEAH AT LEAST THAT'S
YEAH YEAH THAT YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH LOOKING YEAH FRUIT
THESE THINGS CAN BE EASILY INCORPORATED
WE CAN HAVE T COLOURS OR THIS SHAPE OR AT LEAST YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
LOOK AND FEEL DE
HMM
HMM
MM SOUNDS INTERESTING
SO CAN WE HIGHLIGHT THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF OUR YEAH
SO SO WE WANT THE SPEECH RECOGNISER AND WE WANT SOME KIND OF BUTTONS AND WE WANT SOME THEMES LIKE FRUITS OR VEGETABLES
THAT'S WE WANT TO FOLLOW GENERAL TREND
YEAH
SO DO YOU THINK
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S
SO WHAT ABOUT LOCATION AND THESE THINGS PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTING ON THOSE FEATURES
OR THEY REALLY LIKE
THEY MORE WANT THESE FANCY FEATURES LIKE
FEATURE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH WE WILL TRY TO EXPLORE THESE TWO OPTIONS AND YEAH YEAH
UH YEAH AT LEAST LIKE WE CAN MAKE BANANA OR
YEAH IT'S IT'S YEAH THAT'S A WE'RE TO LOOK FOR AND AND S WE'RE TO SEE THE WHETHER RUBBER IS EXPENSIVE AND D
HMM
MM
YEAH
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ASSEMBLY ALSO LIKE ONE SPONGY AND ONE KIND OF TITANIUM
WE HAVE ONLY THE PLASTIC OR THE THE CHIPPY YEAH FIBRE CHIPS OR
UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
EVEN DESIGN
SO STILL WE WANT TO KEEP L. C. D.
OR
OKAY
YEAH THEN WE CAN
YEAH YEAH THAT USER FRIENDLY OR
MM
YEAH
YEAH
AND WE JUST STICK WITH TWO BATTERIES SO IT'S NOT ANY SOLAR OR YEAH YEAH J YEAH BECAUSE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WE'RE DONE
YEP
MM-HMM
THANKS DON'T BE SARCASTIC
MARK
UH RAMA
AH
MM-HMM
WHAT IS A DOUBLE CURVED SHAPE
UH-HUH
THE COST
MM LIKE THIS
MM-HMM
SPEECH
L. C. D.
SEEMS NOT IT'S EITHER L. C. D. OR PUSH BUTTON
AH
THE L. C. D. WOULD
THE DISPLAY WOULD ONLY BE DISPLAY AND NOT UH TOUCH SENSITIVE YOU MEAN
JUST UH FOR OUTPUT YEAH
YEAH
I GUESS NO UM
SO THE BATTERIES UH ARE GOING TO BE VERY LIGHT
OKAY
SO THIS DEVICE ON N THAT CAN BE USED FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION COULD ALSO BE USED FOR JUST UH THE FINDING IT BASICALLY
INSTEAD OF CLAPPING WHY NOT JUST BE ASK
MM-HMM
OKAY
NO IT'S OKAY
PUTS LESS OF CONSTRAINT ON WHAT WE CAN DO BUT
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT
WE HAVE DREAMS AND THE IN THE END WE FIND OUT THAT IT'S NOT FEASIBLE
ANYWAY
YEAH
L. C. D.
L. S. D. IS SOMETHING ELSE AND IT'S QUITE NICE AS WELL
SO GO ON UH ARTIST
HMM
LET'S CHANGE MILLENNIUMS
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
THIS IS VERY UGLY
OH NO TOO MUCH CONCEPT
AH
AH BACK TODAY
DO YOU THINK IT CAN COME IN SEVERAL COLOURS
OR DID THE
UM BUT NOT THE CASE
UH THE CASE WOULD ONLY BE IN THAT UH ALUMINIUM UH TITANIUM STUFF LIKE
YEAH WELL THEY LIKE UH SOMETHING WHICH IS UH
MM YEAH OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE THE OPTION
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE A NOKIA PHONE BUT
I DON'T USE THAT BUT AGAIN UH I MIGHT
YEAH BU BUT
MM-HMM
KIND OF UPGRADABLE UH REMOTE CONTROL
WOW WOW
MM
LIKE A CHAMELEON
MM-HMM
BECAUSE UH I THINK THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE
THOSE FOR WHICH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH
IS TO BE UH SOMETHING USEFUL UH I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS LATER BUT AND THOSE FOR WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT UH IS UH SPECIFIC TO THEM SO IT IT'S LIKE A SIGNATURE
MY REMOTE CONTROL IS PINK
NOBODY ELSE THAN ME HAS A PINK REMOTE CONTROL
AND THAT MAKES ME SPECIAL
I THINK I THINK THEY WOULD BE READY P READY TO PAY MORE FOR THAT
THOSE WHO WANTED TO HAVE IT PINK
NO MM NO
IT MIGHT BE OPTIONAL YEAH
THE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THEIR FRIENDS
ALTHOUGH SIMILAR BUT HAVE SOMETHING JUST SLIGHTLY BETTER
PINK
MM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YOU ALWAYS HAVE YOUR REMOTE
OH YOU DON'T
YEAH
YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR REMO
WH YOU YOU KNOW LIKE FOR INSTANCE TAKE THE IPOD
IT'S A KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL
UH IT'S WHITE AND IT'S SO WHITE THAT YOU SEE IT FROM ANY ANYWHERE
IT HAS THIS DISTINCTIVE LOOK AND FEEL AND LOOK WHICH PEOPLE SEEMS TO LIKE JUST BECAUSE IT'S A COLOUR THAT WE DON'T USUALLY SEE IN A REMOTE CONTROL
WHITE
SEEMS IMPORTANT
MM GLOW IN THE DARK SO
OKAY
YEAH
UH-HUH YEAH SURE
WELL SO I HEARD THAT UH IT SEEMS THAT SPEECH RECOGNITION IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE UH SO THAT'S THE SMARTNESS OF THE THING
CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE GUNS WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION OR UH BEER CANS WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT WE MAY HAVE REMOTE CONTROLS WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION
I DUNNO
DON'T TOUCH THE REMOTE
BUT YEAH
ARE ARE YOU SAYING HERE THAT UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHO IS USING IT
SO FOR INSTANCE THE YOUNG GUY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE IT BECAUSE HIS FATHER DOESN'T WANT
LIKE WITH SOME
MAYBE FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION OR
MM
UM
MM
OKAY
SO IT COULD BE
SMART IN THAT WAY
BUT FOR INSTANCE TH I I'M THINKING ABOUT THE OTHER UH UH PARTICULARITY THAT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL COULD HAVE
S SINCE IT IT KNOWS WHO IS USING IT
IT MIGHT ALSO RECORD THE KIND OF UH CHANNELS YOU ARE U MORE OFTEN USING AND UH LEVELS OF VOLUMES THAT YOU'RE MORE OFTEN UH THINGS LIKE THAT AND PROVIDE YOU WAYS OF USING THEM
I DUNNO SOMEHOW I DUNNO THAT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE BUT
THAT MIGHT ALSO BE A GOOD SALES PITCH AGAIN
THE REMOTE THAT KNOWS YOU
MY TURN
OKAY IT'S ALRIGHT
FOUR I THINK
TREND YEAH
NO UH YES
OKAY SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TRENDS AND UM I HOPE THIS CAN HELP US TO TO UNDERSTAND L HOW WE SHOULD DESIGN OUR REMOTE CONTROL
SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
SO FIRST MAYBE JUST A SMALL RECAP ON HOW HOW DO WE WATCH TRENDS SO IT'S NOT SO UH SIMPLE YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IT'S EASY BUT UH IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE
ANYWAY THESE DAYS UH THE BEST UH SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS THE WEB AS YOU KNOW SO HAVE TO
TO GO OFTEN ON THE WEB AND LOOK AT UH WHAT THE OTHERS ARE DOING
AND ASK REAL PEOPLE WHO ARE USING REAL REMOTE CONTROLS EVERY DAY UH OR ANY OTHER TOOL THAT IS SIMILAR TO A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH BASICALLY IS A SMALL DEVICE THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH THEM
ALWAYS LIKE A PHONE
WE CAN WE CAN USE THE PHONE AS A AS A GOOD UH UH EXAMPLE OF WHERE TO IN BE INSPIRED
OF COURSE THOSE THA D WHO ARE WATCHING THE TRENDS ARE ALSO HAVE ALSO TO BE INSPIRED BECAUSE IN FACT THEY'RE NOT ONLY WATCHING THE TRENDS
THEY'RE INVENTING IT THEY'RE CREATING THE TREND
I HOPE I'M GOING TO TRY TO HELP YOU ON THAT
THIS IS MORE RISKY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE TREND YOU TRY TO INVENT IT
WHICH MEANS EITHER YOU SUCCEED AND YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OR YOU DON'T AND YOU'RE OUT OF BUSINESS
SO ANYWAY UH NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
UH TO BE TO BE QUICK THERE'S A LOT OF WORDS HERE BUT UH BASICALLY THERE ARE UH IN IN THE MARKET OF OF REMOTE CONTROLS THERE ARE THREE ASPECTS THAT WE SHOULD VERY PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO
THE FIRST ONE WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS THAT IT HAS TO BE FANCY IT HAS TO HAVE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
AND UH INTERESTINGLY THIS IS THE VERY MOST IMPORTANT THING
IT HAS TO BE FANCY
STRANGELY ENOUGH IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO BE FANCY THAN TO BE WI AND NOW THAT'S THE SECOND THING IT HAS TO BE IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY I INNOVATIVE
IT HAS TO BE NEW WITH SOME OF UH NEW UH TECHNOLOGY INSIDE AND UH AND THIS IS ALSO UH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LAST THING WHICH WE W MAY THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT
WHICH IS THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE AND IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE AS A REMOTE CONTROL
SO AS YOU SEE UH IT FIRST HAVE TO BE VERY NICE
S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF UH UH THAT I UH THEY CAN BE ID IDENTIFIED WITH UH AND AND THEN UH SOMETHING THAT UM CONTAINS VERY NOVEL STUFF THAT THEY CAN TALK ABOUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS
HUH MINE HAS THIS AND NOT YOURS
AND FINALLY OF COURSE IT HAS TO BE USEFUL AS A REMOTE CONTROL BUT IT SEEMS THAT IT'S NOT SO IMPORTANT THAT IT'S USEFUL AS A REMOTE CONTROL
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
UH AND NOW IN A MORE UH GENERAL UH UH BROAD WAY OF SEEING TH UH THE THING
IF WE LOOK BACK AND NOT UH LOOK AT ONLY REMOTE CONTROLS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT THE TRENDS ARE QUITE THE SAME IN MANY AREAS SO CURRENTLY THE THE TRENDS THAT WE SEE IN L IN L BIG CITIES LIKE PARIS AND MILAN
WELL IT SEEMS THAT THIS YEAR THINGS SHOULD HAVE UH A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE UH WAY OF OF LOOK OR FEEL OR SO
AND I THINK OF COURSE UH I IT APPLIES TO EVERYTHING
THAT'S THE THING WITH TRENDS
IT IT CAN TRAVEL F FROM CLOTHE TO FURNITURE SAME IDEA
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
THINK FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
AND UH IF WE CO WE COMPARE TO LAST YEAR NOW IT HAS TO BE SPONGY YEAH
WELL THIS SO SO I THINK UH UH I
WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RUBBER I THINK UH THE RUBBER ASPECT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT IS PROBABLY MORE FEASIBLE IN TERMS OF SPONGINESS
SEEMS NOT SEEMS NOT
YEAH
SO
THINK MORE OF UH SOMETHING IN THE COLOURS OF UH LIKE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND SPONGY
AS A EVEN IN THE SHAPE IT HAS TO BE MORE ROUND AND UH
MORE UH UH LOOK NATURAL SOMEHOW
I MEAN
AND NOT THOSE FUTURISTIC UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH ANGLES AND UH AND TITANIUM LIKE
SO THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SEEM TO YEAH I I KNOW IT'S QUITE FAR FROM WHAT YOU THOUGHT BUT THAT'S THAT'S FASHION AND
OKAY THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY
THESE I'M SORRY
YEAH YEAH WE HAVE PEOPLE UH UH LISTENING TO THE TRENDS EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD OF COURSE
AS YOU KNOW OUR COMPANY IS QUITE BIG AND UH SO I'M JUST ASKING THEM WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS ACCORDING TO THEM WHEN THEY GO IN THE STORES AND WHEN THEY ASK UH THEIR UH FRIENDS THAT ARE ALSO WELL
NO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THIS THIS IS VERY GENERAL YEAH
BUT IT SEEMS THAT TRENDS TRAVEL ACROSS THINGS
THE WHAT WE
SURE
YEAH
WE HAVE TO I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THE LOOK OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES BUT WE STILL HAVE TO PUT OUR CHIPS INSIDE SO OF COURSE
THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM
THIS IS NOT MINE
YEAH I THINK IN THE COLOURS AND IN THE UH THE KIND OF MATERIAL
IF IF IT'S SOMETHING LIKE RUBBER MADE OR I THINK IT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE GOOD
OKAY
YEP
THANKS
MM-HMM
OKAY
THANKS
SPONGY
NO WE DON'T HAVE TO BUT SEEMS IT'S THE TREND
AGAIN AS I SAID WE CAN ALSO TRY TO MAKE IT TO CREATE THE TREND
SO THERE'S NO
WELL THAT'S YOU T CAN TRY TO CONVINCE US
OKAY
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I
UH
I THINK I YEAH I IT'S AGAIN IN THIS UH WHAT I SAID FIRST IT HAS TO BE FANCY SO I THINK IF NOBODY ELSE PRO PROVIDES CURRENTLY A REMOTE CONTROL WITH THAT KIND OF STUFF AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE IT I THINK IT'S A GOOD SELL FOR US BECAUSE WE HAVE IT AND OTHERS DON'T
IT'S FANCY
WHETHER IT'S USEFUL OR NOT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY IMPORTANT
MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLORE THE TWO OPTION
MM
SEEMS TO BE
IF YOU HAVE TIME
FOR CREATION
YOU CAN PAINT IT AFTERWARD
NO PROBLEM
WE HAVE A VERY LARGE DEPARTMENT OF PAINT
YOU WILL DO IT
YEAH
THE THING IS THAT UH IF WE WANT TO HAVE AS HE SAYS IF WE WANT TO HAVE UH A SMALL NUMBER OF BUTTONS WE NEED TO HAVE A KIND OF OUTPUT THAT SAYS CURRENTLY WHAT THEIR ACTIONS ARE
YEAH
THAT'S THE CONVERSE TO HAVING ZILLIONS OF BUTTON WHERE EACH BUTTON DOES ONLY ONE THING
YEAH
CLASSICAL WE STAY CLASSICAL IN THAT WE DON'T REINVENT UH THE WHEEL
ANYWAY IT'S VERY IN GENERAL I THINK PEOPLE UH CHANGE T. V. MORE OFTEN THAN BATTERIES OF THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
SO
BECAUSE THE TREND GOES FASTER THAN THE LIFE OF THE
SO IT'S VERY
OKAY
WE'RE DONE
MM
SO UH NOW IT'S THE HI SAMMY
IT'S THE DETAIL DESIGN MEETING SO WE'RE GOING LAST MEETING
SO UM FIRST UH MARK AND RAMA ARE GOING TO PRESENT UH THE PROTOTYPE
UH THEN UH SAMMY WILL PROPOSE SOME UH CRITE CR CRITERIA TO EVALUATE THIS PROTOTYPE
THEN W WE
AND THEN WE GOING TO DO SOME FINANCE TO SEE IF UH IT IS UH FEASIBLE AND UH AT THE END WE WILL WE WILL UM EVALUATE OURSELF AS A TEAM
AND THAT'S ALL
OKAY
SO FIRST LET'S UH
SEE THE PROTOTYPE
OKAY
AND YOU HAVE SOME SLIDES THEN
YEAH
MM
OKAY
UH SO IN WHICH UH
MM OKAY
MM
MM-HMM
MASA
OKAY
WHAT DO YOU SAY
ONE DAY
HE
HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BOBBY
MM-HMM
HMM
'KAY
ARE COLOURFUL
YEAH
HO HO
THAT'S FOR THE L. C. D. OR FOR THE TITANIUM
MM MM
HEY YOU KNOW YOU'RE THEME TODAY
HMM
AND W WAIT WH WHAT ARE THE STRAWBERRIES FOR
WH WH
MM-HMM
OKAY
STRAWBERRIES
AH
OKAY
MM-HMM
UH WE'LL SEE IN THE FINANCIAL PART IF UH ALL GETS INTO
W
WHO IS THE FIVE UH FIFTY MILLIONS WE FIRST MAKE A PARTY IN
MM-HMM
OKAY
UH SO
LET'S UH YEAH LET'S SEE IF UH TH IT'S MEET THE EVALUATION CRITERIUM
OOPS
OKAY
MM-HMM
UH I THINK THAT FANCY WE CAN SAY IT IS FANCY
OH
I AM NOT THE D THE ONLY ONE CHOOSING YEAH
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S IN THE OTHER
YEAH
MM
TWO
LET'S SAY TWO YEAH
CHANGE COLOUR OF T
YEAH I THINK IT'S A
YEAH
YEAH
MM MM
UM
THE STRAWBERRIES OH
MM MM
YEAH
BUT IT'S TOO
IT'S UM ROBUST YEAH
OH YEAH LETS ME TRY
YEAH
WHAT IS UH NEXT PLEASE
AND YOU CAN UH DO DI TWO SITES
YEAH
OKAY ALSO
YOU CAN BY USING THE
YOU C PUSH HERE THE THE YEAH
LET ME UNDERSTAND WELL BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT'S FOR THAT THIS ONE ARE B D UH TWO DIR DIRECTIONAL BUTTON
YEAH TWO
YEAH
YEAH
AND WHICH WHAT IS THAT
OKAY OKAY
IT'S A KIND OH OKAY OKAY
OH OH OKAY GREAT
NOW IT'S LOOKS US USEFUL
YEAH
YEAH
MM MM
MM-HMM
MM MM
UH OH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT'S
LET'S IMAGINE
AND WHAT ABOUT THE STRAWBERRIES ON THE TOP
I'M NOT CONVINCE
BUT MAYBE I'M NOT TRENDY
BUT UH
YEAH BUT UH UH THEY'RE NOT USEFUL
I I MEAN IT THAT'S UH
MM-HMM
YEP
HMM
I WOULD HAVE M UH I FOUND MORE FANCY THAT THE FRUITS ARE USEFUL
YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT THE N YEAH
MM
NO I'M NOT SURE UH WHY UH IF IT WAS LIKE THIS
I
IT'S N NO IT'S NOT FANCY ANY MORE
OKAY
UH-HUH
AND DIFFERENT ROUTES
OKAY I SEE WHAT
OKAY SO YOU YOU YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING UH A PROTECTION FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
ALSO
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
WOW THAT'S A
YEA
YEAH IT'S FUDGE TITANIUM
YOU KNOW
RIGHT YEAH
AND UH
OKAY
LET'S GO FOR ONE
YEAH
SO IT'S A GOOD EVALUATION
YEAH
MM
MM MM
OKAY
SO NOW IT HAS TO FULFIL THE FINANCIAL CRITERIUM
SO I HAVE AN HERE
UM
OKAY SO TWO

ONE ALSO
I THOUGHT YOU CAN CURVE SOMEBODY
MM-HMM
OH SEE I I THINK THAT THE THE PRICE IS THIS ONE
YEAH YEAH
DON'T CHIP ON ME
MM-HMM
MM MM
YEAH
BUT SHE WANTED U THE FUDGE TITANIUM
I THINK IT'S FIVE BUT YOU DON'T SAY
MM
OH SORRY
AGAIN I'M SEE IT
SPECIAL COLOUR OR IT'S ONLY ON THE
YEAH BUT THERE IS NO COLOUR HERE
SO I PUT IT HERE
HOW MANY PUSH BUTTON
THREE OR TWO
IS THERE THE SCROLL WHEEL OKAY
OKAY
UM
THAT'S THAT'S NOT WE CHOOSE THIS ONE AND NOT THIS ONE
OR ONLY A SCROLL WHEEL
YOU TRY TO S NO NO NO
BECAUSE HOW DO YOU DO TO Y SELECT
YEAH I MEAN YOU YOU GO ON THE LOCATION WITH YOUR SCROLL WHEEL AND THEN YOU
STAY LONGER

PROTOTYPE
UH SO
THIS IS OUR
REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S A R WORKING PROTOTYPE
YOU CAN USE IT NOW BY SWITCHING ALL THESE BUTTONS
SO FIRST I PRESENT AS WE CAME TO THIS PERFECT MODEL AND THEN WE'LL GIVE SOME TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
THAT'S WELL SO THAT'S THAT
PLEASE NEXT SLIDE
WE ANALYSED ALL THE FRUITS AND CONTACTED NASA AND UH MADE SOME REAL GOOD YEAH
IF YOU CAN SEE THIS AND THE STARS ARE SHOWING THAT
AND UM
S SOCIETY WILL ACCEPT THAT
FOR SURE
AND MAKING SOME ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT FRUITS WE CHOOSE THE ULTIMATE FORM ULTIMATE COLOURS AND UH ULTIMATE SMELL OF IT
S PLEASE NEXT SLIDE
BUT WE STILL DIDN'T WANT TO GO FAR FROM OUR TITANIUM IDEA 'CAUSE IT'S THE MOST OF THE MODER THE M
THE MODERN MATERIAL WE CAN P SELECT

PLEASE NEXT SLIDE
UM THIS IS A PROTOTYPE
YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK AT IT AND
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY
NOW IT'S TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION BY OUR
COLLEAGUE
WE ARE STILL WORKING ON TITANIUM
SO R WE'LL START WITH L. C. D.
YOU CAN ASK BOB
IT'S TUESDAY
THAT'S LOCATION SENSORS
YEAH AND WE CAN JUST SOME STRAWBERRY FIRST
UM
OOPS
LET'S MAKE A PARTY FIRST MAYBE

HOW CAN I SAY THIS
IT'S STILL IT'S STILL WORKING AND YOUR DAUGHTER GOT A BONUS
A STRAWBERRY
YOU CAN
YOU GO YOU SO THE BASIC MODE YEAH
SO THAT'S SIMPLE
THE BASIC MODE IS UH YOU GOT JUST TWO BUTTONS AND A JOG DIAL
WITH TWO BUTTONS YOU DO THIS LIKE UH VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN
OR IF YOU GO TO THE SITE IT'S CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN
AND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE TO S TWENTY FIVE YOU PUSH ON THIS
YOU SELECT TWENTY YOU SELECT FIVE
THAT'S IT
NO
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S A JOG DIAL FOR CONTROLLING THE CURSOR ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN
LIKE SELECTING THE MENUS
SURE WITHOUT TITANIUM ALLOY IT'S GOING TO BE LIGHT
OF COURSE
OKAY
OKAY
AND
MOREOVER MOREOVER IT COVERS IT COVERS ALL THE END GOALS
EVEN IF IT IS YOU KNOW IT'S VERY ROUNDED BUT STILL YOU GOT SOME RUBBER FRUIT HERE

BUT IT IS FLAT YOU LOOK
IT'S CURVABLE BUT IT'S NOT CURVED
OH OKAY
MM
MM
WELL N WHY THREE
WHY THREE
FOR BUTTONS
NO BUTTONS JUST NORMAL
THAT'S FOR BUTTONS
BUT BUTTONS ARE STANDARD
WELL AS YOU MAY KNOW THERE'S SOME RESEARCH DONE IN THE FIELD OF PRODUCING ENERGY FROM MECHANICAL ENG I MEAN PRODUCING ELECTRICITY FROM MECHANICAL ENERGY
SO THE POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE DEVICE AND PUSH THE BUTTON YOU PRODUCE ENOUGH ENERGY
TO MAKE ELECTRICITY
YEAH THAT YOU DON'T NEED A BATTERY
SO IT'S SOMETHING LIKE HAND DYNAMO ROBOT
A REAL HIGH TECH VERSION OF IT
OKAY BUT L
WHY NOT
LET'S DO THAT
AND I PROPOSE TO SO UH ABOUT CHIPS
ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT RIGHT
SO PUT MINUS ONE THERE PLEASE
WHY NOT
AND
SO WAS THERE RESULT
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
WHY
OOPS
YEAH
WHY NOT
MINUS
GOOD
AND A BATTERY AND A BATTERY YEAH
NOW IT'S FANCY LET'S ADD ONE INSTEAD OF TWO
WELL I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
I AM NOT SURE WHO WAS PROGRAMMING THIS CALCULATOR YOU KNOW
'CAUSE UH
I WONDER IF WE PUT A. OR B. SOMEWHERE INSTEAD OF A NUMBER
NEXT SLIDE
OKAY
YEAH YEAH

OR LIKE YOU CAN USE THIS JOG WHEEL AND SELECT WHICH EVER OPTION ON THE L. C. D. AND THEN DO ON AND OFF
THEN YOU HA YOU'LL HAVE VOLUME CONTROL
SO YOU YOU CAN PRESS THESE BUTTONS TO INCREASE OR DECREASE THE VOLUME
AND WE HAVE SOME L. C. D. CONTROLS

WHAT A DESIGN
IT'S MY TURN
MM-HMM
LET'S SEE IF THIS YEAH IF YOU MEET
THE EVALUATION CRITERION
YEAH
SO EVALUATION PLEASE
SO
YOU MADE A VERY NICE PROTOTYPE AND UM I THINK
WE NOW NEED ALTOGETHER TO TRY TO EVALUATE IT TO SEE IF IT MAKES SENSE TO DO IT
IF IT FULFILS OUR WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THINGS LIKE THAT
SO MM
UH NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
AS YOU KNOW BEFORE GOING AND UH CREATING AND PRODUCING THESE STRAWBERRY UH REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO FIRST VERIFY IF IT MAKES SENSE IF WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SELL IT
UH SO WE NEED TO EVALUATE IT UM TRY TO DO IT IN A CONSTATIVE WAY AND AS MUCH AS WE CAN
TO SO WHAT I PROPOSE IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO TO HAVE THIS SCALE FROM ONE TO SEVEN
ONE MEANING THAT YE YES UH IT FULFILS UH THE THE CRITERION WHATEVER IT IS
AND SEVEN MEANING NO IT DOESN'T FULFIL AT ALL
AND WE'RE ALL L GOING TO LIST ALL THE CRITERION
I'M GOING TO GO TO THAT NEXT SLIDE AND TOGETHER TRY TO EVALUATE THIS ACCORDING TO THIS CRITERION AND FROM ONE TO SEVEN
AND THEN WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE AN AVERAGE WHICH WILL GIVE US THE VALUE OF OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL
SO MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE CRITERIA
SO THESE ARE THE CRITERION UH I'M I THOUGHT WERE IMPORTANT
OF COURSE THIS CAN BE DISCUSSED BUT LET'S LET'S SEE SO LET'S VOTE
SO WE HAVE FANCY HERE AND WE HAVE THE SCALE
FROM ONE TO SEVEN
WITH FOUR IN THE MIDDLE
SO
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS IT FANCY
IT IS VERY VERY FANCY

THEN WE HAVE UH TECHNOLOGY
SO WHAT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
WE HAVE UH WE HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION WE HAVE LOCATION BASED WE HAVE L. C. D.
CHANGE COLOUR I MEAN THAT'S VERY
QUITE D I THINK IT'S A ONE FOR THAT AT LEAST
AT LEAST A ONE YEAH
ROBUSTNESS UH-HUH
SO LET'S SUPPOSE MY DAUGHTER TAKE IT AND UM AND THROUGH IT AWAY
DO YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT'S GOING TO LIVE AGAIN
UH MAYBE NOT THE PROTOTYPE
LET'S TRY
OH MY GOD
OKAY WE JUST LOST ONE STRAWBERRY
SO NOT AT ALL
IT IS
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT'S NOT SO BAD
I UM UH I WOULD SAY THREE
YEAH THAT DOES MAKE SENSE YEAH
USEFUL
WELL SO THE QUESTION IS DOES IT HAVE UH THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF RE REMOTE CONTROL
SO I DON'T KNOW
THESE BUTTONS ARE UH IT NOT CLEAR
BUT YOU HAVE AT LEAST UH NEXT PRODUCE
UH IT DEPENDS ON THE OKAY
SO BUT FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE THE L. C. D. IS NOT UH TOUCH CONTROL TOUCH SCREEN YOU CANNOT GO TO CHANNEL TWENTY FIVE DIRECTLY
DIRECTLY
YEAH
OH IT'S A JOG DIAL OKAY
UH-HUH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
IT'S MUCH LONGER THAN THAT THAT BEING TWO TWO FIVE NO
DON'T YOU THINK SO
MAY NOT OKAY WE CAN GO
THAT'S UH YOU'RE RIGHT
THAT'S IT'S LESS UH YEAH
BUT IT'S IT'S NICE BECAUSE PEOPLE ANYWAY DON'T GO THERE
BUT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR IT USEFULNESS
SEEMS TO BE USEFUL
BOTH
YEAH
YEAH
UP DOWN OR LEFT RIGHT
YEAH
THAT
COOL
I WOULD SAY THEN UH
TWO OR THREE
TWO OR THREE
TWO
OKAY TWO
SO SIZE AND WEIGHT
IS IT THE THE THE EFFECTIVE SIZE AND WEIGHT THAT THE IS IT UH REAL SIZE REAL WEIGHT
OR BECAUSE IT SIZE IS GOING TO BE THAT YEAH
UH AND AND
IT'S GOING TO BE LIGHTER BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO BE VERY HEAVY F I MEAN FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR INSTANCE
NOT SURE IF UH SHE CAN USE IT
SO SHOULD BE OKAY
UP TO THREE FOR THAT BECAUSE I'M HAVEN'T SEEN THE WEIGHT SO I MUST NOT UH COLOUR AND SHAPE
WELL SO COLOUR IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE THE SEVERAL COLOURS FOR THE L. C. D.
BUT UM IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR WHAT IS THE COLOUR OF THE SH THE SH THE CASE
IT'S A IT'S GOING TO BE TITANIUM
OKAY OKAY
THAT'S NICE
I THINK IT'S GOOD
OKAY
YAHOO
WELL Y YOU KNOW IT'S THIS UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE YEAR
SO
UH I THINK USEFULNESS IS M AS AS I REM UM JUST HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT USEFULNESS IS MUCH LESS IMPORTANT THAN FANCINESS
WHETHER IT'S FANCY OR NOT NOW IT WE HAVE TO DECIDE
BUT THIS IF IT'S
UH-HUH
SO THAT THEY WILL THAT MAYBE THE FRUIT MAY BE HERE INSTEAD
SO IT SEEMS WE ARE NOT SO CLEAR ON THE SHAPE UH
I SUGGESTED THREE
BECAUSE UH EVERYBODY S DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CONVINCE ALTHOUGH IT'S QUITE YOU HAVE GOOD ARGUMENTS
BUT
AND UH THE LAST ONE IS ADAPTIVE
THIS IS NOT R MAYBE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE OTHER ONE BUT UH CAN WE ADAPT IT TO EACH EACH PERSONAL USE
GREAT
FULLY ADAPTABLE
THAT'S YEAH
SO YOU CAN FIT INTO YOUR PALM OKAY
THAT WHAT ELSE CAN WE NEED
YOU DO YOU THINK YOU ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH TI TITANIUM AS WELL
IT'S FUDGE YEAH YEAH
YEAH FRUIT TITANIUM YEAH
WELL I IF IF THIS IS IF YOU ARE READY TO DO THAT THEN I THINK IT DESERVES A ONE
OKAY
NOW WE HAVE TO DO THE AVERAGE
WHO IS GOOD IN MATH
OKAY
TWO POINT ONE SEVEN
THAT'S NICE
TWO POINT ONE SEVEN OUT OF SEVEN
I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD
GOOD THING
WELL THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE EVALUATION
SO
IT SEEMS TO BE GOOD YEAH
WE HAVE UH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
THANKS
AH HA
SO SO HOW MANY BATTERIES DO WE NEED
ONE BATTERY
GOOD
WHY TWO
SAY NO
NO NE NEVER INSTALL
TWO BATTERIES OR ONE
ONLY ONE
NO NO
BUT NO NO
NO NO WAY
YEAH
YOU NEVER USE UH EXCEL
GOOD
IT'S TWELVE BUCKS
TWELVE BUCKS
TWELVE AND A HALF I THINK
OKAY
OKAY ELECTRONICS
SO
IT'S A SIMPLE CHIP
SIMPLE CHIP OKAY
ONE
OKAY
ONE OR TWO
ONE
OKAY
SO THE CASE WHICH ONE UH IS IT IN THE END
LET'S DO A SINGLE CURVE
IT'S FLAT AND CURVED
IT'S CURVABLE
MAYBE THERE IS A SUPPLEMENT FOR THAT NO
IT'S ONLY CURVE
OKAY LET'S GO
THIS OKAY YOU D WE TRIED WE TRIED
SO WHAT IS IT
T TITANIUM

IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE
THAT'S ALL
NO
OH I THINK NO IT'S UH IS IT A SCROLL WHEEL AND PE PUSH BUTTON TH THIS CENTRE ONE
OR ONLY ONLY SCROLL WHEEL OKAY
YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE MAKE UP MAKE US UP
NO BUT YOU SELECT WITH THE TWO D THE OTHER TWO BUTTONS NO

IF I LOOK AT WHAT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE THINGS UH IT'S THE L. C. D. AND THE SPEAKER
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO THAT WOULD
SO BUT IF WE SELECT THE HAND DYNAMO IT'S OKAY WE ONLY WE WE WIN ONE
THAT'S ALREADY THAT
OKAY LET'S DO THAT
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS LEGAL

AND OF COURSE IT SHOULD NOT BE VERY COSTLY
SO
ABOUT THE ABOUT WHAT
YOU MEAN THE EXTERNAL OR
YEAH OF G OF COURSE
YEAH
YOU WON'T
I I THINK IF WE INCLUDE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IT WILL BE VERY COSTLY
S
LIKE S UH YOU YOU YOU SAY WE CAN USE SPEECH
IN THE HAND
YEAH
EXCEPT IF IF YOU ARE FAR FROM THE T. V.
THIS IS IT'S
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH WE SHOULD ALSO OPTIMISE THE THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS
THIS IS GOOD IDEA
SO WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO
AH YOU CAN Y YOU CAN YOU CAN USE IT IF YOU SO CAN WE
S
YOU IT
YEAH
IF IF YOU YOU YOU CAN IF YOU WANT YOU CAN USE TH THE
OR BEFORE THE BEFORE THE THE DESIGN THAT SAYS

FROM THE ACCOUNT MANAGER
YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE SAME EMAIL RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO EACH OF US HAS A ROLE TO DO
IN EACH
WE ALREADY HAVE OUR ROLE
'KAY WE CAN
SO THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF DESIGNS THAT'S ALL
OKAY ALRIGHT
YEAH YEAH
I'M DOING THE INTERFACE
ARE YOU USING THE YOU ARE DOING THE IN
AH
OKAY
MM
UM WORKING ON I
USER INTERFACE
YES
YOU SEE THE SECOND MAIL
YEAH IT'S INSIDE

SEE THERE'S A ROLE FOR EVERYBODY
EVEN FOR THE MARKETING
BUT LOOK AT YOUR ROLE YOUR MARKETING ROLE
YEAH THAT'S YOUR ROLE
MM
YES
MM-HMM
NEED TO COLLECT INFORMATION
UM
I I'M PART OF DESIGN PERHAPS
UH WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IN A
IN A REMOTE CONTROL
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION ASPECT
UH
THAT'S ALRIGHT
YEAH IT SHOULD BE EASY TO WORK WITH
YEAH
UH
WE MAYBE YOU CAN HAVE A SPEECH UH RECOGNITION INTERFACE
YOU JUST TELL THE TELEVISION I WANT WHICH CHANNEL
OR OR YOU CAN SAY FOR EXAMPLE UM
I WANT UH TO LIST ALL THE PROGRAMME TONIGHT
Y YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF UH REMOTE CONTROL IT'S DOING THE SOME SEARCHING FOR YOU SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE CHANNEL YOU WANT
JUST SAY MAYBE I JUST WANT TO PRESS I WANNA HAVE A BUTTON FOR ALL THE MOVIES TONIGHT
OR A BUTTON FOR ALL THE MAGAZINES ALL THE INFORMATION DOCUMENTARY TONIGHT
AND THEN YOU LIST A FEW AND I WILL CHOOSE FROM THE LIST
SO INSTEAD OF PRESSING THE CHANNEL NUMBER I AM CHOOSING THE PROGRAMMES DIRECTLY
YEAH THAT'S ONE WAY OF UH MAKING IT USEFUL
NO BECAUSE NO IT'S NOT VERY A LOT
TH THIS INFORMATION EXISTS
FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN GET UM
YOU CAN USE UH WELL FOR EXAMPLE ANYTHING
THE THE IDEA OF USING SPEECH TO REDUCE THE BUTTON BUT UH AND IT'S MORE NATURAL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YES POSSIBLE
YEAH
BUT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
BUT TH THE MAIN IDEA I WANTED TO S I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT UM THERE SHOULD BE A FUNCTION INSTEAD OF CHOOSING THE CH T. V. CHANNEL
THERE'S A OPTION YOU CAN CHOOSE EITHER T. V. CHANNELS OR OR PR OR THE OR THE CONTAIN OR THE CONTENTS OF THE PROGRAMME
SO IT'S MORE POWERFUL
YEAH
NO
NO BECAUSE YOU SEE NOW ALL THE T. V. PROGRAMMES ARE AVAILABLE ON THE WEBS
THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN X. M. L. FORMAT OR WHATEVER THE FORMAT
WE DON'T CARE
WE JUST SAY THAT THIS ARE SOME CONTENT
WE JUST WANT TO RETRIEVE THE CONTENT AND THEN CLASSI SORT THEM BY THE TYPES OF PROGRAMMES
SOME OF THE WEBSITES THEY ALREADY PROVIDE THIS SERVICE SO WE CAN JUST USE THE SERVICE AVAILABLE
DOWNLOAD IT UH TO THE TO THIS REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEN THERE'S THERE ARE ONLY SIX BUTTONS FOR SIX CATEGORIES OR SEV SEVEN
THE MOST THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN BUTTONS
SO I JUST CHOOSE THE CATEGORY ONE AND YOU REUSE THE SAME BUTTON FOR EXAMPLE TO TO CHOOSE AMONG THE THE SORTED LIST THE PROGRAMME YOU WANT
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE AMONG HUNDRED CHANNELS IF YOU HAVE HUNDRED CHANNELS YOU JUST HAVE SIX BUTTONS SEVEN BUTTONS
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
AH YES
SO
YEAH
YEAH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DISPLAY HERE JUST DISPLAY ON THE T. V. SCREEN RIGHT
GOOD IDEA
OKAY
I THINK I THINK THAT WILL BE REVOL REVOLUTIONARY
BECAUSE ALL THE T. V. UH THE THE REMOTE CONTROL HAVE ALL NUMBERS LOTS OF BUTTONS AND THEN YOU DUNNO WHAT TO CHOOSE IN THE END
YEAH
ALRIGHT
OKAY
AH W W WE HAVE SOMETIMES TO USE THE WHITE BOARD
FIVE MINUTES
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE ARE DESIGNING JUST REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
OKAY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONCEPTUAL REMOTE CONTROL THERE OR YOU JUST WANT TO PUT THE FUNCTION IN
GO ON DRAW SOMETHING
MM
WHERE IS IT
AH OKAY
WHERE WHERE IS IT
HERE
MM
MM
OKAY ALRIGHT
SO SO THE MOST FUNCTIONAL DES MM THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IS TO CH CHOO BUTTONS TO CHOOSE THE CONTENT
RIGHT
WE AGREE ON THAT RIGHT
UH UH FIRST ONE IS TO UH BUTTONS I OR IT COULD BE ANYTHING WITH BUTTONS
UH TO CHOOSE
UH CONTENT S OR CHANNELS
SO WE HAVE BOTH
THE USER CAN CHOOSE W WHICH ONE THEY WANT RIGHT
BY CONTENT OR BY CHANNEL
CHOOSE BY CONTENTS OR BY CHANNELS
SO
AND THEN WHAT DID WE SAY JUST NOW
OTHER THAN THIS
OKAY SO TECHNICALLY HOW THE PROBLEMS THAT HOW TO DO IT IS TO HOW TO GET THE CONTENT
CHALLENGE
OKAY
CONTENT
OKAY SO THESE WE HAVE TO WORK IT OUT
SO THIS ONE OF THE PROBLEM
AND UH
THE MAIN THING
OKAY
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT OKAY
SO WE ARE WE'LL DISCUSS IT WE WILL GET SOME INFORMATION IN THE NEXT MEETING SO FOR NOW WE GET UH THE FUNCT THIS IS THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGNER
THAT'S THE FIRST ASPECT
RIGHT
WE WILL GET INFORMATION AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK IN
YEAH WE'LL COME
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT OKAY
THANK YOU MIS
GOOD MORNING
WELL I THINK WE SHOULD SET THE THE POINTS TO TO DRIVE THE PROJECT AND UH
YEAH FROM THE ACCOUNT MANAGER
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO
I THINK OUR UH RESPONSIBILITIES WILL BE ASSIGNED WHEN WE IN OUR MAIL WE RECEIVED FROM THE ACCOUNT MANAGER
UH
NO I'M DOING THE INTERFACE
YEAH I I'M I'M
WELL MAYBE WE HAVE OKAY SO I INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
IT WAS A LITTLE CONFUSION ABOUT MY UH BUT IT'S ALRIGHT
YEAH
USER
WELL I THINK WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HAS TO BE DONE AND WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THE
WELL W WE WANT TO HAVE A NEW RE REMOTE CONTROL FOR FOR T. V. DISTRIBUTION I GUESS
SO WE HAVE TO PLAN HOW HOW IT WOULD BE DEVELOPED AND UH
HOW WE CAN MAKE IT WORK
YEAH I DUNNO I
YEAH
WELL I I THINK THAT NORMAN AND I WOULD THINK ABOUT UM THE TECHNICAL POINTS AND UM WE SHOULD DISCUSS IT IN THE NEXT MEETING OR
YEAH
WELL YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT WORK
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BIG THING
YEAH
WE CAN THINK ABOUT AN INTERFACE WITH UH WELL
YEAH YEAH
I
I THINK IF YOU WANT T TO CHOOSE UH FROM A LIST OF PROGRAMME OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU YOU MAY HAVE TO TO USE UH W UH I DUNNO
YEAH
YEAH
ON THE CONTENT
YEAH
YEAH IT'S IT'S A GOOD IDEA IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT I I THINK THAT TECHNICALLY IT WOULD BE UM A LITTLE BIT UH UH MORE TRICKY TO TO ACHIEVE THIS THAN JUST TO
YEAH YEAH
WELL I I I I THINK THAT J JUST BY USING NAVIGATION BUTTONS AND THE USER INTERFACE ON THE SCREEN WE ARE ABLE TO UH NAVIGATE UH THROUGH THE
WELL CHANNEL PROGRAMME OR CONTENTS OR IN AN EASY WAY SO
YEAH IN THE DIS DISPLAY ON THE T. V. SCREEN AND JUST UH WITH THE WITH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WOULD JUST NAVIGATE THROUGH THE F
YEAH YEAH
SO
I THINK FOR FOR THE TECHNICAL POINTS WE HAVE TO TO TO CHECK HOW TO GATHER THE DATA FROM PROGRAMME OR CONTENTS AND ALL THIS STUFF
OH RIGHT SO
PLEASE NORMAN DRAW UH
OKAY
YEAH BY CONTENT OR BY CHANNEL IT'S A GOOD IDEA
AND UH WE WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY HOW TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTENTS
YEAH
I THINK I IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO TO BROWSE BY CHANNEL BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT TRICKY TO BROWSE BY CONTENTS SO
I THINK THAT'S THE THE THINGS TO DO AND UH TO UH
REFLECT ABOUT IT AND UH
DISCUSS IT IN THE NEXT MEETING
OKAY
THANK YOU EVERYBODY
OKAY
GOOD MORNING
OR YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE SHARED FOLDER
NO I DIDN'T GET IT
THIS ONE
NO
NO
I THINK IT'S FOR YOUR GUYS TO HOW TO DESIGN IT ALL THE ASPECTS SO YOU NEED THAT INFORMATION
YEAH I THINK ASSIGN YOUR UH ROLES
FOR EACH PERSON YEAH
UH I'M INTO MARKETING
YEAH NOTHING MUCH IN THE PROJECT
MARKETING IN THIS DESIGN
A DESIGN IS BASICALLY FOR INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND THE USER INTERFACE
YEAH THIS IS
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT FIRST
US USER DEFINE
THERE'S A TREND WATCHING
YEAH
I MEAN WORKING REMOTES WE ALREADY HAVE
THIS WILL BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER REMOTES REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
I'M A OKAY
I MEAN THE MAIN UH FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS TO HAVE SOMETHING IN THE HAND AND WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
IF WE ARE GOING TO ADD A SPEECH INTERFACE
I'M NOT SURE WITH TRENDY SLIM SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IT WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT A SPEECH RECOG IF YOU WANT TO PUT A SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM F INTERFACE FOR THAT I THINK THE T. V. ITSELF COULD HAVE IT
AND I COULD TALK TO THE T. V. TELEVISION ITSELF
I NEED NOT HAVE AN
I MEAN WE HAVE SOME OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY BUT
MM-HMM YEAH
AND ANOTHER INTERESTING IDEA FOR THIS WOULD BE TO HAVE AN LIGHT ADAPTATION SYSTEM DEPENDING UPON THE PICTURE OF
SO I MEAN IF YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE AND SUDDENLY THERE IS A DARK UH SOME DARK SCENE THE LIGHTS ADAPT THEMSELF
THE LIGHTING IN THE ROOM CHANGES
I MEAN WE HAVE A OPTION IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
IF WE WANT TO HAVE THAT OPTION YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON IN THE REMOTE
OH I'M AFRAID YOU FORGOT TO PUT YOUR LAPEL
THE LAPEL
YEAH THAT ONE
JUST PLUG IT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
SO WE COME AGAIN FOR THE THE SECOND MEETING
UH FOR THE AIM OF THIS
MEETING
NOW IS TO
TO MAKE PRESENTATION ABOUT
UH THE WORK FOR EACH ONE
AND TAKE THE THE DECISION ABOUT THE THE DESIGN AND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE THE REMOTE
CONTROL
AND WE HAVE THINK I GOT A NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENT
SO I THINK
UH TELETEXT BECOMES OUTDATED
SO THE POPULARITY OF THE SINCE THE POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET AND I THINK WE DON'T NEED LIGHTING ADAPTIVE
SO THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE ONLY USED FOR THE THE TELEVISION
AND OF COURSE WE SHOULD HAVE OUR IMAGE
IN THE IN THE DESIGN
SO LET'S START WITH THE
THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
OR Y YOU CAN USE THE WHITEBOARD IF YOU WANT
HERE
OH OKAY
THIS ONE
DO YOU WANT TO OPEN
AH
WOW
THIS
YOU CAN I YEAH
MA
YEAH WE CAN CHANGE THE B
YEAH
UM
IT'S MINE
PARTICIPANT ONE NO
MM
OH WE HAVE SO LET'S MOVE TO
TO USER INTERFACE DESIGN
PARTICIPANT
DURING THE WEEKEND
THAT'S GOOD
MM-HMM
THIS ARE USUAL FUNCTIONALITY
TASKS
AND THEY ARE SMALL
MM-HMM
YEAH
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE PA PA PROCESSING WILL BE DONE ON THE T. V.
THAN THE
SO WE SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIC T. V.
OR
WE CAN USE THIS
YEAH WE DON'T
YEAH I THINK SO
J J JUST THE REMOTE CONTROL
MM
YEAH WE
YEAH
SPEECH RECOGNITION
KEEP THE NAVIGATION BUT
SO YOU ARE
MM
HOW THE THIS REMOTE
YEAH OF COURSE SMALL
PARTICIPANT FOUR
SO HARRY
MM-HMM
BUT DO YOU THINK WHAT THEY SUG SUGGESTED S POSSIBILITY
YEAH
IT
YEAH
BUT IS IT USEFUL OR NOT U
I DON'T KNOW
THERE IS IN THE
MM
I THINK I
IF IT'S NECESSARY CAN YOU CAN DO THAT
WE CAN INTEGRATE SMALL MICROPHONE IN THE REMOTE SO IT'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM
WHAT ABOUT LIGHTING ADAPTIVE OPTIONS
ACCORDING TO THE RE TO THE NEW REQUIREMENTS I THINK WE DON'T NEED THAT
YEAH
MM
SO WE HAVE I THINK WE HAVE S STILL WE HAVE
COUPLE OF MINUTES
MM MM
SO ANY THINGS TO
TO DISCUSS
OR ANY SUGGESTIONS
EXPENSIVE
PRICE
I THINK WE WE CAN WE
IS THE
YEAH
SO YOU HAVE TO ANTICIPATE THE THE FUTURE
IN FUTURE
OKAY
SO LET'S GO FOR THE THE LUNCH BREAK AND
WE WILL MEET AFTER
MM-HMM
OKAY
BECAUSE IT'S OPEN YOU MEAN
F. FIVE
DID YOU DRAW IT
THIS
WHAT IS THE OTHER CHIP FOR
THE ONE ON TOP
FOR MEN
TO THE IN
OKAY
MM
WHAT IS F. P. G. A.
SO WHY'S IT HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE BLUETOOTH
YEAH
PROGRAMME IT
OKAY
YEAH
UH
SO THIS ARE THE THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER
OR
DO THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER OR TWO SEPARATE CHOICE
OKAY
IS THE IS THE SOFTWARE PAR ALRI OKAY
OKAY OKAY
SO YOU CAN CONTROL IF YOU WANT RIGHT
MM
MM
MM
MM
YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE CHARGER WHEN UH YOU WHEN YOU DON'T NEED TO USE IT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
MM
UH MM
Y YEAH YEAH
BECAUSE YOU ARE USING BECAUSE YOU ARE USING BLUETOOTH IF SOME PEOPLE HAVE P. D. A. THEY CAN USE THEIR P. D. A. TO CONTROL THE T. V. IF THEY WANT TO RIGHT
I DUNNO
SO IS MINE
OH
YEAH THIS YOUR
YEAH
SO YOU CAN OPEN UH THREE
YEAH
SO
SO I'M WORKING ON THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
CAN YOU SHOW THE NEXT SLIDE
SO THE THE PURPOSE IS TO TO FIND UH THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ASK IS WHAT EFFECT SHOULD THE APPARATUS HAVE
SO SO I FOUND ON A WEBS ON THE INTERNET YEAH
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME SEARCHING AND UH AND I FOUND THAT UH THE FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO TELEVISION SET
FOR EXAMPLE SWITCH ON SWITCH OFF SWITCH THE NEXT CHANNEL AND SO ON AND SO ON
SO I FOUND TWO VERY GOOD PROTOTYPES FOR FOR THIS INTERFACE FROM OUR COMPETITORS SO CAN YOU
YEAH YEAH YEAH
OURS IS A BIT UH DIFFERENT
SO THESE ARE TWO EXAMPLE
ONE IS FROM THE OTHER ONE IS FROM YEAH UH ENGINEERING CENTR YEAH
THIS IS THE MOST COMPETING PROTOTYPES I'VE FOUND
BUT THEN UH LOO BUT THEN I FOUND IF YOU LOOK AT YOU SEE ON THE LEFT ONE THERE ARE TOO MANY BUTTONS
YEAH
O ON THE RIGHT I TRIED TO PLAY WITH THE PROBLEM IS THAT UH IF I HAVE HUNDRED CHANNELS I HAVE UH I HAVE TO CHOO PRESS THE OTHER BUTTON TO CHOOSE THE HUNDRED CHANNELS AND I HAVE TO COMPOSE THE NUMBER SO IT'S VERY LOUSY
SO YOU SO YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT THE NEXT ONE
YEAH SO I TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEM
AND THEN I I LOOK AT THE USER MANUAL THEY ARE A HUNDRED PAGES THICK SO WE DON'T WANT THAT
SO I PROPOSE THE EASY TO USE UH PROTOTYPE
YOU CAN NAVIGATE ON T. V. SCREEN AND WE CAN THE USER'S PREFERENCE AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE T. V. CONNECTED TO INTERNET SO WE END IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE T. V. PROGRAMMES BY X. M. L. AND WE NEED SOME TO DO SOME PREPROCESSING
FROM THE TECHNICAL ASPECT THE PROCESSING SHOULD BE DONE ON THE T. V. SET THAN ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROLLER RIGHT
AND THEN WE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AS UH HARRY SAYS WE MAY JUST PUT IN WE MAY K. I. V.
YEAH ALL THE PROCESSING IS DONE THE T. V. IS A COMPU HAS SOME PROCESSING POWER THE
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE ARE YOU JUST WONDERING WHAT CONTROLLER OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
SO I THE PROCESSING ON ON THE REMOTE CONTROLLER SO IT CAN U BE USED IN ANY T. V. ANY CONVENTIONAL T. V. SETS
MM
OKAY
N YEAH THAT'S ALL
THE NEXT ONE
SO I COME UP WITH A SIMPLE DESIGN JUST KEEP THE V NAVIGATION BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
OKAY THAT'S ALL
MM
MM
NO BECAUSE YOU CHOOSE BY CHANNEL SO YOU CHOOSE BY T. V. PROGRAM SO YOU DON'T HAVE HUNDRED CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM
IF YOU GO BY CHANNEL YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT
AH
AH A BIG JUMP
A MOUSE OR
YEAH
MM
MM-HMM
UH IT'S GONNA BE SMALL
YEAH
SO IT'LL BEEP IF YOU WANNA FIND IT YOU JUST UH SHOUT Y H JUST IT JUST HAS TO RE RESPOND TO YOU WHEN YOU LOOK FOR THE DEVICE
I DUNNO HOW BU
AND RESPONDS TO YOU AND
I MM
BUT I THINK IF YOU TO RECOGNISE NUMBERS IT'S A WELL STUDIED PROBLEM
I IF YOU JUST RECOGNISE UH NUMBERS IS A LIMITED YOU HAVE LIMITED VOCABULARY
MM
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
BUT
MM
YEAH
I NO I I THINK THAT UH I IF WE GO FOR QUALITY PEOPLE MAY TOLERATE FOR HIGH QUALITY AND OF COURSE COMES WITH UH REASONABLE COST
MAYBE NOT LESS BUT THEY MAY BE WILLING TO PAY
LITTLE BIT MORE FOR COMFORT YEAH EXTRA FEATURES
MM
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
WHAT IS THE TELETEXT
MM
IT IS INTERESTING BUT WE ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
SO YOU NEED S SPECIAL T. V. SETS TO DO THAT
OR IT'S IT'S DONE VIA THIS REMOTE CONTROLLER
IT'S VERY COMPLEX
MM
YEAH THEN WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE BUT MAYBE NOT IN THIS PROJECT
MM
MM
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
MM
MM
USING THE T. V. TO ACCESS THE INTERNET
OR WHAT
I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
THE FUTURE DEMAND MARKET DEMAND
THE FUNCTIONALITY IN THE FUTURE
ALRIGHT
YEAH
BECAUSE ALL THE T. V. SETS WILL BE DIGITAL RIGHT
ALL THE PROGRAMMES EVERYTHING WILL BE IN DIGITAL THAN ANALOG
TH THE SYSTEM WILL CHANGE AND WE HAVE TO ANTICIPATE FOR THOSE CHANGE
OKAY
THANK YOU
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH ALRIGHT
SO UH
WELL I HAVE A POWERPOINT PR PRESENTATION STORED IN MY
IN MY PERSONAL FOLDER SO I I I THINK YOU CAN REACH IT FROM HERE
PARTICIPANT TWO
YEAH
UH OPEN
RIGHT SO UM I WILL TALK ABOUT THE THE W WORKING DESIGN AND
AND UM WELL I I WILL PRESENT MY MY FIRST IDEA ON HOW TO BUILD THE OUR NEW REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION
SO UH CAN YOU GO ONE PAGE DOWN PLEASE
SO I THINK THE FIRST THINGS TO DO IS TO DEFINE THE HARDWARE COMPONENTS NEEDEDS TO ACHIEVE UH WHAT WE WANT TO DO
SO UH MM I'M THIN UH I THINK UH I I'LL DO A SURVEY ABOUT WHAT IS UH WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET AND WHAT WHAT IS THE THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE THINGS WE HAV WE CAN USE
THEN UH I WILL TRY WITH THE TECHNICAL TEAM TO TO BUILD A PROTOTYPE AND TO SEE UH WITH UH H HOW THIS LITTLE BOX WOULD UH LOOK LOOK LIKE
AND HOW AN AND WE CAN UH START TROUBLESHOOTING FIRST UH COM COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
AND WHEN WE ARE READY WITH THIS FIRST PROTOTYPE I I THINK WE CAN ADD SOME SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITIES ON A PROGRAMMABLE CHIP LIKE BROWSING BY CONTENT OR UM THINGS LIKE THAT
OKAY SO CAN YOU GO DOWN UH
SO
WHA WHAT I THINK FOR NOW IS WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL W WHICH IS WIRED SO UH I THINK WE U WE CAN USE A BATTERY FOR THE
THEN TWO PROGRAMMABLE CHIPS FOR BOTH SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITIES AND COMMUNICATION
AND THE COMMUNICATION WITH THE T. V. SET IS UH MADE THROUGH UH INFRARED COMMUNICATION
SO UH THIS IS THE THE SCHEMA OF THE O OF THE FUTURE UH REMOTE CONTROLS SO UH YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE THE COMPONENTS
UH BATTERY AND UH THE TWO CHIPS GOES TO THE INFRARED UH CONNECTION TO THE T. V. SET
THE ONE ON TOP IS FOR THE UM WELL THE FUNCTIONALI THE FUNCTIONALITIES AND THE THE TH RED UM SORRY THE GREEN ONE IS IS TO WELL
PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER UM F TRANSFORM THE DATA INTO UH QU INTO THE FORMAT TO TO UH TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE T. V. SET
AND THAT'S IT
I THINK WE SHOULD USE A F. P. G. A. FOR FOR THE FUNCTIONALITIES WHICH IS EASY TO TO T
IT'S FIELD PROGRAMMABLE UH SOMETHING ARRAY
YEAH
WELL UH A F. P. G. A. IS JUST A CHIP YOU CAN UH YOU CAN PR PROGRAMME IT UH WI WITH WH WHATEVER YOU WANT
AND UH WELL THE BLUETOOTH CHIP IS JUST RESPONSIBLE TO UH MAKE THE COMMUNICATION UH BETWEEN UH THE TWO DEVICES
NO
WELL TH THE F. P. G. A. WILL PRODUCE THE THE DATA TO SEND
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT AND THAT'S IT FOR THE WORKING DESIGN
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
UH NO NO NO NO I THINK UH WE HAVE UH TO TO UH HAVE UH EMBEDDED UH B BATTERIES IN IN THE YEAH INTO THE T
YEAH YEAH
AND UH I I DON'T THINK IT WILL NEED UM VERY UH MUCH POWER TO MAKE IT RUN SO
YEAH
IT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
ALSO BUT BUT I I I THINK UH THE THE GOAL IS TO SELL OUR REMOTE CONTROL
S OKAY SO CHARGER FOR IS THE
YEAH
OF COURSE
SO WE HAVE TO T
WE HAVE TO SELL A T. V. WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL TOO
I THINK THERE THERE IS THERE IS AL THERE THERE IS A A TECHNOLOGY LIKE SHOW VIEW WHO IS ALREADY AVAILABLE ON MOST OF THE T. V. SET ON RECORDERS OR THING LIKE THAT AND WE CAN TRY T TO GET THIS INFORMATION ON TO THE REMOTE CONTROL TO TO DO THE PROCESSING ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE
YES THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I THINK
WE D WE DON'T WE WE DON'T NEED REALLY MUCH BUTTONS TO I IF WE HAVE A SCREEN TO NAVIGATE ON ON THE T. V. SO UH
WELL F FOUR FIVE BUTTONS IT'S SUFFICIENT
IT'S EASY TO BUILD
IT DOES NOT CONSUME MUCH POWER
WELL THEN Y YOU YOU GO TO THE MAIN MENU AND UH YOU HAVE UH GO TO CHANNEL AND THEN UH YOU CAN
YEAH
MAYBE YOU
BUT UH I I THINK I I IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO TO MAKE UH WELL A A BIG JUMP BUT UH WELL YOU YOU HAVE TO TO HAVE A A A DEVICE WHEN YOU COULD YOU COULD
WELL NOT A MOUSE BUT UH SOMETHING THAT THAT SAYS MORE CLEARLY THAT UH RIGHT LEFT UP DOWN
WELL THE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO TO WRITE SOMETHING TO THE NAVIGATOR MAYBE DIRECTLY OR
SO WE CAN THINK OF BUTTONS LIKE IN THE TELEPHONE TO SEND MESSAGES OR THINGS LIKE THAT
BUT WE'LL SEE
OKAY SO UH NEXT PRESENTATION
MM
WELL I I THINK IT WILL BE A YES A BIT COMPLICATED TO UM MAKE A SPEECH RECOGNISERS RUNS ON THE SMALL UH TS
YEAH
AND THIS CAN ALLOW TO CHOOSE THE THE PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE WITHOUT UH ADDING UH BUTTONS
SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
YEAH S S SPEECH IS A IMPORTANT EXTRA FEATURE I THINK
WELL UH
WELL
WE ARE WE WE JUST HAVE TO FIND A MEAN HOW TO TO ADD A M A A A MICROPHONE OR UH WELL YES A MICROPHONE INTO THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO
I WELL IT WILL BE ALRIGHT
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH I THINK IT'S A BIT COMPLEX TOO
FOR OUR NEXT PRODUCT OUR NEW T. V. SET WITH UH AUTOMATICAL UH SOUND ADJUSTMENT LIGHT
FUNCTION
YEAH BUT WELL WHAT ABOUT THE THE NEW PROJECT'S REQUIREMENT
I I I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE UP WITH TELETEXT NO
YES
WELL SO MAYBE WE WE CAN J WE CAN ALREADY THINK UH ABOUT A WAY TO TO ACCESS THE INTERNET VIA THE TELEVISION
BECAUSE IF
YEAH BUT UH WE CAN THINK THAT IN A FEW YEARS THERE WILL BE T. V. SET THAT CAN ACCESS THE INTERNET
SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA IF I I IF WE I IF IF WE UH THINK ABOUT HOW TO TO TO BUILD UP OUR REMOTE UH CONTROL W WITH THIS FUNCTIONALITY IN A W WHICH WILL C WHICH WILL COME IN A FEW YEARS
SO IF WE ALREADY HAVE IT IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH TO DESI WELL NOT NOT TO IMPLEMENT IT BUT TO WELL
TO FIND A WAY TO TO ADD TO ADD THIS FUNCTIONALITY IN A YEAH IN AN IN AN EASY MANNER IF IS POSSIBLE
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
SO
OKAY THANK YOU
JUST GO TO EXPLORER
OR OPEN
PARTICIPANT TWO
OPEN UH
SLIDE SHOW VIEW SLIDE SHOW
ONE IS A COMMUNICATION
GATEWAY ARRAYS
IT'S A FIELD PROGRAMMABLE GATEWAY ARRAYS
YEAH
OR IT'S SOMETHING LIKE ISN'T HARDWARE THE FIRST ONE
AND THE SECOND ONE IS FOR THE SOFTWARE
YEAH TO RUN TH TO MAKE IT RUN
THAT'S IT
NO
OKAY AND HOW ABOUT THE BATTERY POWER
UH YOU MEAN THAT BATTERY WOULD BE SOMEWHERE THERE AND THE REMOTE CONTRO THE POWER TO THE BATTERY COMES THROUGH INFRARED
INTO THE MORE COMPACT AND UH OKAY
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
HAVING A CHARGER RATHER THAN PUTTING THE BATTERY CELLS ALWAYS
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT TO HAVE TO BUY THE BATTERIES WHEN THEY RUN OUT
WE JUST MAKE A SMALL CHARGER AND PUT IT
BU
OUR REMOTE WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE IT P. D. A.
G
YEAH NOT THE T. V. S
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
OH BUT YOU HAVE A CATCH THERE
UM ASSUME THAT UM IF YOU WANT TO GO TO IF YOU ARE WATCHING CHANNEL TWO AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO CHANNEL NINETY NINE
THEN
UH-HUH HUH-HUH HUH
MM-HMM HMM-HMM
BUT
YEAH THEN YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
MM-HMM HMM
OKAY
OKAY
TOO SMALL THAT IT GOES UNDER THE SOFA AND WE CAN'T FIND IT
YEAH THAT'S
JUST GIVE IT A NAME AND WE CALL HIM
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
OKAY AFTER HAVING THE INPUTS FROM INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND USER INTERFACE I THINK MOST OF THE POINTS WHICH I WANT TO ARE ALREADY COVERED HERE
AND TO FIND THE MOST INTERESTING FEATURES WHAT THE USERS WOULD BE INTERESTED
THEN WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE PUT A FEEDBACK FORMS IN ALL THE MAGAZINES AND THE USERS SEND THE FEEDBACKS AND BASED ON THAT
THESE ARE THE FINDINGS WHICH WE GOT AND YEAH ADDING OF A SPEECH INTERFACE IS ALWAYS GOOD FOR A T. V. REMOTE BUT THE TECHNOLOGY
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT AS DISCUSSED EARLIER
AN IT DOES HOW FEASIBLE IT IS
OH WE CAN PUT AN LIMITED VOCABULARY AS IN THE MOBILE PHONES
WE JUST HAVE THE
IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE MUCH SPACE ALSO
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY SLIM
AND NEXT ONE WAS THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
IT HAS TO BE OF COURSE A VERY SLIM AND SMALL ONE
AND OF COURSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN IF IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CRITERIA HERE IS
I MEAN WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR A TRADE OFF
THE FEATURES AND THE COST
LITTLE BIT MORE IF IT'S WITH EXTRA FEATURES
OKAY
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
I MEAN FOR A LAZY GUYS THEY COULD SAY NINE AND THE NINE CHANNEL COMES
OR THEY SAY MOVIE NAME OR I DON'T GO FOR MOVIE NAMES BUT ONLY FOR THE NUMBERS ON THE CHANNEL
OR VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST
SO I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO PUT THIS FEATURES
AND THE FOURTH ONE WAS THE TELETEXT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES
MM I THINK
YEAH AS DISCUSSED IN THE EARLIER MEETING BUT I THINK UH NOT MUCH PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS POINT IF IT'S NOT REALLY REQUIRED
I MEAN
I MEAN YEAH IT'S FOR THE UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND USERS INTERFACE DESIGNERS TO DECIDE IF IT'S GOING TO BE WORKING OR NOT
I THINK
I THINK AS I DISCUSSED TH THAT FOUR POINTS WOULD BE GOOD FOR UM MARKETING
THE SPEECH INTERFACE AND UH LESS UH REASONABLE UH COST
AND THE LIGHTING ADAPTATION AND THE TELETEXT
AND REGARDING THE TELETEXT UH THESE ARE THE SUBTITL THESE ARE THE TEXT INFORMATION WHICH YOU GOT ON THE TELEVISIONS
IF YOU ARE WATCHING AN FOREIGN MOVIE YOU GET SUBTITLES SOMETIMES
AND UH IF YOU ARE A FRENCH GUY WATCHING AN ENGLISH MOVIE YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT IN FRENCH
AND IF I AM A GERMAN THEN I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE MY OPTIONS IN GERMAN
SO THE REMOTE IT SHOULD HAVE SOME IT SHOULD GIVE ME SOME FLEXIBILITY OF CHOOSING THE CH LANGUAGES
THAT SHOULD BE A GOOD UH POINT
WE ALREADY HAVE SOME
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
OKAY THANK YOU
SO WE COME TO THE THIRD MEETINGS
I HAVE
GOOD
UM SO IN THE LAST MEETING WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN AND NOW WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
SO WE
WILL TALK ABOUT SOME
SPECIFIC DETAILS
THIS
UH THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED IN THE LAST MEETING
BUT IF WE USE BATTERY
WE WILL OKAY
THREE
WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THIS BUTTON
I THINK IT MAKES THE THE INTERFACE REALLY
GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE EMPHASISE THE USE OF PICTURES
YEAH
MM-HMM
WE SHOULD INCLUDE SPEECH SYNTHESIS IN THIS CASE NO
MM-HMM
OR MAYBE WE CAN INCLUDE THE USER MANUAL IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND WE SHOULD HAVE JUST A BUTTON LIKE HELP AND YOU SAY UH AND YOU IK YOU PRESS THE BUTTON HELP AND MAYBE YOU SEE THE THE USER M MIGHT IN THE IN THE T. V.
YEAH
ON T. V. T. V. SCREEN
SO JUST YOU PUSH THE BUTTON AND WE WILL
YEAH
IF THE IF
NO IN THE CASE WHERE THEY NEED HELP IN THE CASE WHERE THEY NEED HELP
YEAH
IT'S JUST FOR USER CUSTOMIZABLE FOR KIDS OR OLD PEOPLE
SO
SO IT'S THE SAME
CAN BE USED BY BOTH KIDS AND OLD PEOPLE
MAYBE FOR KIDS KIDS THEY LIKE UH T NO L THEY LIKE TO
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU CAN USE THIS SCREEN INSTEAD OF THE BIG SE SCREEN INSTEAD OF USE THE YEAH
HMM
BUT
YEAH
MM
IT'S FOR IT'S JUST FOR SMALL VOCABULARY
WE IT'S NOT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
PUSH PUSH
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OTHER BUTTONS ARE NOT NECESSARY OR IMPORTANT
BUT THEY ARE JUST LESS USED COMPAR YEAH
OR MAYBE WE CAN U UH OR MAYBE WE CAN UH MAKE THIS THE TEN PERCENT OF BUTTON MORE BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS
SO
MM
IT'S
AND I THINK IT'S INCREASES THE COST OF THE THE REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU USE L. C. D.
I
YOU WILL LISTEN TO A PEEP SPECIAL PEEP
OKAY
YEAH
BUT YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE THE THE CHARGER
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT
OKAY
MAYBE FOR SOME PEOPLE LAZY PEOPLE
YEAH YEAH
MM
OR
OR MAYBE YOU HAVE TO TO SHOW SOME SPECIFIC PROGRAMMES FOR KIDS AND THEN JUST JUST YEAH JUST PUSH UH KIDS BUTTON SO IT'S AUTOMATICALLY
SO IF HE
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH IT'S YEAH
MM-HMM
OR JUST
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TO JUST SAY THE THE NAME OF THE CHANNEL
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO SAY JUST THE NAME OF THE CHANNEL
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO S T UH A CH YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO TO HAVE ALL THE NAME OF THE CHANNEL IN YOUR VOCABULARY
OR MAYBE
OR MAYBE THE USER CAN CREATE HIS OWN VOCABULARY JUST PRONOUNCING THE THE NAME OF CHANNELS AND INCLUDE IN THE VOCABULARY
OR LETS THE USER CREATE HIS OWN VOCABULARY
OF CHANNEL
NO
JUST YOU HAVE UH IN THE BEGINNING YOU HAVE
UH T YOU HAVE TO TRAIN YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE VOCABULARY BY YOURSELF
BY ASSOCIATING EACH CHANNEL WITH THE NAME OR
AND FOR EACH ONE HAS HIS OWN
OR YOU HAVE TO S
YEAH
MM
OR WE CAN SWITCH ON OR SWITCH OFF THE THE SPECIAL YEAH
MAYBE WE'LL DISCUSS THEM IN NEXT MEETING
IT'S TIME TO CLOSE THIS MEETING
YEAH
OKAY
THANKS FOR YOUR COLLABORATIONS
MM
MM
MM
SORRY
WHAT IS THIS SINGLE CURVED WHAT DOES IT MEAN
SO IT'S IT'S NOT
YO L YEAH
WHEN YOU HOLD ON IT IT IS COMFORTABLE TO HOLD
OKAY
YEAH
AND THE BATTERY IS IT KIND OF A RECHARGEABLE OR IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS BY KINETIC
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM
MM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
WE WE MIGHT CHECK WITH OUR R. AND D. DEPARTMENT TO SEE IF THEY HAVE THIS PRODUCT READY FOR MARKET
MM MM
WHA
AH THE DEPARTMENT
MM
UH
SO I UM KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE R. AND D. DEPARTMENT
SO THE TITANIUM CASE IS THE NORMAL CASE THAT I'LL SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES THAT I HAVE AND YOU TELL ME WHETHER THEY ARE TITANIUM CASE OR NOT
'CAUSE I AM NOT VERY SURE PLASTIC TITANIUM OR WHATEVER
THERE'S ANOTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE
IS THAT THE UH WELL YOU'VE SEEN THEM I LE NA MY PRESENTATION THAT UM I POINT OUT SOME WHY BUTTONS ARE NOT THE MM
NOT THE ONLY WAYS YOU CAN USE
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE N
YEAH
SO THE USER INTERFACE IS UH
I IT USES THE ASPECT UH OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM A PROGRAMME WHICH CAN BE SEEN OR HEARD
OR OTHERWISE PERCEIVED BY THE HUMAN USER AND THE COMMANDS AND MECHANISM
THE USER USES TO CONTROL ITS OPERATION AND INPUT DATA
SO YOU S THIS GIVES YOU THE WAYS TO INPUT DATA AND WE HAVE UH WE ARE MORE WE EMPHASISE MORE ON THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE HERE
THE IDEA IS TO REPRESENT BUTTONS AS FIGURES DIAGRAMS
SYMBOLS AND ON SO YOU YOU CAN EASILY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SYMBOLS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS DOING
YEAH
YEAH
SO
EA EASY TO USE
SO NEXT ONE
FUNCTION FIVE
SO I CAN USE THE BUTTON THE MOUSE MAYBE
YEAH
SO NEXT LINE
SO THE HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES
SO THEY CLUSTER THE BUTTONS TOGETHER
THEY GROUP THEM INTO COL THEY COLOUR THEM AND UH THEY HAVE DIFFERENT FORMS AS WELL
MM
BUT THIS INTERFACE ARE KIND OF CONFUSING
UH BASICALLY THERE ARE TOO MANY BUTTONS
RIGHT
NEXT ONE
SO SOME PEOPLE ARE PROPOSE VOICE RECOGNITION AND
SO AH BY THE WAY I RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM THE FROM ONE OUR DEPARTMENTS SAYING THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN USED IN THE COFFEE MACHINE FOR THIS BY A COMPANY WHEN YOU TELL THE YOU SAY GOOD MORNING COFFEE MACHINE AND THE MACHINE ARE REPLY TO YOU
SO I JUST GOT AN EMAIL SAYING THAT
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THIS VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS READY TO BE USED SO WE MIGHT CONSIDER THAT
SUPPOSEDLY
THE NEXT ONE
MM SO SOMEBODY SOME PEOPLE USE UH SOME PEOPLE USE A SPINNING WHEEL TH WITH THE L. C. DISPLAY SO INSTEAD OF USING THE MM BUTTONS YOU HAVE A L. C. D. SCREEN AND THEN THERE YOU CAN U YOU CAN USE THAT AS BUTTONS
YOU CAN USE THAT AS REAL SO SO THAT COULD BE AN OPTION AS WELL
TOUCH SCREEN I MEAN
NEXT ONE
AND SOME PEOPLE PROPOSE A SCROLL BUTTON
INTEGRATED WITH PUSH BUTTONS OR YOU MAY HAVE SCROLL BUTTON INSTEAD OF P JUST THE PUSH BUTTON
LIKE THE ONE WE HAVE HERE
UH NEXT ONE
SO
MM
SO THERE ARE A FEW ASPECTS THAT I COLLECTED HERE
SO S BASICALLY THIS DEALS WITH SPECIAL USERS CHILDREN HANDICAPPED PEOPLE
OLD PEOPLE AND UH
MM AND PROG BASICALLY THEY ARE PROGRAMMABLE SPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN
AND UH
MM YEAH YEAH
AND THEN THEY ALSO SECURE UH COVERS TO PROTECT
UH SECURE AND HIDDEN PROGRAMMING AND BATTERY COVERS THAT WILL PROTECT YOUR SETTINGS
SO
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO INTEGRATE ALL THESE COMPLICATED FEATURES
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THE CURRENTLY IN THE MARKET THERE ARE THERE ARE CONTROL THERE ARE REMOTE CONTROLLERS F CUSTOMISABLE FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE
YEAH SO THAT'S THE POINT
THE NEXT ONE
AND UH YOU SEE THIS IS THE ONE WHERE YOU HAVE THE PROTECTION COVER
MM MAYBE USEFUL FOR CHILDREN THEY MIGH YOU YOU THEY ONLY SEE THE BUTTONS OUTSIDE
AND FOR ADULTS WH WHERE YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL YOU CAN SEE THE ONE INSIDE
SO THE ADULTS MIGHT WANNA HAVE A KEY TO LOCK THAT TO PR SO CHILDREN WILL NOT TOUCH THE BUTTON INSIDE
YEAH
THE NEXT ONE
SO THIS GUY THIS IS ANOTHER COMPANY THAT PROVIDES BIG BUTTONS
AT I SEE THAT THAT IS USEFUL FOR OLD PEOPLE AND THEN YOU DON'T GET IT LOST
BUT FOR OUR PRODUCT WE DON'T NEED A BIG ONE BECAUSE YOU HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION E EVENTUALLY WITH USE
AND YOU CAN CALL YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS
T. V. REMOTE CONTROLLER WHERE ARE YOU
AND THEN HE WILL BEEPS AND TO SAY THAT I AM HERE FOR EXAMPLE
IS IT POSSIBLE
UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND UH THIS IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE YOU CAN UH THE THE THE PART THAT'S A V. STANDING FOR THE VOLUME
SO THERE'S A UP ARROW AND A DOWN ARROW
BUT YOU THE SEE THAT IN THE V.
THE V. APPEARS TO BE THE DOWN ARROW ON THE TOP ON THE TOP UP ARROW IF YOU UP ARROW THERE'S A V. LIKE AS AS IF IT'S TURNING DOWN SO IT'S CONFUSING INTERFACE
SO I WANNA AVOID THIS KIND OF THING IN THE DESIGN
AND HERE ARE IS UH HERE IS A S SHORT SUMMARY THAT I SUMMARY THAT I COMPILED AFTER THE FINDINGS I FOUND
BIG BUTTONS ARE CONVENIENT VOICE RECOGNITION HELPS PUSH BUTTONS SCROLL BUTTONS SPINNING WHEELS CAN BE USED AS NAVIGATION TOOLS
AND UH USER CUSTOMISABLE IS IMPORTANT AND FINALLY SIMPLICITY SIMPLICITY IS THE KEY
YEAH
SO WE HAVE MANY CONCEPTS THERE BUT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE LATER ON WHICH ONES ARE IMPORTANT TO BE USED
AND BASICALLY UH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
MM
MM
OKAY
A HELP BUTTON
SO YOU ARE DISPLAY ON THE SCREEN
SO ON THE T. V. SCREEN
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO THAT ELIMINATES ALL THE COMPLICATED DOCUMENTATION OKAY
SO WI
YEAH
MM
MM
WELL UH WHAT I S PROPOSE IS THAT UH YOU KNOW A REMOTE CONTROLLER I IT COULD BE A CUBE
IS UH A SMALL DEVICE THAT UH LOOKS LIKE A CUBE AND MAYBE YOU CAN JUST CHANGE THE UM THE BUTTONS
IF YOU CH TURN ONE SIDE YOU GET ONE ONE BUTTONS YOU TURN THE OTHER SIDE YOU GET THE OTHER BUTTONS
SO FOR MAYBE NEW GENERATION PEOPLE WHO GET USED TO THE COMPUTER THEY WANT LOTS OF CONTROLS
SMALL
YEAH
LET'S SEE THE MARKET DEMAND
WHAT WHAT MARKET YES YES
YEAH
YES
YEAH
MM
OH
BIG SCREEN
YEAH
MM YEAH
MM
THE THING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IF YOU RE USE THE EXISTING SCREEN WE ELEMENT ELIMINATE THE L. C. D.
AFTER ALL THE L. C. D. JUST TO DISPLAY AND IF YOU HAVE THE COLOURFUL SCREEN YOU CAN MAKE THE DISPLAY COLOURFUL
FANCY AS FANCY AS THE ONE ON THE L. C. D. MAYBE EVEN BETTER
SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MORE ON A FANCY DESIGN
YEAH
MM
REMEMBER WE HAVE A S BUDGET FOR THE COST OF PRODUCING THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
YEAH
SO I IS SO THE THING IS YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW MUCH AN L. C. D. WILL COST AND THEN WE'LL DECIDE AGAIN
UH MAYBE YOU CAN FIND OUT THE PRICE AND TELL US NEXT TIME
IS I IF I
YEAH
YEAH
AND ALSO THE COST FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
ASK OUR R. AND D. DEPARTMENT
YEAH
YEAH
AND HO
YEAH
AND ALSO THE SCROLLER BUTTON HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
YEAH
DON'T USE THE BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IMPORTANT
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH YEAH
SO SO THE AT MOST MORE POWER UH
YEP
YEAH
MM
MM
YEAH
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
I IF MM
MM
YEAH
I THINK THAT THERE'S NO CONTRADICTION HERE BECAUSE IF THERE ARE FEW BUTTONS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR YOUR CONTROLLER ANY MORE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHERE THE BUTTONS ARE
SO IF YOU WANNA CONTROL THE SCREEN D SH SHARPNESS YOU JUST SAY SHARPNESS AND THEN YOU T TURN YOU JUST PRESS LEF INCREASE OR DECREASE BUTTON AND THE SAME FOR THE VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL
IF YOU HAD THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THERE YOU JUST SHOUT YOUR CHANNEL
JUST TELL YOUR CHANNEL AND THEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BUTTO AT THE CONTROLLER SO FINALLY THAT WIL ELIMINATES THE THE NEED FOR L. C. D.
WITH THE HELP OF SPEECH RECOGNISER YOU CAN YEAH
MM
MM
MM
YEAH
A AND
MM
WHERE YEAH
YEAH
MM
PUT IT BACK AT THE CHARGE
YEAH
YEAH
MM
HMM
MM
TH YEAH
MM YEAH
YEAH
MM
MM
THERE'S MM
MM
YEAH
THAT WE CAN WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN PROGRAM A FUNCTION WHEREBY WHEN YOU PRESS THE SWITCH OFF T. V. BUTTON
THE OFF BUTTON THE REMOTE THERE BE S UH INSTRUCTION ON THE SCREEN PLEASE CHARGE CHARGE ME
YOU NEVER GET IT LOST BECAUSE UH EVERY TIME YOU'RE OFF THE COMPUTER THE T. V. YOU ARE ASKED THE THE COMMAND THE T. V. COM REMOTE CONTROLLER WOULD TELL YOU TO PUT IT BACK TO WHERE TO THE CHARGER
YEAH
SO YOU WILL NEVER GET LOST YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS PROGRAMMED INSIDE
SO IT'S IT'S UH IT'S ALL ABOUT STRATEGY Y
MM
MM
YEAH YEAH
WITH UH TWO TWO TWO PARTS CONTROLLER
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
YEAH
MM
MM
THESE ARE PROBL YEAH
MM
MM
MM
MM
MM
I THINK WE NEED TO DEFINE ALSO A S THE SET OF VOCABULARIES FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNISER
BECAUSE UH IF YOU WANT UH SAY WE CAN SORT BY CHANNELS OR SORT BY T. V. PROGRAMS YOU HAVE TO DECIDE A CATEGORY OF VOCABULARIES FOR THEM
IF NUMBERS THEY'RE EASY BUT IF NAME THE CHANNEL BY BY NAME
MM
MM
YEAH
MM
MM
MM
MM
BUT I I I THINK THAT THE USER WOULD LIKE WOU WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE THE CHANNEL OR CALL THE CHANNEL RATHER THAN THAN THE NUMBERS
YOU SAY NUMBE CHANNEL NUMBER FIVE OF THE T. V. CORRESPOND TO SOMETHING ELSE IN THE CHANNEL
SO SOME PEOPLE MAY WANT TO SAY I WANT TO SEE THIS CHANNEL
YEAH
CHECK WITH THE V R. AND D. DEPARTMENT THE CAPABILITY OF RECOGNISER
UH
WELL IT'S CONVENIENT FOR THE USER
THE UH UH MM
MM
I I THINK THAT I HAVE MM MM I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN DO IS THAT UH YOU CAN UH IF WHEN THE USER CH PRESS A BUTTON TO CHOOSE THE CHANNEL FOR EXAMPLE
THEN WHAT YOU CAN DO IS THAT THE YOU CAN MAKE THE T. V. SCREEN TO SPLIT THEM INTO SMALL LITTLE LITTLE SQUARES OF IMAGES WHERE YOU YOU YOU HAVE A SNAPSHOT OF EVERY CHANNEL
SO LET'S SAY IT'S A FOUR BY FOUR MATRIX OF THE IMAGES
SO NOW WHAT YOU DO IS F LOOKING AT THE ALL THE SIXTEEN CHANNELS AVAILABLE AT ONE TIME
YOU JUST USE THE CONTROL BUTTON UH
YOU JUST YOU YOU JUST CHOOSE THE THE OPTION YOU WANT AND THEN YOU JUST HIT THE BUTTON AND THEN YOU GO TO THAT CHANNEL
SO
MM
SO YOU YOU DON'T USE THE SPEECH RECOGNISER IN THAT WAY
OH OKAY
YEAH
MM
YEAH I WANNA WATCH THIS I WANNA WATCH THAT
MM
MM
MM
HMM
WELL YOU YOU STAY A FIVE MINUTES
OKAY SO I THINK I WILL DO MY PRESENTATION ON THE COMPONENTS CONCEPT SO CAN YOU PLEASE UH OPEN UH
I'M PARTICIPANT TWO
COMPONENTS DESIGN
OKAY SO UH THE FIRST THING UH I HAVE DONE IS TO TO MADE A REVIEW TOGETHER WITH THE UH MANUFACTURAL UH DEPARTMENT AND HAVE WHICH COMPONENTS WAS UH AVAILABLE TO BUILD A REMOTE CONTROL
SO FOR ENERGY SOURCES WE HAVE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE SOLAR ENERGY
HAND DYNAMO AND UH KINETIC UM WELL UH KINETIC UH TECHNIQUE TO TO STORE THE ENERGY
WE ALSO UM WE ALSO CAN PUT A REGULAR BATTERY IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
NOW
YEAH B UH F WELL UH I MEANT UH BY BY BATTERY I MEANT UH I WILL NOT HAVE A UH A WIRE BETWEEN THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE ENERGY SOURCE BUT UH I DIDN'T FOU WE DIDN'T DECIDE YET WHICH KIND OF BATTERY
WE WILL PUT INSIDE THE THE REMOTE
SO UH IT'S A POINT TO DISCUSS
THEN UH THE CASE MATERIAL WE HAVE UH UH ALSO SEVERAL CHOICES LIKE WOOD RUBBER TITANIUM OR LATEX
BUT UH WELL
IT'S NOT A A RE UH WELL A REAL ISSUE FOR THE FROM THE TECHNICAL UH POINT OF VIEW
CONCERNING THE INTERFACE UH WE CAN WE CAN PUT MM JUST SIMPLE BUTTONS OR SCROLLS OR BUTTONS UH MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE CHIP TO PROCESS THE BUTTON IS MORE COMPLICATED SO
AND UH THIS IS THE LAST POINT THE CHOICE OF CHIPS
SO WHAT I HAVE F FOUND IS THAT I THINK BASIC BATTERY OR KINETIC UH ENERGY UH COLLECTION IS THE IS THE BETTER WAY TO PROVIDE ENERGY BECAUSE I THINK SOLAR ENERGY WI WON'T WORK IN A CLUTTERED UH UH ENVIRONMENT
SO UM SO I THINK WE CAN START WITH THESE TWO MAIN THINGS
FOR THE CASE UH WELL UH I THINK THAT UH TITANIUM IS UM IS A GOOD CHOICE BECAUSE IT'S TRENDY AND IT'S UH IT'S UH WELL IT'S MODERN AND UH USER ARE ARE ARE MM WILL BE UH VERY HAPPY TO HAVE A A A NICE REMOTE
FOR THE INTERFACE UH I THINK THAT WE CAN ACH ACHIEVE UH ALL THE DESIRED FUNCTIONALITIES BY S JUST UH USING UH RUBBER BUTTONS
SIMPLE BUTTONS AND TH THUS THIS ALLOW TO USE A REGULAR CHIP THAT ARE UH WELL CHEAPER
AND S SO UH WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE
YEAH
WELL UH UH I I IT'S UH IT'S THE THE SHAPE OF THE UM OF THE REMOTE
YOU YOU WILL HAVE THE WELL UM THE THE CURVE WILL FIT INTO YOUR HAND WHEN YOU GRAB THE
YEAH
IT'S MORE CONFOG F COMFORTABLE THAT IF THESE UH IT'S COMPLETELY FLAT
YEAH THE UM THAT'S THE POINT
THE KINETIC ONE IS UH Y YOU CAN RECHARGE UH BY THE UM
YEAH AND BY WELL BY JUST BY MOVING THE AR UH YOUR ARM THE MM WELL THE REMOTE WILL UH ACCUMULATE ENERGY
BUT I D I DON'T KNOW IT'S IF IT IS FEASIBLE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YET IF IF THE USER WILL MOVE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THE REMOTE UM ALL THE NECESSARY ENERGY
YEAH
AND YEAH AND SO CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
SO AND UH THAT'S UH THAT SUMMARIZE WELL WHAT I HAVE SAID
SO UH YOU'RE RIGHT WE CAN UH SEE IN OUR UH R. AND D. UH IF THE KINETIC METAL IS SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY
THAT'S IT
OH YEAH I TAKE CARE IT'S ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM MM MM
YEAH FINE
YEAH
S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT UH AS NORMAN SAY IF UH THERE IS UH ALREADY A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AVAILABLE WHO T WHO DO THIS WE WE CAN CHECK UH TO INTEGRATE IT I INTO OUR UH NEW REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH YEAH
HMM
YEAH
WELL I I THINK YOU IT'S IT'S IT'S FINE YOU HAVE UH REVIEWED ALL ALL THE POSSIBILITIES BUT UH UH WELL UH I IF WE CONSIDER THAT UH THE USER INTERFACE IS DISPLAYED ON THE T. V. SCREEN I DON'T THINK WE NEE UH WE NEED MUCH BUTTONS IN THE REMOTE SINCE WE WE JUST HAVE TO NAVIGATE AND TO HAVE A OKAY OR ENTER KEY OR THINGS LIKE THAT
BECAUSE UH ADDING WHEELS OR SCROLLS UH MAKES THE THING MORE COMPLICATED AND MORE EXPENSIVE ALSO SO
YEAH
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO HAVE A HELP BUTTON
YEAH
ON THE T. V. SCREEN
ON THE T. V. SCREEN THE UH HOW TO USE YOUR REMOTE
UH YEAH
IN A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW
BUT UH WEL WELL I THINK
UH WELL
SO LE LE LET'S SEE WHAT UH WHAT PEOPLE WANT
YEAH
YEAH
MM THE FUNCTIONALITIES YEAH
YEAH
WELL MM W WELL I I I DON'T REALLY SEE THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING UH L. C. D. ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL IF WE HAVE A A A BIG SCREEN AND UH DISPLAY ON THE SCREEN
IT'S YEAH OF COURSE IT'S FANCY TRENDY AND SO ON BUT IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE AND IT'S NOT REALLY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU PLAY WITH THE IPOD YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG SCREEN IN FRONT OF YOU S
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
SO I TH I I WELL I THINK WE WE CAN FOCUS ON THE UH ON THE FANCY LOOK ON THE UH
ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IF THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE BUT WELL I THINK L. C. D. WILL UH WILL UH MAKE US SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR NOT SO BIG RESULTS
SO PRICE OF UH L. C. D. DISPLAY
AND
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
AND
WELL UH COMPARED TO THE TO S THE SIMPL SIMPLER SIMPLEST BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH I THINK THAT
YEAH I I I THINK THAT UH WELL UH AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE IN THE PRESENTATION UH WELL UH ABOUT UH UH FIFTY PERCENT OF THE OF THE PERCENT N CHOOSE THE BUTTON SO UH I THINK TO HAVE UH FIVE UH SIMPLE BUTTON IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR FUNCTIONALITY
YEAH
BUT
BUT THE UH THE THING IS IS I IS THAT WE CAN ADD A FUNCTIONALITY ON THE ON THE T. V. SCREEN LIKE UH A A LIST OF FUNCTION AND THEN YOU CHOOSE WITH THE WITH THE BUTTON TO WELL YOU NAVIGATE AND YOU
YEAH
BUT IF I I IF WE IF WE COULD HAVE A A A DISPLAY UH G A USER INTERFACE THAT IS VERY COMPLETE ON THE T. V. SCREEN I THINK THAT JUST FIVE BUTTONS ARE SUFFICIENT
ONE TO GO UP LEFT RIGHT DOWN AND UH ENTER AND YOU YOU YOU JUST SELECT THE FUNCTIONALITY YOU WANT TO ACCESS OR THINGS LIKE THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TO SWITCH TO A CHANNEL TO ANOTHER UH
YEAH BUT
YEAH BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE L. C. D. YOU YOU DON'T LOOK AT THE T. V. SCREEN SO I I IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH TO GET TO HAVE THE IMAGE IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT
SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL SO WE WE CAN THINK ABOUT A WELL A A VOCAL COMMAND LIKE UH FIND AND WHEN THE REMOTE CONTROL UH HEARS FINE WELL YEAH JUST UH TO MAKE HIM BEEP OR T
YEAH
YEAH
PUT
YEAH
AND THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT'S SIMPLE LIKE IN PHONES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IF THERE IF THERE UH THERE IS NUFF NOT ENOUGH BATTERY
ALSO AND UH UH THE REMOTE IS LOST
YEAH
OKAY
THEY WERE UGLY
THEY
WELL THE LAST ONE WITH THE UM
YEAH WITH THE TWO PARTS WAS UH ORIGINAL SO
YEAH
YEAH
WELL WE CAN THINK ABOUT UH HAVING UH ON THE ON THE ON THE USER INTERFACE WHEN YOU SWITCH ON THE T. V. YOU CAN UH WELL WRITE A CODE OR CHOOSE A CATEGORY
IF IT IS KIDS UH THINGS LIKE THAT
SO FOR MM YEAH
SO FOR MY PART I WILL CHECK THE PRICES THE UM THE PRICES DIFFERENCE UH OF WHAT TO USE WHERE TO USE AND S UH AND SO ON
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK WE CAN WE CAN HAVE JUST NUMBERS FOR CHANNELS AND YOU CAN SAY TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL LIKE UH SPORTS AND THEN ON THE T. V. YOU HAVE A LIST WITH WITH UH UH WELL WITH SPORTS PROGRAM PLAYING NOW AND AND UH
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH YEAH
WELL BUT WELL E EVERY POSSIBLE WORD UH HAS A PROBABILITY TO COME ABOUT OF THE T. V. SO
YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT WELL OKAY
YEAH YEAH
MM MM
WELL I
YEAH
WELL I UH I ALSO
I I ALSO THINK ABOUT UH ANOTHER PROBLEM
IF IF THERE IS UH MORE THAN ONE PERSON WHO IS WATCHING T. V. THE S WELL THE THE SPEECH UH R RECOGNISER SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO
BECAUSE UH I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A YOUNG CHILD WITH MY SISTER WE YEAH WE ALWAYS WANT TO W TO WATCH DIFFERENT EMISSION AT THE AT THE SAME TIME SO IT'S A PR IT COULD BE A PROBLEM IF UH IF WELL IF SOMEONE PASSES BY WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING T. V. AND SAY OH T. V. THIRTY AND JUST RUN
S
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S WELL I THINK THAT'S A GOOD UH A GOOD OPTION BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLE AND UH SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT ALSO SO
OKAY
OKAY
SO I SEE YA
YEAH
YEAH
OH
BUT PEOPLE ARE OFTEN ENOUGH LOOKING AT THE HELP ONCE THEY SEE THE HELP BUTTON THEY SAY OH THIS IS A COMPLICATED STUFF
IT'S A PSYCHOLOGY
OKAY
AND LET US SEE WHAT THE MARKET DEMANDS
WE COULD JUST GO TO MY PRESENTATION
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
I MEAN IT JUST SHOWED US THE REMOTE WITH AN CAP WHICH COULD BE USED FOR KIDS AND IF YOU REMOVE THE
SAME REMOTE WITH SOME
BOTH YEAH
AND THEN WE CAN DECIDE WHAT WHAT WE CAN YEAH
SO
WE JUST MADE AN MARKETING SURVEY OF WHAT PEOPLE NEED FROM OUR REMOTES AND HOW IT COULD BE SPECIAL FROM THE OTHER REMOTES
AND WE GOT THE BEST ON THE RESPONSES FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRES
UH WE ALSO HAVE SOME PRIZES FOR THE MOST CREATIVE SOLUTIONS
AND WE FOUND THE FOLLOWING SOLUTIONS WHICH WE COULD WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR OUR DESIGN
SO SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE USERS THEY FIND THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS VERY UGLY THEY DON'T FIND IT PLEASANT TO USE IN THE SIZE OR USAGE OR ANYTHING
AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THEY ARE ALWAYS L I MEAN THEY ARE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY
IF THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY
AND THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER
AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS
SAID THEY ZAP A LOT
AND FIFTY PERCENT SAY THEY USE ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO THE REST OF THE NINETY PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS THEY'RE NOT USED MOST OF THE TIMES
SO THIS WERE THE FINDINGS WHICH WE FOUND
AND ALSO THEY CITED FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE PRESENT REMOTE CONTROLS
MOST OF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TIME THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR THEM RATHER THAN WATCHING THE T. V.
AND BY THE TIME THEY FOUND THE REMOTE CONTROL THE PROGRAM IS FINISHED
SO THEY'RE FRUSTRATED A LOT
AND UM IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TOO COMPLICATED IT TAKES MUCH TIME TO LEARN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT
SO YOU CAN JUST SEE THE PERCENTAGE
FIFTY PERCENT PEOPLE THEY RESPONDED THAT THEY ALWAYS LOSE THEIR REMOTES AND THIRTY FOUR PERCENT THEY SAY THAT IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO LEARN IF IT'S TOO COMPLEX
SO KEEPING IN VIEW ALL THESE FINDINGS AND THE FRUSTRATIONS I THINK THIS SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION FOR THEM
WE SHOULD HAVE AN L. C. D. ON THE REM REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
I MEAN AS OUR SURVEY SAYS THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE IF THEIR REMOTES ARE FANCY
SO IF WE HAVE A L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE RATHER THAN LOOKING ONTO THE T. V. YOU JUST LOOK INTO A REMOTE AND NAVIGATE IT
IT'S THE SAME MENU AS WE HAVE SAW THAT IPOD REMOTE CONTROL
WE JUST PLAY AROUND
YEAH
YEAH
I MEAN THIS WERE THE POINTS WHICH WE GOT FROM THE MARKET DEMANDS
SO
THE OTHER ONE
YEAH THAT'S FINE
YEAH
I MEAN THAT'S
MM-HMM
UH YEAH WE HAVE UH
I MEAN THAT SHOULD BE FOUND OUT BY THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNERS
AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE AN VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH IT'S O ONLY FOR A LIMITED VOCABULARY SAY EIGHTY COMMANDS OR SO
MM THE SCROLL BUTTON FROM THE SURVEY WE NEVER SEE THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME SCROLLING BUTTON
BECAUSE THEY THEY JUST THEY'RE JUST FRIGHTENED TO USE THE SCROLLINGS OR HELP BUTTON
YEAH
THEY'RE NOT USED MUCH
OR IT COULD BE LIKE THIS AS THE PEOPLE SAY IF THEY HAVE A L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE NOT ON THE TELEVISION
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THE L. C. D. ONTO THE TELEVISION SCREEN YOU MISS THE PICTURE IN THE BACKGROUND WE ARE MOST FOCUSED ON THE COMMANDS
SO IF YOU HAVE THEN L. C. D. IN THE REMOTE YOU JUST HAVE A MENU
AND INCREASING AND LOWER THESE SIGNS HERE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAMS AND THIS MENU WHEN YOU PRESS THE MENU
IN THE L. C. D. DISPLAYS AS YOU GO ON PRESSING THE MENU IT FASTER DISPLAYS VOLUME THEN THE PROGRAM THEN THE BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST AND ALL THE STUFF
AND ACCORDINGLY YOU CAN JUST INCREASE OR DECREASE
YEAH THAT HAS TO BE CHECKED OUT
YEAH
OKAY
I MEAN BETTER IF WE COULD JUST CHECK ALL THE COST WITH L. C. D. AND ALSO WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND THEN WE COULD FIND WHICH WOULD WOULD BE A MORE SUITABLE IN THIS CASE
AND THE THIRD PROBLEM WAS TO FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL
ALWAYS SO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE SAY THEY LOSE THE REMOTES
SO
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN BY VOICE COMMANDER
OR IT COULD BE ALSO SOMETHING LIKE THIS UH IT'S ALWAYS BORING TO CHANGE THE BATTERIES OF THE REMOTES CONTROL
SO WE HAVE SOME ONE CHARGER THERE AND WHENEVER WE DON'T USE THE REMOTE CONTROL WE PUT IT IN THE CHARGER
AND WHEN WE'RE USING THAT T REMOTE AND IF WE MISPLACE SOMEWHERE IN THE CHARGER WE HAVE A SMALL BUTTON
AND JUST BY PRESSING THE BUTTON IN THE CHARGER THE UH REMOTE CONTROL BEEPS WHEREVER IT IS
I MEAN IT DOE IT ALSO DOESN'T REQUIRE A VOICE COMMAND BECAUSE THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH A VOICE COMMAND
YEAH YEAH YEAH
I MEAN CHARGER WOULD BE FIXED BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS WITH ELECTRICITY PLUGGED
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
IT'S AN GOOD REMINDER YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
AND OF COURSE THE FINAL POINT IS A FANCY LOOK
AS WE HAVE SEEN EARLIER THE
REMOTES WHICH WERE DISPLAYED BY NORMAN THEY WEREN'T FANCY I MEAN MM VERY BIG OR SOMETHING WITH LOT OF BUTTONS
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING IT
I MEAN UH I MEAN UH I MEAN UH YOU SEE IF IT'S LIKE THAT EVEN A KID WHO WANTS TO HAVE A CONTROL HE COULD JUST PLUG IT AND USE IT
YOU CAN'T AVOID HIM
BUT YOU CAN HAVE AN BUTTON FOR CHILD LOCK
SO JUST BY PRESSING THE BUTTON WITH SOME CODE YOU T YOU PUT A LOCK ONTO THE REMOTE SO THAT HE CAN'T USE EVEN
MM UH
THAT'S RIGHT
I THINK THESE OTHER FOUR POINTS THEY'RE THE MARKET DEMANDS AND SO IT'S FOR THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGN TO JUST THINK
YEAH I THINK IT SHOULD BE CLEARER FOR US IN THE NEXT MEETING THAT TH UH THESE COULD BE INCLUDED
NO WE HAVE A PROBLEM THERE
YOU SEE UH IF YOU HAVE A VOICE COMMANDS AND YOU ARE S YOU ARE WATCHING A SCORE ON UH BASKETBALL SCORE OR SOMETHING
AND IF THE SCORE COMES TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE YOU'VE JUST SAY TWENTY FIVE AND SUDDENLY THE SCREEN THE CHANNEL GOES TO TWENTY FIVE
SO I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A PREFIX TO SOME NUMBERS
I MEAN THE THE YOU JUST CHECK ALL THE PROBABILITY THAT SAYING T. V. TWENTY FIVE AND JUST ORDINARY TWENTY FIVE
ORDINARY TWENTY FIVE YOU ALMOST THERE'S A PROBABILITY OF BEING SAID AROUND SIXTY SEVENTY PERCENT AND T. V. TWENTY FIVE
I DUNNO IT WILL BE ROUND ABOUT ONE OR TWO PERCENT
SO IT'S BETTER TO HAVE SOME PREFIX BEFORE THE NUMBER
YEAH SOMETHING SOME CODE
THAT WILL BE TOO BIG
AND IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE VOCABULARY ALSO
ALS MIGHT BE YOU JUST FORGOT THE CHANNEL NAME YOU KNO ONLY KNOW THE NUMBER
THEN
YEAH THE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
A AND IN THE SAME LINES WE WOULD HAVE A ONE MORE PROBLEM
IF WE ARE USING THE TELEVISION IN THE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS
SAY IN THE FACTORIES OR IN THE SHOPS WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE AND THIS VOICE COMMANDS IF THEY FAIL TO WORK
THAT WOULD BRING A BAD NAME BAD UH REPUTATION FOR OUR COMPANY
SO I THINK WE SHOULD SPECIFY SOME PRE REQUIREMENTS IF WE WANT TO USE A VOICE COMMANDS
SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE USED IN AN SILENT HOMELY ENVIRONMENT OR S SOMETHING
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT SHOULD BE AN OPTION
I THINK THESE ARE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS
SO WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM IN THE DESIGN
OKAY
OH IT CAME THERE ON THREE MINUTES BACK SO WE ARE I THINK WE CAN JUST PRESS THE OKAY
OKAY
SEE YOU ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES
SO IN LAST MEETING WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND WE ASKED YOU TO PREPARE A PROTOTYPE FOR THE
FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO
SO LET'S SEE THE WHAT
DID YOU PREPARE
SH SHARE FOLDER FOR TH YOUR PRESENTATION
BECAUSE I HAVE HERE
OKAY JUST ONE
WHY YOU WHY YOU YOU PUT IT IN THE THE SIDE
IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE MAYBE
OH IT'S VERY COSTLY MICROPHONE ARRAY
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST THIS ONE
FIFTEEN DOLLARS
AH IT'S ABOVE IT'S ABOVE THE BUDGET
HOW MANY B BATTERY IS THERE
BATTERY
SO ONE ONE BATTERY
IT'S KINETIC RESERVE
MM
I THINK IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE AFTER MAYBE ONE OR TWO MONTHS
OF FUNCTION IS
GETTING DESTROYED
IF YOU
MM-HMM
NO FOUR DOLLARS IT'S GOOD
AND WE WILL WE WILL SERVE THE CHARGER WITH THIS
WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY SO THE PRICE OF THE CHARGER INCLUDED IN THE
MM-HMM
THE PRICE SHOULD BE BELOW TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
WELL THAT'S SO
WE HAVE WE HAVE JUST
THE PRICE OF SELLING IS TWENTY FIVE EUROS
AND THE PRICE OF
PRODUCTION
THAT'S FOR THIS BASIS FUNCTION AND IF YOU WANT MORE YOU PAY MORE
YEAH
OKAY
BUT
MM-HMM
TITANIUM
WHAT WHAT'S
MAYBE YEAH
WHAT'S THE PRICE TO P TO PRODUCE
WITH WITH WITH THE CHARGE
OKAY
WE DON'T HAVE CHARGER
WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE OPTIONS
CHARGER WE DON'T HAVE CHARGER HERE EITHER
NO IT'S
IT'S BELOW THE THE THE BUDGET
IT'S BELOW THE BU
THE BUDGET
WE
YEAH
YOU
AND YOU
MM-HMM
UH
FOR L. C. D.
WITHOUT L. C. D.
UH NO INNOVATIVE YEAH
SO LET'S REMOVE IT
BUT
THIS IS THE PROBLEM
NO IT'S JUST IF I I SEE THE
THE F THE RATE I THINK IT'S BETTER TO DO IT WITHOUT L. C. D.
BECAUSE THAT'S WITH L. C. D. JUST WILL INCREASE THE PRICE AND I THI I THEY HAVE THE SAME RATE SO WITHOUT L. C. D. IT WILL BE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
WITHOUT L. C. D.
YEAH
WHAT A WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE SYS SPEECH RECOGNITION
WHAT ABOUT THE INTEGRATION OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
AH SO IT'S OPTIONAL WITH THE OKAY
I THINK IT WILL BE I THINK I
I THINK IT WILL BE BETTER IF WE HAVE ALL THESE MODULES IN THE SAME REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE MAYBE PARENTS WILL LOSE THESE UH
YEAH
OR MA YEAH
OR MAYBE PARENTS THEY CAN FOR FORGET WHERE THEY PUT IT OR SO MAYB BETTER IF YOU HAVE ALL THIS IN THE SAME
YEAH
SO YOU MEAN THAT EVEN IF THESE MODULES WILL BE WILL BE FUNCTIONAL UH WILL BE OPTIONAL
UH
I THINK IT INC INCREASE
I THINK IT I INCREASES
HMM
AND AND WE WE WE WE WE WE DON'T WANT THAT
SO
PROJECT EVALUATION PROJECT SATISFACTION FOR EXAMPLE
I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE TO ASK THESE QUESTION
WE HAVE TO GIVE ANSWERS SO
PROJECT EVALUATION
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK SO
HE GAVE YOU THE LIBERTY TO TALK AS YOU WANTS
UH THE TEAMWORK WAS VERY VERY GOOD
I WAS REALLY I AM VERY SATISFYING TO WORK WITH
WITH YOU
OH
LESS FANCY
DE
WITHOUT WITHOUT L. C. D. WITHOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION IT WILL BE SIMPLE
YEAH FREE FREE COFFEE
YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND
OKAY
YEAH SO CAN YOU GO OUT TO THE SHARED FOLDER
MM THE SHARED FOLDER
YES
WE HAVE A PRESENTATION
UH
SO I GOT THE PARTICIPANT UH
THREE
W UH
THREE
IT'S THE FINAL DESIGN YEAH
S SO SO I DISCUSSED WITH GUILLAUME
RIGHT
AND UH SO WE HAVE AND WE WE ARE BOTH AGREED ON SOME TWO VERSIONS OF THE PROTOTYPES
BECAUSE WE WERE NO NOT DECIDED WHETHER WE WANTED TO HAVE AN L. C. D. OR NOT BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
SO WE COME UP WITH TWO VERSIONS
ONE WITH AND ONE WITHOUT L. C. D. S
UM BUT BOTH COMES WITH A CHARGER AND THEN DETACHABLE AND UH OR CONTROL MODULE
AND DETACHABLE BIG BUTTONS FOR ALL PEOPLE UM
SO
MM
MM
MM-HMM
NO I I IT'S THE ALL AROUND CAMER UH MICROPHONE ISN'T IT
THE THE MICROPHONE PICKS UP
THE SPEECHES FROM ANYWHERE
YEAH
MM
YEAH YEAH
FOR THE
YEAH
MM
HMM
IS IT N THE TWO A. A. S BATTERIES IN IT
A. A. RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
YEAH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
WE HAVE THE CHARGER SO IT'S NO PROBLEM
ACTUALLY UH IT'S A FLEXIBLE THING
YOU JUST N UH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
AT UH YEAH
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THERE IS ONLY A SINGLE BUTTON THERE B THIS BUTTON YEAH ALRIGHT
THIS BUTTON IS LIKE THE MOUSE IS LIKE A JOYSTICK
YOU CAN MOVE IN THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREES OF DIRECTION SO YOU CAN MAKE A TURN AND IT THE ADDITI FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED TO ALL THE ACTIONS YOU MA YOU HAVE A CLICK YOU HAVE A DOUBLE CLICK
ALL IN A SINGLE BUTTON
YOU CAN MOVE UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT OR YOU CAN DO A SWING
SO A SWING TO THE LEFT A SWING TO THE RIGHT DEFINES OTHER FUNCTIONS
SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S A SINGLE BUTTON BUT IT IS PRETTY S FLEXIBLE BECAUSE OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREE MOVEMENT
YEAH
THIS IS THE VERSION Y THAT COMES WITH L. C. D.
HERE I PRESENT ANOTHER VERSION WITHOUT THE L. C. D.
MM
UH OKAY THIS IS NEW PROTOTYPE UH
YEAH YEAH
MM
OH NO TH ACTUALLY TH WE'LL COME TO THAT POINT IN OUR
YEAH
W W I'LL I'LL COME TO THAT POINT LATER ON
YEAH
TH THEY EITHER THESE WITH THE UH THE THE CHARGER ANY IN EITHER VERSIONS YOU THEY THEY HA THEY USE THE SAME CHARGER YEAH
UH IT'S A STANDARD MODULE SO YOU SHOULD GET IT FOR A CHEAP PRICE UH
IT'S THAT SAME CHARGER THAT YOU CAN USE FOR THE HAND PHONE BUT UH AGAIN DEPENDS ON THE TYPES
I THINK WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE MORE ON THAT BUT
YEAH
YEAH BUT AS THE MARKETING MANAGER SAYS PEOPLE IS WILLING TO PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR GOOD DESIGN
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH WE'LL WE'LL COME UP TO THAT
THE THE THE THING THAT MAKES THIS THE CONTROLLER CHEAP IS THAT IT IS MODULAR SO YOU WANT MORE FUNCTION YOU PAY MORE
IF YOU WANT LESS FUNCTION I I IF YOU WANT A REASONABLE PRICE YOU PAY FOR THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU ADD ON TO THE SYSTEM SO IS UH MODULAR
YEAH YEAH FOR EXAMPLE THE L. C. D. YOU CAN TAKE IT YOU CAN PUT IT PUT IT BACK IN
OR YOU CAN USE THE OTHER ONE OR THE SPEECH RECOGNISER WITH THE MICROPHONE YEAH YEAH
YOU WANT A MICROPHONE TO PUT IN THE SPEECH RECOGNISER YOU DON'T WAN YOU PAY LESS FOR THE SYSTEM YOU SEE
SO
IT'S PRETTY FLEXIBLE IN THE YEAH PRICE
UH YEAH YEAH YOU SHOULD PRESENT THAT
YEAH
YEAH
MM
HMM
YEAH
YEAH THE I THE IDEA THE THE CONCEPTUAL IDEA IS THAT
SIMPLICITY AND POWERFUL
SIMPLICITY MEANING THAT WE HAVE FEW BUTTONS
POWERFUL IS THAT ALL THE CONTROLS WITH THE ONE YOU SAW WE SAW EARLIER IN THE MEETINGS WITH LOTS OF BUTTONS N BUT HERE YOU ONLY HAVE FEW BUTTONS BUT YOU RETAIN THE MM THE SAME POWERFUL FUNCTIONALITIES
BUT IN ADDITION WITH SIMPLICITY
SO THAT'S THE BEST IDEA THE COND THAT THAT'S OUR UH AN INNOVATION UM UH I IN THIS UH DESIGN HERE
OKAY NOW WE COME TO OTHER IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT I DID NOT TELL YOU
THE FIRST ONE IS THE SPEECH RECOGNISER AGAIN IT'S DETACHABLE OR ADD ON
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SECURITY FEATURE FOR EXAMPLE THIS HERE OOP IT'S VERY ROBUST IT DOESN'T BREAK AND THE MATERIAL WHAT'S THE MATERIAL AGAIN
TITANIUM MATERIAL
AGAIN UH AND THE BATTERY LIFE IS UH IS AN IS AN ENDURABLE ONE AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS A. A. BATTERIES YOU CAN CHOOSE THE TYPES OF BATTERY YOU WANT
LITHIUM ION MAY BE A GOOD ONE BUT YOU CAN REPLACE IT WITH CHEAPER ONE AGAIN YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET
AND THEN UM Y THE OTHER P POINTS ARE ROBUST AND MISPLACEMENT REMINDER
SO WHEN YOU FINISH WATCHING YOUR T. V.
AND YOU THE YOU T YOU TURN OFF THE T. V.
UH AND THEN THERE'S THIS MESSAGE COMING OUT THAT UH PLEASE PUT THAT BACK TO THE CHARGER SO SO THAT'S THE OR IS IT THAT'S THE REMINDER PART
YEAH AND UM
AND IT ALSO USE A PROGRAMMABLE CHANNEL AND VOCABULARY SO WE DIDN'T DEFINE THE VOCABULARY SO IT'S UP TO THE USER TO DEFINE SO SORRY
AND THEN UH BECAUSE OF THE CHIL BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE USING THE DEVICE SO WE HAVE ALSO A A OF T. V. PROGRAMMES BY GENRE
AND THIS CAN BE USED BY THE ADULT OR BY THE CHILDREN
SO INSTEAD OF CHOOSING THE CHANNEL YOU ARE CHOOSING THE T. V. CONTENTS OF THE NIGHT
SO IT'S PRETTY POWERFUL AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY THE NUM BUTTONS ARE REDUCED BECAUSE OF THIS FEATURE
YEAH
AND AND FOR THE MATERIALS THAT IS CHEAP TO PRODUCE I THINK UH IT'S QUITE CLEAR FROM YEAH
AND ALSO LIKE THE AND THE FANCY DESIGNS YEAH
MAYBE WE CAN IMPROVE MORE ON THE DESIGN BUT UH THIS IS THE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
MM
SPONGY SPONGY
MM MM
MM MM
BUT THE THE PROBLEM IS THAT UH IS IT ROBUST TO MISHANDLING
WE HAVE YOU SHOULD FIND A MATERIAL THAT IS ROBUST AT THE SAME TIME SPONGY
SPONGY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM
MM
SO SO IS THE E EVALUATION DEPENDING ON US OR OTHER USERS
YEAH
BUT WHO WILL GIVE THE SCORING UH WE OURSELF OR OR A THIRD PARTY
MM
MM
MM
I THINK WE CAN IMPROVE ON THE DESIGN
SOM SOMEONE UM COMMENTED THIS IS LIKE A THE STONE AGE UH DESIGN
UM WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ALL ALL THIS TIME ON THE ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECT FUNCTIONAL ASPECT BUT ALSO THE SIMPLICITY
AS FOR THE DESIGN MAYBE WE C SHOULD HIRE A DESIGNER TO HELP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH FROM THE INNOVATION ASPECT I FEEL THAT UH WHAT IS MOST INNOVATIVE
OF OUR PROTOTYPE COMPARED TO THE EXISTING PROTOTYPES THAT WE SAW L IN THE LAST MEETING
IS THAT UM THE RETRIEVAL OF T. V. PROGRAMMES BY CONTENT BECAUSE UH THAT IS REALLY INNOVATIVE
AND FOR NOW AND ANOTHER INNOVATION WE HAVE IS SIMPLICITY AND SIMPLICITY FEW BUTTONS WE'VE UH
A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITIES
SO THAT IS UH THAT IS UH FOR BOTH TH
OUR GI I THINK THAT THE OUR OUR PRODUCT IS UH HAS THE BEST IN ALL WELL THIS IS A BIASED JUDGEMENT BECAUSE WE DESIGNED THEM
YEAH
UH THE INNOVATION IS V IS VERY HIGH I THINK
BOTH
FOR BOTH
IT'S THE SAME INNOVATION
SO MAYBE I CAN PUT SIX TO SEVEN
BOTH
MM
UH UH UH THERE W THERE WAS A THERE WAS A ISSUE HERE IS THAT WHAT ARE WHAT IS THE DISPLAY ON THE L. C. D.
WE HAVEN'T REALLY UH DETERMINED WHAT ARE ACTUALLY ACTUALLY IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A L. C. D. BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DISPLAY ON A L. C. D.
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT
YES EXACTLY
BUT YOU CANNOT DISPLAY ALL ON A L. C. D.
ANYWAY FOR FOR THE USERS WHO WHO WHO OPT FOR L. C. D.
WE'LL GIVE THEM THE GIVE THEM THE L. C. D. WE GIVE WHAT THE CUSTOMER UH WANTS RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SORRY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
S
YEAH
I HAVE ANOTHER THING TO SAY ABOUT THE EASY TO USE ASPECT
I THINK THE EASY TO USE UH ASPECT IS DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE
FOR THE YOUNG GENERATION EASY TO USE MAY BE VERY COMPLICATED BECAUSE UH THEY W THEY WANTS LOT OF CONTROLS WITH LOTS OF BUTTONS
FOR KIDS THEY WANT SIMPLY THE S SIMILARIT FOR THE OLD PEOPLE THEY WANT SIMPLICITY SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE PARENTAL MODULE
UH WE CAN HA HAVE BUILD A MORE COMPLEX DESIGN IF IF THEY WANT IT
BUT BUT UH WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY HERE IS THAT THE UM WE HAVE DIFFERENT SETS OF BUTTONS FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE
SO IN TERMS OF EASY TO USE I THINK IT'S VERY USER CUSTOMISABLE
USER CUSTOMISATION IS VERY IMPORTANT YEAH
YEAH SO
W UH
I THINK IT'S THE SAME
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
TO IMPROVE ON THE DESIGN
HUH
THE SPEECH RECOGNISER IS A ADD ON MODULE
RIGHT
YEAH
OH
THE PROBLEM IS IF I WE ARE BLA IF A CUSTOMER WANTS A CERTAIN COMPONENT
AND DOESN'T WANT THE PARENTAL CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S A COUPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN WHEN YOU SELL THE PRODUCT IN THE MARKET YOU COULD MEET ANY KIND OF PEOPLE
AND NOT ALL PEOPLE WILL NEED ALL THE FUNCTIONALITIES WE PROPOSE TO THEM
SO WE MIGHT LOSE THE CUSTOMER BECAUSE OF THIS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK UH
YES EXA WHAT DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
YOU ARE MARKETING MANAG
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THE THE QUESTION IS N DOES THOSE MODULARITY INCREASE THE PRODUCTION COST OR DECREASE THE PRODUCTION COST
MM
MM
YEAH
WELL WELL THE OTHER ASPECT IS THAT IF IN THE WHEN THEY HAVE THE AR EXISTING PRODUCT YOU YOU GONNA MAINTAIN THE THE YOU'RE GONNA KEEP THE SAME CUSTOMER
BECAUSE THE SAME CUSTOMER WILL COME BACK TO BUY OTHER ADD ONS
SO SO
YEAH I I SO IF DON'T DON'T BUY NOW THEY CAN BUY I IN THE FUTURE
SO IN IN THAT WAY YOU'RE ACTUALLY KEEPING THE CUS THE SAME CUSTOMER ATTRACTING THEM TO COME BACK IN AGAIN AND AGAIN
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO FOLLOW THE MICROSOFT AND WE DON'T WANT TO THE M
YEAH WELL IF THE BUYERS CAN BE UP THE TH WOULD BE CAN BE UPGRADED IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING RIGHT
YEAH IT DEPENDS ON THE V PRODUCTION
MM
MM
YEAH
WHAT WE CAN CHANGE IS TO PROPOSE THE CUSTOMERS WITH SKINS
FOR EXAMPLE THE I THE MOBILE PHONES NOWADAY THEY SELL DIFFERENT KINDS OF SKIN AND THEN PEOPLE JUST FEEL THAT OH I HAVE A NEW SKIN AND LOOKS BETTER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN PL IN WHAT MATERIAL WOULD THAT BE IN UH
YEAH OR FURRY LIKE A PET DOG KIND OF THING
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU THIS CRITERIA IS IT
ROOM FOR CREATIVITY
THIS ROOM IS A BIT SMALL BUT BUT I THINK IT'S OKAY FOR US TO WORK WITH
YEAH MM
MM
YEAH ANYWAY WE HAVE THE LABORATORY NEARBY TO BUILD OUR MODULES SO IT'S OKAY
GOOD JOB GOOD JOB
THANK YOU
ALRIGHT
MM
MM WE I I KNOW SOMETHING WE NEED MORE CAKES MORE BISCUITS ON THE TABLE WHILE WE HAVE MEETINGS
MM
MM
ALRIGHT THEN WE FINISHED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MM
YEAH
S OKAY SO I'LL SHOW YOU THE THE TWO PROTOTYPES
HERE WE HAVE THE FIRST ONE WITH THE BEAUTIFUL UH L. C. D. UM DISPLAY
YOU YOU CAN S HERE
AND YOU CAN UH JUST UM BROWSE INTO THE THE NAVIGATION MENU BY UH JOYSTICK JOYSTICK LIKE UH BUTTON
YOU CAN UH CHOOSE THE DIRECTION AND IF YOU JUST PUSH ON IT IT'S CONSIDERED LIKE A ENTER FUNCTION
YOU HAVE ON THE MM ON THE SIDE HERE THE MICROPHONE FOR THE FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM HERE
AND HERE THE THE SWITCH THAT CONTROL IF YOU WANT
WELL I I I THINK UH IT'S THE
YEAH BUT
YEAH
WELL SO IT'S A MICROPHONE ARRAY
NO IT'S JUST A SINGLE MICROPHONE
AND YOU I I THINK UH WE WE PUT IT HERE BECAUSE I THINK WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE BROWSING YOUR L. C. D. YOU WILL BE CLOSE TO WELL IT'S BETTER TO TO TO PLACE IT HERE TH THAN HERE
FOR INSTANCE
AND HERE IS A LITTLE SWITCH THAT CONTROL IF YOU WANT THE THE SPEAKER UH RECOGNITION SYSTEM TO UM TO BE ON OR OFF
AND UH SO THIS REMOTE CONTROL COMES UP WITH ITS CHARGER
WELL THIS THIS PROTOTYPE IS UM MADE FOR ABOUT UH WELL FI FI FIFTEEN FIFTEEN DOLLARS FIFTEEN DOLLARS
BUT UH WELL IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UH YEAH BUT UH IT'S JUST A PROTOTYPE AND IF WE UH IF WE OPTIMISES THE UM THE UH VOILA
YEAH THE AND THE THE PRODUCTION COSTS WE WE CAN ACHIEVE UH ABOUT TEN DOLLARS
HOW MANY EXCUSE ME
WELL UH F BATTERY WE USE UH ABOUT UH
YEAH
RECHARGEABLE OF COURSE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CHARGER
YEAH AND YOU JUST
ON UH YEAH ONE BATTERY
THE EXCUSE ME
OH YEAH IT'S JUST A R UH SIMPLE BATTERY A RECHARGEABLE UH IF YOU UH LIKE IT'S EXIST
YEAH
SO AND IF YOU WANT TO CHARGE THE BATTERY YOU JUST PUT THE REMOTE CONTROL LIKE THAT TO PLUG IN THE THE CHARGER AND UH LEAVE IT UH ALONE
IT'S ALRIGHT
THEN THE NEXT TIME YOU PICK IT OH
IT WORKS
YEAH JUST EXPLAIN THE BUTTON UH NORMAN
YEP
YEAH IT'S
SO WE HAVE THE THE SECOND VERSION ALSO WITH THE DIFFERENT UH BUTTON CONFIGURATION
THE SECOND VERSION IS ALSO SIMPLER WE D UH WE HAD JUST UH I HAVE TO PUT THE MICROPHONE ALSO
SO BASICALLY TH IT'S THE SAME UH YEAH
BASICALLY IT'S THE SAME UH THINGS UH UH AS UH I PRESENTED BEFORE
BUT HERE WE HAVE UH WE HAVE UH FOUR BUTTONS FOR NAVIGATION
PRESS ONE BUTTON UH ACTING AS A A ENTER BUTTON
SO UM YEAH ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU SAID IT'S MORE ROBUST TO THE USER
AND UH IT'S ALSO CHEAPER TO PRODUCE
WE CAN PRODUCE UH SUCH REMOTE CONTROL FOR ABOUT UH FOUR DOLLARS
YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S EMBED IN THE UH SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM
SO
SO NORMAN WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU
YEAH YEAH OF COURSE MM
THANK THANK YOU
AND SO MM-HMM
ALRIGHT PLEASE UH GO ON NORMAN WITH THE SPECIAL FEATURES
YOU ALSO HAVE THE THE THE TWO OTHER MODULES FOR THE PARENTAL CONTROL
THAT THAT YOU CA YOU CAN ADD UP TO THE TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL I I IF YOU UH IF YOU WANT TO TO HAVE MORE MORE POWER ON WHAT YOU DO
AND UH WHICH CHANNEL YOU WANT TO CHOOSE AND SO ON
H HERE IS JUST THE THE THE MODULE FOR THE KIDS AND TH IF THE PARENTS WANT TO WATCH T. V.
UP THEY COME UP WITH THEIR MODULES THEY JUST PLUG IN IT AND THEY CAN HAVE ALL THE CONTROL THEY WANT HERE
WE ALSO HAVE THIS MODULE FOR UH OLD PEOPLE WITH BIG BUTTONS
CLEARLY LABELLED AND IT ACTS LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONE YOU JUST PLUG IN AND IT WORKS
THE TITANIUM AND SO IT'S VERY UH
WELL SO THE PRICE TO PRODUCE
FOR UH THE SIMPLEST ONE SAY WE START FROM FOUR DOLLARS TO PRODUCE SUCH A DEVICE
UH IT'S ABOUT IT
THE WITHOUT WITHOUT THE CHARGER IT'S ABOUT UH WELL TWO DOLLARS TO PRODUCE UH THE MICROPHONE AND SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS
TWO DOLLARS FOR THE UH FOR THE ADD ON MODULES AND FINALLY THREE DOLLARS FOR THE CHARGER
SO IF YOU UH SUM UP UH EVERYTHING
WI WITH THE L. C. D. WHICH COSTS TWO DOLLAR YOU HAVE TWO PLUS FOUR PLUS FOUR PLUS TWO PLUS TWO
IT'S ABOUT SO THE TOTAL COST IF YOU IF YOU WANT ALL THE FUCT FUNCTIONALITIES WILL BE ABOUT UH FIFTEEN DOLLARS
BUT IT'S JUST IF YOU WANT ALL FUNCTIONALITIES
EXCUSE ME
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT THE TECHNICAL IN INNOVATION IS IS IN THE PRODUCT ITSELF SINCE WE HAVEN'T YET A REMOTE WHO ARE ALLOWING TO TO CHOOSE INTERACTIVELY WITH THE T. V. SCREEN UH UH WITH JUST FOUR BUTTONS
OKAY
A SPONGE
HMM
YEAH
WELL IT DOESN'T LOOK MUCH FANCY I'LL I'LL SAY THREE OR FOUR
YEAH
IT'S IT IT
TECHNICAL ASPECTS
YEAH A THREE
UH FOUR
I THINK IT'S IT'S UH MORE EASY TO MAKE F FANCY THINGS WHEN IT'S NOT COMPLICATED SO
REMOVING THE L. C. D. UM GIVES US A LI MORE LIBERTY TO TO HAVE A FANCY LOOK
WELL IT'S IT'S THE SAME FOR BOTH SO I WILL GIVE A FIVE SIX
WELL FIVE ALSO UH NORMAN PLEASE
WITH LOT OF FUNCTIONALITIES
MM FOR BOTH IT'S THE THE SAME INNOVATIONS
SIX LET'S GO FOR SIX
YEAH
TALK ABOUT
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE THE SAME PROGRAMME ON THE T. V. SCREEN
IF YOU HAVE THE L. C. D. BUT IF N
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK BOTH ARE REALLY EASY TO USE BECAUSE THERE ARE FEW BUTTON BUTTONS AND UH WELL T P THE MENU ARE CLEAR WELL ORGANISED SO
WELL WITH LITTLE KNOWING OF THE TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN YOU CAN EASILY USE THE PRODUCT SO I WILL GIVE A SIX FOR THE EASY TO USE
YEAH IT'S CHEAPER TO PRODUCE
AND UH IF THE THE WELL IF WE HAVE LESS TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE MORE LIBERTY TO UH FOR THE SHAPE AND UH THINGS LIKE THAT SO
YEP
YEAH
SIX
UM SIX
YES AS YOU SAY WITH BETTER UH YEAH
AND TO IMPROVE THE THE LOOK
YES AND TO GIVE US MORE LIBERTY TO HAVE A FANCY LOOK SO
SO LET'S GO BACK TO OUR LABORATORY AND
YEAH
IT'S OPTIONAL YEAH SINCE WELL ACCORDING TO THIS STUDY UH PEOPLE MORE LIKES MORE TO HAVE A SPONGY UH REMOTE CONTROL THAN
YEAH
WELL IT'S ABOUT THE SAME BECAUSE IF
WELL YOU CAN IF YOU HAD UH SOMETHING LI
OH NO BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU ADD UH SOMETHING WELL YEAH MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S THREE DIFFERENT PIECES UH TO TO TO BUILD BUT
YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S I THINK IT'S CHEAPER IF YOU IF YOU ALREADY BUILT THE ALL THE FUNCTIONALITIES UM ON THE SAME MODULE BUT UH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL SO
YEAH YEAH I THINK WE ARE YEAH BUT WE ARE ALSO THE UM WELL THE COMPONENTS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE BECAUSE UH WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SHAPE AND UM BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL UH INCREASE THE COST TOO MUCH SO
UH WELL BUT IT'S A BIT COMPLICATED TO IF IF IF YOU NEED MACHINES TO DIFFERENT MACHINES TO UM AH WELL
YEAH YEAH WE CAN HAVE THE SAME GLOBAL SHAPE AND THEN UH ADD ON SKINS AND WITH WITH THIS UH TEX SPONGY TEXTURE UH THINGS LIKE THAT
SPONGE
OKAY
SO WE FINISHED THE PROTOTYPE UH PRESENTATION IF YOU HAVE UH SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY
THAT WAS GOOD
YEAH
FINE YES UH
VERY DEMOCRATIC
THANK YOU
ALRIGHT
COME UP WITH NEW PRODUCT
YEAH AND ALSO MORE WELL UH MORE SERIOUSLY I THINK IT'S IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE UH CLEAR CLEAR POINTS WHENEVER WE DO A MEETING UH PRIOR TO THE MEETING TO HAVE UH WELL A LIST WITH THE POINTS WHO WILL BE DISCUSSED OR THINGS LIKE THAT
BUT
I THINK IT'S ALRIGHT
WE ACHIEVED UH PROJECT GOAL I THINK
IT'S W YES MORE OR LESS
YEAH BUT
ALRIGHT
SO
SO UH COFFEE MACHINE
OKAY
IS IT AN ONLY A SINGLE MIC OR A MICROPHONE ARRAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
THE COST WOULD BE LE REDUCED
IS THAT TWO OR ONE
NOW WHAT IS THE WHOLE DAY RATING FOR THAT
WHOLE DAY'S RATING
WHAT TYPE OF BATTERY
SOMETHING LIKE A TWO A. A. THREE SIZE BATTERIES
MM-HMM
AND THE L. C. D. IS THIS ONE ON THE REMOTE
YEAH
UH-HUH AND ALSO THE SWITCH
OKAY
MM-HMM
AND I THINK YOU FORGOT A POINT HERE TO HAVE AN BUTTON TO FIND THE CHARGER BECAUSE THAT'S A MAJOR THAT'S A
OKAY AND IF YOU DISABLE SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM THEN
MM-HMM HMM-HMM HMM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE BUT THE COMPANY IS NOT WILLING TO INVEST MORE AT THE MOMENT
OR UH
SOMETHING LIKE CUSTOMISED
YEAH
MM-HMM HMM-HMM
HMM OKAY
AND THIS IS OTHER ONE
MM-HMM HMM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH THAT'S FINE
OKAY
MM-HMM HMM-HMM
WITH THE CHARGER
I THINK WE CAN USE EXCEL
YEAH IT'S A NICE INPUT BUT WE HAVE AN
OTHER INPUTS FROM THE L PUBLIC DEMANDS
I THINK WE WILL JUST HAVE A ROUGH LOOK AND THEN WE CAN MAKE OUR STATEMENTS AND WE CAN FINALISE THE PRODUCT BASED ON THIS DISCU
I THINK WE CAN JUST GO TO MY PRESENTATION THEN
WE CAN WIND UP
OR WE COULD UH COME TO SOME F UH FINAL CONCLUSIONS
SO THE MARKETING MADE AN EVALUATION CRITERIA AND THESE WERE SOME OF THE FINDINGS AND UH
IN THE MARKET THE PEOPLE ARE NOT REALLY INTERESTED WITH L. C. D. WITHOUT L. C. D. WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION INTERFACE OR WITHOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION INTERFACE
BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IS FIRST THING IS THEY WANT TO HAVE AN FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
IT SHOULD BE VERY FANCY WITH COLOURFUL AND UH VERY HANDY TO HOLD
AND THE SECOND THING IS IT SHOULD BE MUCH MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
OF COURSE IN THAT WE COULD PUT L. C. D. OR RECOGNITION TO BE MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
AND THE THIRD ONE IS EASY TO USE
OKAY AND IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE HERE YOU CAN FIND THESE ARE THE LATEST FASHION UPDATES
AND SO THIS IN PARIS AND MILAN THEY HAVE DETECTED THIS TRENDS THAT THE THIS YEAR IT'S GOING TO BE AN YEAR OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
SO PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE IF THEY HAVE AN REMOTE IN THE SHAPE OF THE FRUIT OR A VEGETABLE OR WHATEVER THEY LIKE
SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE MUCH MORE CUSTOMISED TO MAKE A DIFFERENT UH SHAPES
AND THE SECOND THING IS AND IF THE MATERIAL THEY REALLY DO NOT WANT IT TO BE VERY HARD
AS IN THE CASE OF VERY PL PLASTIC OR TITANIUM IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT SPONGY
UM
YEAH SO UH SO FINALLY WE HAVE THESE THREE CRITERIAS
ONE IS FANCY LOOK SECOND IS
INNOVATIVE AND THIRD IS EASY TO USE
SO THESE ARE THE F UH THREE CRITERIA ON WHICH WE ARE GOING TO BUILD OUR REMOTE
SO AND WE HAVE AN EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR EACH ONE OF THESE SAY THAT WE HAVE A SEVEN POINT SCALE
FROM ONE TO SEVEN AND FOR EACH OF THE PRODUCT YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME THE SCALE ACCORDING TO THIS
SO NOW YOU HAVE WITH L. C. D. AND WITHOUT L. C. D. SO ON THIS SCALE IF IT IS TRUE
IF IT IS IF IT HAS A FANCY LOOK YOU COULD JUST TELL ME ONE OR IF IT IS FALSE
IT DOESN'T IT LOOKS UH IT DOESN'T LOOK MUCH FANCY THEN YOU COULD JUST TELL ME SEVEN
SO
WE CAN MAKE OUR STUDY ON THIS AND
NO NO WE HAVE YOU HAVE DESIGNED TWO PRODUCTS NOW ONE IS WITH L. C. D. AND WITHOUT L. C. D.
ACCORDING TO YOU NO ACCORDING TO YOU DESIGNERS HOW WILL FEEL DOES IT UH WITH L. C. D. AND WITHOUT L. C. D.
OKAY LET US MAKE THIS L. AND WITHOUT L. C. D.
ON ON THIS SCALE THE L. C. D. REMOTE CONTROL
HOW DO YOU LOOK HOW DOES IT LOOK
D IS IT VERY FANCY OR DOESN'T LOOK MUCH FANCY
AND YOU BOTH AGREE FOR THAT
SO I TAKE THREE ON WITH L. C. D.
SO WITHOUT L. C. D. HOW WOULD YOU RATE IT
FOUR
AND IN THE SENSE OF INNOVATIVENESS WITH L. C. D.
FIVE WITH L. C. D. AND
SO WITHOUT L. C. D.
NO NO ACCORDING TO DESIGN ASPECT WE WANT TO KNOW HOW WOULD YOU FEEL THE INNOVATIVENESS
WITH L. C. D.
AND WITHOUT L. C. D.
OKAY
NO ACTUALLY UH TO MAKE IT WITH L. C. D. YOU MAKE MORE EFFORTS
SO I THERE IS HIGH INNOVATIVENESS INCLUDED IF YOU MAKE IT WITH L. C. D. Y THEN WHEN IT IS WITHOUT L. C. D. THERE IS NOT MUCH INNOVATIVENESS
SO WE CAN'T GO
I MEAN THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYIN THAT'S WHAT THE DESIGN
NO IT'S LIKE THIS I MEAN ON THE L. C. D. ACCORDING TO WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR MODEL IS YOU HAVE A JOYSTICK HERE
AND YOU HAVE L. C. D. YOU JUST PRESS YOUR JOYSTICK YOU GET HERE A PROGRAMME
UH THEN
NO ON THE T. V. YOU DON'T IT DOESN'T DISPLAY ON THE T. V. NOW
L. C. D.
THEN UH THERE IS NO MEANING IN HAVING IT ON THE T. V.
OR THEN AGAIN YOU HAVE A CHANNELS VOLUME AND ALL THE STUFF AND WHAT A
I MEAN THAT DEPENDS UPON YOUR DESIGN SO
I MEAN
SO WITHOUT L. C. D. YOU WANT TO PUT IT FI THE SAME LEVEL OF INNOVATIVENESS
AND WHICH DO YOU RECOMMEND E EASY TO USE WITH L. C. D. OR WITHOUT L. C. D.
YEAH
OR WE CAN JUST GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS SLIDE UH WHERE WE HA WE HAVE A FEW UPDATES
SO I MEAN IN THE PRODUCT DESIGN YOU COULD JUST AMEND IT TO MAKE SOME FEW CHANGES ACCORDING TO FRUIT AND VEGETABLE OR A SPONGY TOUCH WITHOUT L. C. D. AND WITHOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION
EVEN THEN OUR PRODUCT IS GOING TO BE VERY GOOD
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
SO WITHOUT L. C. D. I JUST TAKE IT FIVE
OR YOU WANT IT TO BE SIX
S S OH I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE THIS WITHOUT L. C. D.
AS OUR PROGRAMME MANAGER S PRO PROJECT MANAGER SAYS THAT WITHOUT L. C. D. IT IS GOING TO REDUCE THE COST ALSO AND IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH SIMPLER TO USE
SO
THAT'S GOING TO BE AN OPTIONAL
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO BUY IT THEY CAN HAVE IT OTHERWISE NO
IT'S AN OPTIONAL
YEAH
YEAH BUT I MEAN IF YOU HAVE AN ADD ONS THE KIDS MAY JUST UH HIDE THE PARENTAL MODULE AND SO THAT THEIR PARENTS CAN'T USE IT
IN THE SAME SET YEAH AND AND INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS TO MAKE THEM WORK
I MEAN HOW TO HOW TO HOW TO MAKE A MARKETING SURVEY THAT UH HOW MANY MARRIED COUPLE OR HOW MANY COUPLES HAVE A T. V. OR TO THE NUMBER OR SINGLES WHO HAVE A TELEVISION
SO BASED ON THAT I THINK
BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT ON A SINGLE P. C. WITH THREE DIFFERENT OPTIONS
ON THE SAME P. C. B. YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
I MEAN YOU COULD JUST PROVIDE WITH AN OPTIONAL
SO IT'S SOMETHING LIKE A MICROSOFT PRODUCT UPDATE
UPDATES AND WE SELL IT
WE MAKE UPDATES AND SELL IT
AND UH WHAT'S THE IDEA ABOUT UH THE SHAPE OF THE REMOTE CONTROLS
UH CAN THEY BE MADE INTO A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE TYPES
DO YOU REQUIRE DIFFERENT TYPES OF P. C. B. S AND
OR UH IT COULD BE LIKE THIS THE P. C. B. WOULD BE THE SAME FOR ALL BUT ONLY THE EXTERIOR UH SHAPE IS DIFFERENT O FOR ALL
YEAH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK INTO THE MATERIAL
YEAH YEAH
I THINK THE PROJECT MANAGER WOULD BE INTERESTED TO LOOK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL ISSUES IN MAKING THESE MODELS
I FEEL IT'S FINE WE KNOW WE DON'T NEED UH I THINK IT'S OKAY
THIS IS FINE FOR MAKING A PRESENTAT FOR PROJECT PRESENTATIONS
AND THE LEADERSHIP WAS EXCELLENT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
AND NEW IDEAS FOUND
ANY NEW IDEAS TO MAKE THESE PRESENTATIONS MORE INTERACTIVE AND MORE INTERESTING
I MEAN UH WHAT TYPE OF PRODUCT WOULD YOU THINK COULD WE MAKE THIS MORE INTERESTING
YEAH THAT IS WITHIN THE BUDGET
AND THE EVALUATION WAS
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
AND THE NEXT IS CELEBRATION
SO
YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH
