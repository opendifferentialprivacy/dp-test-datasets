YEAH BUSY JOB
GOOD MORNING
SO
OH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE
I'D UH LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TO OUR FIRST MEETING
I'VE PREPARED A LITTLE PRESENTATION
MY NAME IS AND UH I HOPE YOU WILL INTRODUCE YOURSELF UH IN A FEW MINUTES AS WILL I
UM I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER OF THIS PROJECT AND UH WELL I WILL TELL YOU ON WHAT ACTUALLY IS THE PROJECT
THIS IS UH THE AGENDA FOR OUR FIRST MEETING
UM THIS IS THE OPENING THEN WE WILL GET I WILL HOPE WE WILL GET ACQUAINTED TO EACH OTHER
WE'LL DO A LITTLE TOOL TRAINING WITH THESE TWO THINGS
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROJECT PLAN
UH THERE WILL BE TIME FOR DISCUSSION
ACTUALLY WE HAVE TO DISCUSS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CREATE A PRODUCT
AND THEN WE WILL CLOSE THIS SESSION
UM BUT FIRST OF ALL WE I'D LIKE TO UH INTRODUCE YOU TO THIS ROOM
UM AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED THERE ARE LITTLE BLACK UH FIELDS ON THE TABLE
UM YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR LAPTOP EXACTLY IN THAT FIELD SO THE LITTLE CAMERAS CAN SEE YOUR FACE
UM THERE ARE CAMERAS
EVERYWHERE AROUND THE ROOM ESPECIALLY HERE FOR YOUR FACE OF COURSE AND THIS ISN'T A PIE
IT'S A A SET OF MICROPHONES AND THERE ARE MICROPHONES HERE ALSO
BUT PLEASE UH DON'T BE AFRAID OF THEM
THEY WON'T HURT YOU
UM WELL UH I SAID I'M THE PROJECT MANAGER AND UH I'M HOPING UH FOR A GOOD PROJECT AND UH I'D LIKE TO HEAR UH WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR FUNCTIONS ARE UH ON THIS PROJECT
LET'S START WITH THE LADIES
OKAY SO I
OKAY WELL WE HAVE SOME EXPERTISE FROM UH DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE OF THE COMPANY
THAT'S GOOD
UM WELL I SAID UH WE'RE WORKING ON A PROJECT AND THE AIM FOR THE PROJECT IS TO TO CREATE A TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL WHICH UH HAS TO BE ORIGINAL
TRENDY AND OF COURSE USER FRIENDLY
AND UH I HOPE WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO CREATE SUCH A PROJECT SUCH A PRODUCT
UM THE WAY WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE THAT IS UH THE FOLLOWING METHODS
IT CONSISTS OF THREE PHASES NAMELY THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND DETAILED DESIGN
AS YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THESE PHASES CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS NAMELY INDIVIDUAL WORK PART AND A MEETING WHERE WE WILL DISCUSS UH OUR WORK SO FAR
OKAY
BUT FIRST I WILL UH TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE TOOLS WE HAVE HERE
I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES BUT THEY ARE NOT OF UH MUCH USE TO US
UH
WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE TWO THINGS
THEY ARE SMART BOARDS
AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN GIVE A PRESENTATION ON THEM
AND UH THIS ONE HERE IS A WHITE BOARD
I WILL UH INSTRUCT YOU ABOUT THAT SOON
UM AS YOU ALSO NOTICED UH THIS PRESENTATION DOCUMENT IS IN OUR UH PROJECT FOLDER AND EVERY DOCUMENT YOU PUT IN THIS FOLDER UH IS UH IT IS POSSIBLE TO SHOW THAT HERE IN OUR MEETING ROOM
UM AND YEAH THERE ARE AVAILABLE ON BOTH SMART BOARDS BUT I THINK WE WILL UH MAINLY USE THIS ONE FOR THE DOCUMENTS IN THE SHARED FOLDER
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE SAME TOOL BAR UH AS IS LOCATED HERE
UM THE MOST FUNCTIONS UH WE WILL USE WILL BE TO TO ADD A NEW PAGE
UM UH TO GO BACK AND FORWARD BETWEEN PAGES AND OF COURSE UH TO SAVE IT EVERY NOW AND THEN
UM AND THIS IS THE PEN WITH WHICH YOU CAN DRAW ON THE BOARD FOR INSTANCE
LIKE THIS IF EVERYTHING'S OKAY BUT I FIRST HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE PEN YOU SEE I'M NEW TO IT TOO
UM AND THEN YOU CAN WRITE THINGS LIKE TEST OR WHATEVER YOU WANT
AS YOU CAN SEE YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT A LITTLE BIT SLOW IT'S NOT SUCH A FAST BOARD IT'S A SMART BOARD BUT ALSO A SLOW BOARD
UH BUT YOU CAN WRITE THINGS AND OF COURSE YOU CAN ALSO WHEN YOU CLICK HERE UH ERASE THINGS SO WE HAVE UH EST LEFT
AND UM YOU CAN ALSO DELETE AN ENTIRE PAGE BUT WE ASK YOU NOT TO DO THAT
JUST SIMPLY CREATE A NEW ONE AND UH START ALL OVER BECAUSE WE WANT TO SAVE ALL THE RESULTS
UM DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THIS
NICE APPLICATION
WELL YOU CAN ERASE IT WITH THE ERASER BUT UH YOU SHOULDN'T DELETE AN ENTIRE PAGE BUT JUST CREATE A NEW BLANK ONE
I WILL DELETE THIS ONE NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T USE IT YET
BUT YOU CAN OF COURSE ERASE WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE BUT DON'T UH DELETE ENTIRE PAGES
AND YOU CAN ALSO UM LET'S SEE I THINK IT'S HERE UH CHANGE THE UH COLOUR OF YOUR PEN
FOR INSTANCE TAKE A BLUE ONE AND UH CHANGE THE LINE WIDTH LIKE TO FIVE
UM THAT'S WHAT YOU WILL NEED FOR OUR FIRST EXERCISE BECAUSE I'M UH GOING TO ASK YOU TO DRAW YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL
IT'S ALSO TO GETS TO KNOW EACH OTHER BECAUSE UM I'M ASKING THREE THINGS UH FOR THAT UH DRAWING TO DO IT ON A BLANK SHEET
WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS AND I JUST SHOWED YOU HOW TO PICK A COLOUR AND ALSO WITH DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS WHICH I ALSO SHOWED YOU
UM AND A FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTIC CAN BE JUST UH ONE WORD
WELL I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT DRAWING BUT I WILL UH GO FIRST
AND UM TRY TO DRAW
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD GUESS WHAT I'M DRAWING EH
WELL IT UH
COULD BE EVERYTHING
MAYBE WHEN I PUT ON
THIS THING
IT COULD BE A TURTLE OR A SNAIL AND
BUT A TURTLE HAS
AND THOSE ARE SLOW
AND I HOPE OUR PROJECT GROUP WILL NOT BE SLOW BUT WE WILL UH WORK TO A GOOD RESULT AND DO IT UH AS FAST AS WE CAN
OKAY TIME FOR ANOTHER ANIMAL
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO NEXT
MM-HMM
OKAY
COULD YOU WRITE THE WORDS UH UNDERNEATH IT
OR MORE WORDS
LITTLE RABBITS
OKAY THANK YOU
AND OUR FINAL DRAWING
MM-HMM
OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I CAN SEE WE HAVE SOME UH DRAWING TALENT UH IN THIS GROUP HUH
WELL NICE ANIMALS NICE WORDS
SOUNDS GOOD
UM BACK TO BUSINESS BACK TO THE MONEY PART
UM FROM THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT I HAVE LEARNED THAT WE ARE AIMING FOR A SELLING PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE EUROS
AND WE'RE HOPING FOR A AIM OF FIFTY MILLION EUROS AND UH WE ARE HOPING TO ACHIEVE THAT UH BY AIMING FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET
AND THE PRODUCTION COST WILL BE TWELVE EURO FIFTY MAX
OKAY WELL IT'S TIME UH FOR SOME DISCUSSION
I'VE WROTE DOWN SOME EXAMPLES HERE OF WHAT WE CAN CAN SPEAK ABOUT
UH WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROLS UM WHAT KIND OF IDEAS DO YOU HAVE TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
MAYBE FOR WHICH MARKET SEGMENTS SHOULD WE AIM OR SHOULD WE AIM FOR ALL SEGMENTS
UH WELL ACTUALLY I'D LIKE TO HAND THE WORD UH BACK TO YOU
WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
BORING IT'S NOT FUN TO USE A REMOTE
MM-HMM
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE IT FUN
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
SO MAYBE A A MINIMALIST DESIGN THE LEAST UH POSSIBLE AMOUNT UH OF BUTTONS
MM-HMM
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BOTHER PEOPLE WITH UH LOADS OF BUTTONS
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY NEED MANY BUTTONS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF THEIR SEAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY WELL ANY MORE IDEAS
NO
OKAY YEAH WELL WE HAVE SOME TIME
LET'S SEE WHAT MORE I HAVE TO TELL YOU
I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH LEFT

IS IT MY LAPTOP
YEP
AH WELL THAT'S GOOD FIVE MINUTES AND UH THE MEETING'S OVER UH RIGHT ON SCHEDULE
UM THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL UH WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE USER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER WILL WORK OUT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
AND THIS WAS THE INTERFACE DESIGNER
OR THE INTERACTION DESIGNER
OR WHAT WAS IT I. D.
INTERFACE DESIGNER OKAY FIRST GUESS WAS RIGHT
UH WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE THE WORKING DESIGN
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER OKAY SORRY
LET'S JUST USE THE ACRONYMS
UM AND OF COURSE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS UH WILL BE SENT TO YOU UH THROUGH YOUR PERSONAL COACH
UH WELL THOSE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE UH IN THE EMAIL YOU WILL RECEIVE UH SHORTLY I HOPE
AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN UH EXPERTISE

THANK YOU VERY MUCH
GOOD MORNING
WELL
WELL UH I'M UH AND MY UH FUNCTION IS USER INTERFACE DESIGN
I THINK
SO UH THAT'S ME
ME TOO
OH
SO WE CAN'T ERASE ANYTHING
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
IT'S A SHEEP
A BEAVER
IT'S WEIRD
IT HAS WINGS
WELL THE SNAIL DOESN'T HAVE LEGS
OH RIGHT
WELL
IT'S A GIRAFFE
OR A DINOSAUR
YES
GIRAFFE
SHOULD I UH
ALRIGHT
SO I CAN DRAW BUT UH
UH
WELL
OH
OH WRONG ONE
UH
WELL UH YOU CAN GUESS WHAT IT IS I HOPE
IT'S A RABBIT
AND UH WELL UH IT'S UH QUICK I GUESS
THAT'S UH MY UH FAVOURITE ANIMAL
A DOLPHIN
RIGHT
WELL
WITH AN E.
YOU CAN TRY OUT THE ERASER NOW
NOT REALLY
I ALWAYS LOSE THEM
YES
YEAH
YEAH
SEARCH FOR THE BUTTONS WHICH ONE IS WHICH AND UH
WELL
PERHAPS THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROAD REMOTES R ROAD CON REMOTE CONTROLS
YES PERHAPS YOU CAN INTEGRATE THEM OR SOMETHING
YES
YOUR STEREO AND YOUR T. V. AND UH
PERHAPS THAT'S AN IDEA
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
AND WHICH YOU DON'T USE
RIGHT
YEAH
YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE IT TO
CHANGING CHANNEL
YES
BUT YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE EVERY BUTTON THEY NEED ON IT
BECAUSE UH THINGS FOR UH TELETEXT I DUNNO UH W WHAT'S THE NAME
YEAH
BUT
BUT IF IF IT'S IF IT'S INTERNATIONAL YOU SHOULD UH LOOK IN THINK IN BRITAIN THEY HAVE UH DIFFERENT THINGS THEY CAN DO WITH THE T. V.
OR SO UH THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE
I DUNNO IF YOU SHOULD UH TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION OR THAT YOU JUST SHOULD AIM FOR THE NORMAL T. V. S THAT UH
AND THE B. B. C.
YES
YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF THE THEY HAVE THAT ANYWHERE ELSE THOUGH
YEAH WE CAN LEAVE THAT
YEAH
WELL BUT BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO TO FIND YOUR OTHER REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU WANT TO SEARCH
THAT'S NOT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S UH
WELL NOT EVERYWHERE
YEAH YOU CAN CHOOSE THE CODE
YEAH
BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE A NEW TELEVISION AND C IF YOU LOOK INTO THE FUTURE THEN THEY WANT WILL WANT THE BUTTON IF THEIR THING IS BROKE
YEAH
GUESS NOT
YEAH MEETING WILL CLOSE IN FIVE MINUTES
HMM-HMM
NO INTERFACE
NO THE YEAH
SO
SO I SHOULD LOOK AT UH WHAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO WITH THE REMOTE OR UH OR HOW I DON'T REALLY
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
ME TOO
ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
GOOD MORNING
OKAY UH I'M UH I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND I UH HOPE TO UH LOOK FORWARD TO UH A VERY UH PLEASING UH END OF THIS UH PROJECT
YEAH
OKAY
HMM
SEAL A SEAL
A BE
MM
WITH A TAIL AND A MOUTH
SNAIL
OKAY
SURE
THE HELL
MAKE THAT CUTE
TALL
B
BUNNY RABBIT
OKAY
OKAY UM
UH I UH DRAW I I'VE DRAWN A DOLPHIN BECAUSE OF ITS INTELLIGENCE
ONE OF THE MOST INTELLIGENT UH
ANIMALS IN OUR WORLD
YEAH INTELLIGENT
I'VE I'VE UH ERASER
PEN
WELL NOT PERFECT BUT OKAY
A LOT OF BUTTONS
AND YOU ALWAYS LOSE THEM
A LOT OF BUTTONS WHICH YOU DON'T USE OR WHO YOU DON'T USE COMPLEX
NOT USER FRIENDLY
MM
BLACK COLOURS
THEY USE BATTERIES AND BATTERIES UH AND POOR SIGNAL
UH
YEAH DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS YEAH
UH FOR THE USE OF DIFFERENT UH DEVICES
YEAH BUT YOU COULD UH I THIN UH THERE'S A POSSIBILITY TO G UH TO UH
TO PUT THOSE BUTTONS UH BEHIND SOME UH KIND OF UH PROTECTION SO THAT IF Y Y YOU ONLY GET TO SEE THEM WHEN YOU NEED 'EM
THAT'S POSSIBLE SO THAT YOU ONLY GET THE NO N N NO
JUST UH FOR EXAMPLE YOU GOT TH UH THE SAME SIZE UH REMOTE CONTROL YOU USE EVERYDAY
BUT UM THE USUAL BUTTONS SUCH AS UH UM ZAPPING UH AS YOU CALL IT IN DUTCH
UH AND THE VOLUME CONTROL UH ARE ONLY THE ONLY POSSIBLE BUTTONS UH TO USE DIRECTLY
OR UH THE NUMBERS OF COURSE
BUT UH NOT UH THE BUTTONS USED TO SEARCH ON THE THE CHANNELS ON YOUR TELEVISION
YOU ONLY USE THOSE UH THE FIRST TIME OR
SO
UH
YEAH I THINK SO YEAH
YEAH UH TELETEXT
THINK SO
OKAY
RIGHT
UH
YEAH I I UNDERSTAND
NO
YEAH
WHEN I THINK OF IT UH I THINK THE MAIN IDEA UH OF THIS REMOTE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH
TO MAKE IT USER FRIENDLY
SO UH I THINK UH WHEN P UH WHEN UH THE CUSTOMERS WILL BUY THIS REMOTE CONTROL
THEY ALREADY HAVE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH UH COMPANIES UH UH WITH UH THE THE STANDARDS UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH WHICH COMES UH WITH THE TELEVISION
SO UH IT ONLY HAS TO HAVE UH THE MOST USED BUTTONS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO INTEGRATE THE BUTTONS TO SEARCH THE CHANNELS ON YOUR TELEVISION
IN THOSE IN THAT
YEAH BUT I BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UH TO ACCOMMODATE UH ACCOMMODATE UH ALL THE BUTTONS ON THE S ON THE DIFFERENCE DIFFERENT TELEVISIONS SETS ON ONE REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
BECAUSE UH FOR EXAMPLE SONY TELEVISION UH HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO S TO MAKE UH UH TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR TO SEE ON ONE SIDE OF THE SCREEN UH TELETEXT
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE UH JUST N UH REGULAR TELEVISION
UH
YEAH BUT UH THEY DON'T USE THE SAME SIGNAL UH ON REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE A PANASONIC UH REMOTE CONTROL ON A ON A PHILIPS TELEVISION
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
BUT UH I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE UH TH UH WILL BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE BECAUSE UH THE FIRST THEY LOST THE ONE THEY LOST FIRST ONE OR THE FIRST ONE IS BROKEN
SO UH UH PERHAPS THEY HAVE A GOT A AN OLDER TELEVISION SO THAT OPTION IS NOT UH OPTIONAL FOR THOSE UH PEOPLE
YEAH YEAH
SO WE SHOULD TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION
OH MM NO
THINGS'LL COME UP
STOP THE MEETING NOW
OKAY
MM
NO
NO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORKING DESIGN AND THE IN UH USABILITY INTERACTION YEAH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
NO
OKAY
OH
NO PROBLEM
OKAY
ALRIGHTY
OKAY
MY NAME'S
I'M UH MARKETING EXPERT
MY JOB IS IN THE COMPANY TO PROMOTE COMPANY OR PROMOTE PRODUCTS TO THE CUSTOMERS

NO
DINOS DINOSAUR
BEAVER
TURTLE
NO PROBLEM
NO PROBLEM
MM
IT WAS FOUR MONTHS
NICE OKAY
TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER
NO IT'S A GIRAFFE
'KAY
I THINK IT'S
EASY TO R UH TO
RECOGNISE AS A GIRAFFE
YEAH THE FAVOURITE CHARIS CHARACTERISTIC IS THAT THE LONG NECK IT CAN REACH EVERYTHING
AND I HOPE I CAN ALSO REACH A LOT WITH THIS PROJECT
SO THAT'S MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW
OH UH
TALL
SO 'KAY
IT'S A MOUSE
A BUNNY RABBIT
UH-HUH
NO PROBLEM
BOB ROSS
DOLPHIN
YEAH
COMPLEX
NO
NO
BORING
NO
BLACK ALL BLACK
SO YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
THE THE ANGLE YOU HAVE TO USE
YOU HAD DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROLS FOR DIFFERENT DEVICES
YES
YEAH
YEAH BUT THEN AGAIN YOU YOU STILL HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS SO
FLAP YEAH
YEAH OKAY THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT'LL GET VERY BIG THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NUMBERS
ON AND OFF
YEAH PLAY PAUSE STOP
MM-HMM OF COURSE
NO
YEAH
BECAUSE I THINK A MARKET WILL BE ALL KIND OF PEOPLE
ELDERLY P EL ELDERLY YOUNG PEOPLE SO
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE BETTER ONE BECAUSE
I THINK IF YOU YOU'RE GOING TO TARGET A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THE WHOLE WORLD AND ONLY BRITAIN THEN I THINK THE COST WILL UH RISE HIGHER THAN THE TWELVE FIFTY
I THINK
I THINK THE AIM IS BETTER TO USE UH THE WHOLE WORLD AND BRITAIN YEAH
NOT THAT MUCH
MM
STANDARD DELIVER
MM
NO BUT
YEAH
YEAH TH IT IT'S I THINK THAT'S NOT
YEAH OKAY
NO
I THINK N M N MOST TELEVISIONS NOWADAYS DO THIS
SO I THINK NUMERALS
YEAH BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE THIS ALWAYS WITH R UNIVERSAL REMOTES YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE CODE
YOU CAN USE WHICH WHICH TYPE OF TELEVISION YOU HAVE
THAT'S NO PROBLEM
BUT I THINK LIKE THE TWO PAGES ON THE SAME SCREEN LIKE TELETEXT AND NORMAL TELEVISION THAT'S THAT'S NOWADAYS STANDARD I THINK
SIMPLICITY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH G AVAILABLE
TRUE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OF COURSE
YEAH
YEAH
INTERFACE
UH-HUH
NO
I HAVE ONE QUESTION
WHERE DOES IT SAYS WE HAVE TO MAKE A REMOTE BECAUSE I PRESUMED
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO
OKAY NO NO PROBLEM
NO PROBLEM
YEAH
MM-HMM
GOOD MORNING AGAIN
ALL SET
GOOD
OKAY
LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND HERE
OKAY
A VERY WARM WELCOME AGAIN TO EVERYONE
UM HERE WE ARE ALREADY AT OUR UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING
UM AND THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
THE OPENING WHICH WE ARE DOING NOW UM AND THE SPECIAL NOTE I'M PROJECT MANAGER BUT ON THE MEETINGS I'M ALSO THE SECRETARY
WHICH MEANS I WILL MAKE UH MINUTES AS I DID OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING
AND UH I ALSO PUT THESE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IN THE UH PROJECT FOLDER SO YOU CAN SEE THEM AND REVIEW WHAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED
UM IF I'M RIGHT THERE ARE THREE PRESENTATIONS I GUESS EACH ONE OF YOU HAS PREPARED ONE
GOOD
AND UM WE WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS UM IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THEM YET
AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE TO TAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS AND WE HAVE SOME MORE TIME FORTY MINUTES
BUT I THINK WE WILL NEED IT
UM WELL I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST WITH HIS PRESENTATION
YOU CAN GO FIRST OKAY
IS THERE AN ORDER
I HAVEN'T
AND ONE QUESTION UH YOUR NAME DENNI IS IT WITH A
I. E. E. I. E. OKAY
THANK YOU
SORRY
YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BUG IT'S IN THE IN THE SMART BOARD
OKAY THANK YOU
YEP
PLEASE
OKAY THANK YOU
OKAY THANK YOU
UM WELL THANK YOU ALL HUH
I DUNNO UH DID EVERYONE RECEIVE AN EMAIL WITH UH THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
NO
WELL
THEN I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING THAT I MADE A SEPARATE SLIDE OF THEM SO YOU CAN
ALL READ THEM
OH WELL NOT IN THIS PRESENTATION
HMM
SHOULD BE IN THERE
WELL I CAN TELL YOU THEM UH FROM MY LAPTOP
UM TELETEXT DOES HAS BECOME OUTDATED SINCE THE POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET
SO THAT'S UH THE FIRST THING WE I THINK WE SHOULD PAY LESS ATTENTION TO UH TELETEXT
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR THE TELEVISION OTHERWISE THE PROJECT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX
WHICH ENDANGERS THE TIME TO MARKET AND OF COURSE WOULD MAKE IT MORE COSTLY I THINK
UM OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE WITHIN THE AGE GROUP OF FORTY PLUS
AND NEW PRODUCT SHOULD REACH A NEW MARKET WITH CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN FORTY AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE
AND UH A LAST POINT BUT ALSO VERY IMPORTANT OUR CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD STAY RECOGNISABLE IN OUR PRODUCTS
WHICH MEANS THAT OUR UH CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND
UM WELL UH ACCORDING TO OUR AGENDA IT'S THEN TIME TO TAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
SO WHO HAS ANY IDEA ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE ON IT AND WHAT SHOULDN'T
YEAH
ONLY BE USED FOR TELEVISION
WELL IT SAYS ONLY FOR TELEVISION HERE HUH
MAKES IT A LOT EASIER HUH
MM-HMM
UH WELL NEW PRODUCT SHOULD REACH A MARKET WITH CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN FORTY AND NOW WE HAVE CURRENT CUSTOMERS UH OF FORTY PLUS
MM-HMM
SO WE'RE GOING FOR AN L. C. D. SCREEN
AND HOPING THAT WHEN WE PRODUCE A LOT IT WON'T BE TOO EXPENSIVE
MM-HMM
OKAY SO L. C. D. IT IS
OKAY
AND WHAT ELSE
YEAH OKAY
BUT FOR NOW IT'S L. C. D.
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH AND MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE SOMETHING FANCY OUT OF AN L. C. D. REMOTE BECAUSE IT'S NEW AS FAR AS I KNOW
OKAY WHAT ELSE DOES OUR REMOTE NEED
MUTE BUTTON
MM-HMM
YEAH AND WE COULD MAKE AN A A SEPARATE MENU ON THE L. C. D. UH SCREEN FOR TELETEXT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
AND MAYBE A LOW BATTERY INDICATOR
ON THE SCREEN
SO WE ARE GOING FOR THE FOR THE RECHARGER
OKAY
YEAH ALSO
OKAY WELL I'VE
YEAH YOU HAVE SOME MORE
POINTS
AND YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION
EVEN BIGGER THAN FOR L. C. D.
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGES
SPEECH RECOGNITION SCORES EVEN HIGHER HUH
YEAH WELL MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE COST BUT UH NOBODY KNOWS UH HOW MUCH UH IT WILL COST UH
BUT WOULD IT BE USEFUL TO IMPLE IMPLEMENT BOTH
ON ONE REMOTE
OR
YEAH I DUNNO
SO NO SPEECH RECOGNITION
OR
YEAH AND THEN WE HAVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES
OKAY JUST MAKE A SEPARATE REMOTE FOR EACH UH
OKAY SO WE ONLY DO THIS WHEN WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY LEFT
OKAY
WELL I'VE WRITTEN DOWN AN AN ON OR OFF BUTTON VOLUME SELECTION CHANNEL SELECTION UH THE DIGITS FROM ONE TO ZERO HUH
UM OR FROM ZERO TO NINE
UH A DIGITS BUTTON TO SWITCH UH BETWEEN ONE AND TWO DIGITS MUTE BUTTON A SEPARATE MENU FOR TELETEXT A BATTERY INDICATOR
UM WE'RE GOING TO USE A DOCKING STATION AND UH PROBABLY L. C. D. AND IF THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND UH THE POSSIBILITY TO UH ENLARGE BUTTONS OR TO HAVE LARGE BUTTONS
IN GENERAL
OKAY SO NOT TOO MUCH TELETEXT SUPPORT BUT IN A SEPARATE MENU AND
OKAY BUT NO MORE BUTTONS OR FUNCTIONS OR
AREN'T WE FORGETTING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT
PING
YEAH
AND A SEE THROUGH UH
OKAY WELL THAT'S THE
SIGNAL FOR LAS FINAL FIVE MINUTES
UM SO I HAVE UH THE THINGS I JUST READ
UM THEN WE HAVE UH SEPARATE MENUS FOR TELETEXT SCREEN SETTINGS AUDIO SETTINGS AND WHAT ELSE
CHANNEL SETTINGS
OKAY
NO WE SAID TELETEXT ALSO A SEPARATE MENU
OKAY BUT WE CAN WORK THAT OUT LATER I GUESS
SO WE'RE HAVING A A GENERAL MENU WITH THE MOST USED FUNCTIONS UH TELETEXT SCREEN SETTINGS
AUDIO SETTINGS CHANNEL SETTINGS AND MAYBE THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR THE REMOTE ITSELF
LIKE UH LARGE ICONS OR SMALL ICONS AND
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE BUT
YEAH BUT ON THE L. C. D. HUH
RIGHT YEAH OKAY
BUT WE DON'T NEED A SPECIAL WE DON'T NEED A SPECIAL OPTIONS MENU FOR THE REMOTE ITSELF
OKAY
WELL MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A SEPARATE BUTTON APART FROM THE L. C. D. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TURN IT ON WHEN THE L. C. D. IS OFF
SO HOW DO YOU TURN THE THING ON
THERE HAS TO BE A ON BUTTON ON THE REMOTE HUH
TAP THE THING
OKAY
AND THEN THE TELEVISION IS ON ALSO OR JUST THE REMOTE
SURE
OKAY WELL
YEAH
SO ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A A BUTTON LESS UH REMOTE
NO BUTTONS AT ALL
OKAY WELL THAT'S MIGHT BE A UNIQUE SELLING POINT HUH FOR A REMOTE
OKAY WELL I GUESS WE HAVE TO
POSTPONE FURTHER DISCUSSION TO UH OUR NEXT MEETING BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME
UM FOR NOW WE'RE HAVING A LUNCH BREAK
AND THEN THERE WILL BE UH HALF AN HOUR FOR THE UH NEXT SHARE OF INDIVIDUAL WORK
I WILL UH WRITE UH MINUTES IF I CAN CREATE THEM OUT OF THIS
AND UH PUT THEM IN THE THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS UH FOLDER
AND HERE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS FOR THE FOR THE OTHER ROLES
AND OF COURSE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU AGAIN BY YOUR UH PERSONAL COACH
LUCKILY AS WE ARE
OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR NOW AND UH HAVE A NICE LUNCH HUH
YEAH
CHOOSE A NUMBER
YES
WELL
WELL EVERYBODY ALREADY HAS HIS PRESENTATION SO YOU CAN ADJUST IT
YEAH
OH RIGHT
THERE IS SOMETHING TURNING
YEAH I'VE GOT IT THERE TOO
YEAH
SHALL I GO UH NEXT
'KAY
SO
WELL UH MY NAME'S AND I LOOKED AT UH TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN OF THE REMOTE
UH I DID THIS BY UH LOOKING AT EXAMPLES OF OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS OF HOW THEY UH THEY LOOK AND INFORMATION FROM THE WEB THAT I FOUND
UM WELL WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT UH TH THE ACTUAL USE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TO SEND MESSAGES TO TELEVISION SET
HOW YOU UH D WHAT YOU DESCRIBED UH JUST EARLY
AND THIS CAN BE ALL SORTS OF MEDSA MESSAGES TURN IT ON TURN IT OFF UH CHANGE THE CHANNEL ADJUST VOLUME THAT KIND OF THING
UH PLAY VIDEO TELETEXT BUT ALSO T UH PLAY C. D. IF YOU USE IT YOUR C. D. PLAYER THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL THAT ONE
THERE ARE SOME UH EXAMPLES OF REMOTE CONTROLS
YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT
THE ONE HAS GOT ALL THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED AND AN LOT OF UH BUTTONS ETCETERA
AND THE OTHER IS UH MORE USER FRIENDLY LITTLE WITH BIG BUTTONS
AND UH NOT N ALL THE THE THE THE STUFF YOU CAN DO WITH IT BUT UH THE THE ESSENTIAL STUFF IS THERE
UM I GUESS YOU COULD BETTER Y YOU SHOULD LOOK AT A A USER CENTRED UH APPROACH
BECAUSE THE CUSTOMERS HAVE TO USE THEM AND AND IF THEY DON'T THINK IT'S USABLE THEY WON'T UH BUY IT
A LOT OF BUTTONS THEY MAY THINK FROM I DON'T NEED S AS MUCH AS THAT
UH WELL PERF PERSONAL PREFERENCES IS IS UH A SIMPLE REMOTE WITH UH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS THAT YOU CAN NEED THAT YOU COULD USE
BUT UH KEEP IN MIND THE NEW FUNCTIONS OF T. V. WHAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER SPLIT SCREEN AND UH IS THAT A FUNCTION THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE
BECAUSE ALL THE T. V. S WILL HAVE THEM
OR BECAUSE OF ONLY A FEW AND ISN'T REALLY NECESSARY
AND THEN UH MAKE IT I WOULD MAKE SO THAT YOU CAN COULD UH USE IT ON MORE THAN ONE APPLIANCE
IF YOU HAVE ONE THAT UH UH DOES WITH THE VI THE THE VIDEO
IT COULD ALSO WORK WITH UH WITH THE STEREO BECAUSE PLAY IS PLAY AND STOP STOP AND THAT SORT OF THING
THE SHU C YOU COULD REUSE THE BUTTONS SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS FOR UH ANYTHING
AND IT SHOULD BE A USER FRIENDLY CLEAR BUTTONS AND NOT TOO MUCH
AND THAT IS MY PRESENTATION
YOU MUST STILL HAVE IT OPEN
YEAH
HMM
MM
OH RIGHT
NO
RES I DID NOT
PERHAPS THE REST
OH
MM
WELL YOU SAID IT SHOULD ONLY UH WORK WITH ONE APPLIANCE
OR WITH ONE UH D CHE ONLY THE T. V.
AND THE VIDEO ALSO OR NOT UH
OH
ALRIGHT
OKAY
YEAH
THEN IT SHOULD HAVE UH ON OFF AND UH
YEAH
AND PER PERHAPS UH
NO
WELL UH UH YES YES S SH A BUTTON WHERE YOU CAN UH CHANGE FROM ONE NUMBER TO TWO NUMBERS
CAN YOU DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOT A NAME BUT
YEAH
S
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SO YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT ONE ON
MUTE MISSCHIEN ALSO
AN
BUT DO YOU
BUT IF YOU WOULD DO AN L. C. D. SCREEN DO WE HAVE DON DON'T YOU HAVE ANY BUTTONS
OR BECAUSE IF IT ONLY DIRECTS AT THE T. V. THEN YOU ONLY HAVE UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH
OH RIGHT SO YOU CAN
OH YEAH ALRIGHT
SO YOU CAN ADJUST WHICH BUTTONS YOU WANT ON THAT S SCREEN
YEAH ALRIGHT OH RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
WOULD BE YEAH
WELL WE HAD TWELVE FIFTY I GUESS FOR UH PRODUCTION
YEAH
I DUNNO HOW EXPENSIVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN IS
ANY GUESSES
YEAH
BUT
BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT WE SHOULD NOT ONLY FOCUS ON THE YOUNGER PEOPLE
BUT ALSO ON THE OLDER AND WILL THEY USE IT IF IT ONLY HAS AN L. C. D. SCREEN
OH SO STILL A LITTLE BIT PEOPLE
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO ALIENATE THE OTHER UH
BUT IF THEY ALSO BUY IT THEN IT'S ALRIGHT
I GUESS
YEAH
ALRIGHT
AN YES
YEAH
YEAH
BUT PERHAPS LATER SO UH
YEAH
I DON'T
WELL PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE A BACKUP PLAN THAT WE WOULD USE BUTTONS IF IT'S UH TOO EXPENSIVE
YEAH
THE L. C. D.
OH THAT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM
OH THAT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM
YEAH BUT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T LIKE IT
THEY THINK IT'S UGLY
WHEN IT HAS AN L. C. D. SCREEN
OH ALRIGHT I THOUGHT THAT YOU SAID THAT
YEAH
YEAH
A MUTE BUTTON
I THINK
AND
YEAH
BUT
BUT SHOULDN'T YOU PUT A BUTTON OF FOR TELETEXT ON THE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE IT
REMEMBERING WE HAVE GOT A BIG REMOTE THAT YOU HAVE TO FILL
YEAH
YEAH THEY ARE LESS IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE THERE OR NOT
LIKE WITH A WITH A MOUSE YOU HAVE NOT YEAH
WE SHOULD THINK OF THE TWELVE FIFTY WE HAVE BUT
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT'S GOING TO UH
YEAH
YOU SHOULD PERHAPS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO SWITCH THE CONTROL OFF
IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN THAT'S BURNS ALL THE TIME I DUNNO
YOU SHOULDN'T ON AND OFF BECAUSE THAT'S VER EXTRA
THAT YOU HAVE T FIRST YOU HAVE TO TURN THE REMOTE ON AND THEN YOU CAN UH I DON'T KNOW
NEE THAT'S THAT'S UH YEAH
BUT THEN YOU CAN'T
YEAH
YEAH YEAH AU AUTOMAC MATICALLY THAT IT YEAH
YEAH
IF IT'S SENSIBLE
YEAH
YEAH B WHEN THE BATTERIES ARE LOW
BUT YOU'LL ALSO FORGET TO PUT IT IN BECAUSE YOU THROW IT ON THE COUCH AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER
YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
WELL I THINK THE BATTERIES SHOULD SHOULD W SHOULD WORK A LOT LONGER THAN A COUPLE OF DAYS OR NOT
'CAUSE
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT BUT
YEAH
RIGHT
BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO S HAVE SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN PUT A REMO RECHARGER NEAR YOUR COUCH BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO WALK A LONG WAY WHEN YOU TWOFT WANT TO TURN ON THE T. V.
YEAH
I THINK EVERYTHING HAS IT FOR AND I GUESS
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH TWELVE FIFTY TWELVE FIFTY
SO IT'S PRETTY BIG
YEAH
W I KNOW LET'S DO A SPEECH
YEAH
YEAH
YOU CAN CLAP OR SOMETHING
YEAH
NOW YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THE WRONG THING I DUNNO
BUT THEY WANT TO TALK INTO THE REMO REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING OR
OH BUT DO WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT THAT OR
YEAH
I KNOW
MM
WELL
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THE COST OF TWELVE FIFTY
WITH THAT UH
YEAH BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO IMPLEMENT THAT THAT YOU SAY VOLUME UP AND THEN IT GOES UP OR
UH
THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IF WE GO INTERNATIONAL
THEN UH IT'S Y IT'S YOURS TO DO A FRENCH AND DUTCH AND ENGLISH AND
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN USE ICONS FOR THE
A SPEAKER AND UH
BUT IF THAT'S BETTER THAN LANGUAGE FOR THE FOR THE REMOTE
THEN IT'S YEAH
WELL IF IT COULD BE DONE WE
YEAH
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE UH ANYTHING MATTERS
WELL YOU SH YOU SHOULD TO ADJUST THE THING
YEAH
AND YOU HAVE TO SPEAK THE SO THAT IT CAN UNDERSTAND
YOU COULD USE THAT N AS AN OPTION IF YOU HAVE MONEY LEFT OR SOMETHING
YEAH
LET'S DO SPEECH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
I WITH UH TELETEXT IF IT WASN'T VER VERY IMPORTANT IT WAS BUT YOU ALSO NOW HAVE COLOURS
I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT THAT
YEAH WHEN YOU PRESS THE RED BUTTON YOU GO TO PAGE ONE HUNDRED TWO AND WHEN YOU PRESS THE
I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT THAT BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT TELETEXT NOT REALLY IMPORTANT BUT YEAH THE SHORTCUT AND YOU CAN'T GO TO SPORT
YEAH
'CAUSE IT SHOULD BE THERE
SO ACTUALLY IT IS THERE BUT IT'S JUST NOT R READY THERE
YOU'LL HAVE TO SEARCH FOR IT
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A
I GUESS NOT
WE'VE GOT ANON
HAVE GOT GOT TWO EXAMPLES HERE BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING WE'RE MISSING
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE VIDEO ORDERS
YEAH YOU COULD LOOK HERE ALL THE THE
UH TH TH TH TH I DON'T KNOW TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
THEY'RE A BIT SMALL YOU CAN WE SHOULD STRETCH THEM BECAUSE
I GUESS WE'VE GOT THEM ALL
AND FOR A T. V.
CAN YOU ZOOM IN A T. V.
OR THAT YOU CAN PUT 'EM ON UH ON ON WIDE AND YEAH
BUT THAT SHOULD ALSO BE A SUB THEN A SUB UH MENU THING
YEAH SO WE SHOULD ALSO IMPLEMENT SE SCREEN SETTINGS
OH RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH SO YOU CAN PROGRAM THE
YEAH SO THE FIRST YOU SEE THE MAIN AND THE OTHER ONES YOU CAN UH GO TO UH
YEAH
I HOPE WE CAN DO THIS
WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THAT TOP
YEAH
YEAH
AND DO WE WANT THEM IN DIFFERENT COLOURS OR
AND AND THE BUTTONS SHOULD THEY HAVE COLOURS
OH BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS
YEAH
THEY THINK IT'S UGLY RIGHT
PERHAPS YOU CAN UH MAKE ADJUSTABLE FRONTS LIKE WITH THE TELEPHONES
YOU CAN UH BUT I DON'T THINK THAT UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
A DISCO VERSION
FIVE MINUTES
OH YEAH RIGHT
SO YOU CAN PROGRAM THE T. V.
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD YOU'D THROW THEM ON ON IN ONE PILE
SO OPTIONS AND THEN YOU SUB THEM
OTHERWISE YOU HAVE ALL THOSE TELETEXT PERHAPS TELETEXT NOT BUT
YEAH BUT I
YEAH
YEAH
BUT
I DON'T KNOW
OR DO WE HAVE ANY BUTTONS
ON THE REMOTE
WHICH ONE
BUT THAT'S ALSO IN THE L. C. D. RIGHT
SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY NORMAL BUTTONS THAT UH NO ALRIGHT
YET ON AND OFF IS P IS PERHAPS YOU KNO
NO NO
OH WELL YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET WHICH T. V. YOU HAVE
IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE UH
YEAH
BUT ISN'T IDEA TO USE UH UH WHAT YOU SAID UH NORMAL ON AND OFF BUTTON FOR THE T. V. THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE A
YEAH BUT BUT NOT FOR THE REMOTE BUT FOR THE T. V. THAT YOU USE
BUT A NOT AS NORMAL BUTTON IN THE L. C. D. YEAH
NO YOU JUST TAP I THINK
BUT
YEAH A YEAH
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S HANDY TO HAVE A N A NORMAL ON BUTTON
A R JUST UH RUBBER UH FOR FOR T. V. SO YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE THE CHANNEL
OTHERWISE YOU I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S
YEAH YEAH
TO TURN IT ON
OF OR YOU SHOULD PUT IT IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH I HAVE YEAH
WELL I I GUESS IF YOU USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU FIRST HAVE TO SEARCH WHERE IS THE ON BUTTON
THEN YOU UH YOU YOU THEN TURN IT AND THEN THE T. V. GOES ON
BUT IF YOU HAVE A NORMAL ON BUTTON ON THE ON THE REMOTE THEN YOU DO THE ON AND THEN YOU SEARCH THE CHANNEL WHICH YOU WANT
OH RIGHT
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
OTHERWISE Y WET E K YEAH
YEAH
IF WE CAN AFFORD IT
ALRIGHT
LUNCH
SHOULD WE PUT THIS BACK IN OUR ROOMS OR UH
YEAH
ONE QUESTION
SEND
SUBMIT
MM
YEAH
I'LL GO FIRST
OKAY
I'LL GO FIRST YEAH
SO
HUH
OKAY UM
OKAY UM I WANTED TO EXPLAIN THE WORKING DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S POSSIBLY VERY HANDY IF YOU WANT TO UH DESIGN ONE OF THOSE
UM
WELL SO IT BASICALLY WORKS UH AS I UH UH R WROTE DOWN UH IN THIS UH LITTLE UH SUMMARY
UH WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON UH THAT'S WHEN YOU DO PR FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU UH WANT TO TURN UP THE VOLUME
UM A LITTLE CONNECTION IS MADE UH THE THE RUBBER UH BUTTON JUST PRESSES ON A
ON A LITTLE PRINT PLATE UH WHICH UH MAKES UH UH A CONNECTION THAT UH
GIVES THE CHIPS UH WHICH IS UH MOUNTED BENEATH THOSE UH THAT PLASTIC OF A RUBBER BUTTON
UH SENSES THAT A CONNECTION HAS BEEN MADE AND KNOW AND KNOWS WHAT BUTTON YOU PRESSED BECAU UH FOR EXAMPLE THE THE VOLUME UP OR VOLUME DOWN BUTTON
UM UH THE THE CHIP UH MAKES A MORSE CODE UH LIKE UH SIGNAL WHICH UH THEN IS SI UH SIGNALLED TO UH SEVERAL TRANSISTORS WHICH MAKES UH WHICH SENDS THE SIGNAL TO A LITTLE LET
YOU KNOW WHAT A LET IS
OKAY
AND THAT MAKES UH THE THE INFRA RED LIGHTS SIGNAL WHICH IS SENT TO THE TELEVISION SET
UH WHICH HAS A SENSOR IN IT TO UH SENSE UH THE SIGNAL OF THE INFRA RED
THAT'S BASICALLY UH HOW IT WORKS
UM THE FINDINGS UH UH THAT I FOUND UH SEARCHING UP SOME UH DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE THAT UH THEY ARE VERY EASY TO PRODUCE
UH IT IS PIS UH IT'S POSSIBLE TO UH MAKE THEM IN MASS PRODUCTION BECAUSE IT IS AS EAS IT IS AS EASY AS UH PRINTING A PAGE
UH JUST UH FIBREGLASS PLATE UM IS B UH IS UH COVERED WITH UH SOME UH COATINGS AND UH UH
AND CHIPS
UH AND THE TECHNOLOGY'S ALREADY AVAILABLE
WE DON'T HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW REMOTE CONTROLS UH HAVE TO WORK OR UH HOW THAT HOW UH TO MAKE SOME CHIPS THAT ARE POSSIBLE TO UH TO TO TRANSMIT THOSE UH SIGNALS
UH I MADE A LITTLE UH
UH
ANIMATION OF ABOUT HOW A TRAN OUR UH REMOTE CONTROLLER WORKS
WE TEL
THERE
OKAY
UH WELL THE SUB COMPONENT I SUPPOSE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT A SUB COMPONENT IS IS F IN THIS EXAMPLE IT'S THE BUTTON
UH WHEN IT IS PRESSED DOWN UM THE SWITCH IS TER IS UH IS SWITCHED ON
SO WITH UH THE WIRE IS SENT TO THE TO THE CHIP IN UH CO OPERATION WITH THE BATTERY OF COURSE
BECAUSE TO MAKE UH A A SIGNAL POSSIBLE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF UH
LI UH A D AD UH ELECTRONIC UH
YES UH OKAY
UM W AFTER IT'S BEING COMPOSED BY THE CHIP UH THE SIGNAL UH IS TRANSPORTED UH TO THE INFRA RED BULB
AND FROM THERE IT SIGNALS A MORSE CODE LIKE SIGNAL TO THE TO THE B TO THE BULB IN UH IN THE TELEVISION SET
OKAY
S UH I WROTE DOWN SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES ABOUT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL
OF COURSE IT IS VERY HANDY IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS HAND HELD SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO UH UH WIND IT UP OR SOMETHING
OR JUST IS IT'S IT'S VERY LIGHT TO UH TO MAKE UH TO USE IT
UH I PERSONALLY UH PREF PREFER THAT UH IT WOULD BE P UH COME AVAILABLE IN THE VARIOUS COLOURS AND UH EASY TO USE BUTTONS
BUT I SUPPOSE THAT THE ONE OF THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS UH UH THOUGHT OF THAT UH TOO
AND IT IS POSSIBLE FOR SEVERAL DESIGNS AND UM EASY TO USE B UH SORRY EASY TO USE BUTTONS
PERHAPS SOFT TOUCH UH TOUCH SCREEN UH BUTTONS BECAUSE UH THE RUBBER BUTTONS ARE ALWAYS UH UH THEY UH SLIGHTLY UH THEY CAN BE SLIGHTLY DAMAGED
UH SO THE NUMBERS ON THE BUTTONS ARE NOT POSSIBLE UH TO READ ANYMORE
AND UH WELL AS I SAID UH BEFORE TH UH WE CAN UH MAKE SEVERAL DESIGNS
OKAY WELL THAT'S MY CONTRIBUTION TO THIS MEETING AND UH
TWO OF THESE THIS MEETING
SO
OKAY
HMM
MM
MM
UH L. C. D. SCREEN AS IN UH TOUCH SCREEN
OKAY
'KAY
OKAY
NO
YEAH
MM
YEAH FOR
STANDBY OPTIONS YEAH
UH YEAH
TWO S TWO TWO DIGITS OH OKAY
YEAH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN
YEAH
IT MAKES IT TWELVE YEAH
INDEED
OKAY
WELL NOT REALLY AND AND THERE ARE SOME MODELS THAT DON'T UH ACCOMMODATE THAT FUNCTION
SO D UH WH THE PHILIP'S TELEVISION MAKES IT POSSIBLE IN THAT INDEED TO UH PRESS ONE AND THEN TWO TO MAKE UH THE UH TJ TO REACH CHANNEL TWELVE
BUT UH ALL THE TELEVISION MAKES UH USE OF THOSE BUTTON WHERE YOU FIRST PRESS THAT BUTTON AND THEN PRESS TWO DIGITS TO UH TO GET
UH YEAH THINK SO
MM
MM-HMM
YEAH WE WE COULD YEAH
BUT I THINK THAT UH THAT COLLIDES WITH OUR MISSION TO MAKE IT VERY CHEAP
BECAUSE L. C. D. SCREENS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE
A TOUCH SCREEN UH PROBABLY UH EVEN MORE
SO TRUE TRUE
BUT UH
WELL UM IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN UH HOW WAS THE INFORMATION
SO PERHAPS WE SHOULD WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH BUT UH WILL WE NOT UH
EXCEED OUR UH OUR UH PRODUCTION UH
IS IT POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT ANYWAY
YOU KNOW
NO AN L. C. D. SCREEN'S JUST LIKE UH LIKE A DRAWN HERE
UM JUST UH DISPLAYS SEVERAL BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE UM IF YOU WANTED THE MINIMAL UH USE B UH BUTTONS
SUCH AS CHANNEL AND VOLUME
YOU JUST H UH DISPLAYS FOUR BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO P UH PRESS THEM DOWN JUST LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN
YEAH WE CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DO THAT YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S MY UH
YEAH
TWELVE FIFTY
UM
WELL I SUPPOSE WI IF THE MAR IF OUR UM
IF THE I IF THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN L. C. D. SCREENS WE SHOULD MAKE 'EM
AND IF THAT IS OUR D UH MARKET SHARE TO UH AND OUR GOAL TO UH DELIVER THOSE UH REMOTE CONTROLS
YEAH
YEAH
MM
IT'S TREASURE
I HOPE WE UH H AND LET'S HOPE TO REACH THOSE UH THOSE SALES
YEAH CAN YOU UM UH S I THINK THAT THAT THEY WILL SEND YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT UH THE COST OF L. C. D. UH SCREENS
UH SO IF YOU UH YEAH SO IF YOU UH YOU RECEIVE AN EMAIL ABOUT THAT
UH CAN YOU POST IT IN THE OR SHOULDN'T WE POST THAT IN UH OUR PROJECTS MAIL UH FOLDER
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE THE MARKETING UH EXPERT
I UH
YEAH SURE SURE
MM
IT'S LOOKS FANCY ONE YEAH OF L. C. D. SCREEN
MM YEAH
AND THEN NOT YEAH
UM
YEAH
MM
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
AND THERE'S ALSO A
A SH BUT IN A SUB SUB MENU OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UH MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO UM HOW DO YOU CALL IT IN ENGLISH UH
TO NOT USE BATTERIES AND USE AC UH BAT UH BATTERIES TO UH TO BE YEAH YEAH SURE
INDEED
SO UH YOU CAN MOUNT UH THE THE THE UH
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL TO UM
TO REFILL THE
YEAH
OKAY BECAUSE I UH WHEN YOU GET AN L. C. D. SCREEN YOU RUN IT ON BATTERIES THE BATTERIES WILL BE UH EMPTY VERY SOON VERY FAST
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
UH
AND GO TO STANDBY MODE WHEN YOU DON'T USE IT SO THAT
YEAH AUTOMATICALLY
AFTER TWO MINUTES OR THREE MINUTES SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
SURE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
NO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH S UH W UH WATCHING YOUR TELEVISION YOU HAVE TO PUT IT
YEAH SURE OF COURSE
YEAH BUT
BUT YOU ALSO FORGET TO BUY BATTERIES AND THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN'T USE IT SO I
YEAH
HIGH POWER USER CELL I
UH IT SHOULD BE UH A STANDARD MOVE TO TO PUT YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IN THE CHARGER WHEN YOU'RE DONE WATCHING TELEVISION
THAT'S ALSO A A A GREAT ADVANTAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LOSE IT ANYMORE
BECAUSE YOU ARE OBLIGED TO UH PUT IT IN THE CHARGER AND NOT TO UH LEAVE IT IN A COUCH UH BETWEEN SOME CUSHIONS
OKAY
YEAH IT HASN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BIG
YEAH JUST JUST A CABLE OR A EVEN A A A A A CHARGER WHERE YOU CAN MOUNT IT ON
SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST U
OKAY
FUNCTIONAL DESIGNS UH FOR THE ELDERLY UH YOU COULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ENLARGE THE SCREEN
SO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO NOT UH DISPLAY UH A BUTTON AT TEN POINTS UH OR
YEAH BUT IT IS UH ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS YOU HAVE TO UH SPECIFY
BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK AT UH UH PERHAPS UH FORTY BUTTONS AT A SCREEN BUT THE ELDERLY ONLY LOOK AT TWO BUTTONS
OKAY
SPEECH RECOGNITION
HELLO
TWELVE EURO TWELVE EURO FIFTY
WELL SPREAD IT BY A BIG MARKET
WELL LET'S LEAVE OUT ALL THE REMOTE CONTROLS AND JUST PUT A MICROPHONE ON TOP OF THE TELEVISION TO
YEAH YEAH
TURN VOLUME UP
HEY THAT THAT'S AN IDEA
OKAY WELL THAT SHOULD IT HAS TO BE REMOTE CONTROL NOT
YEAH
SURE WHY NOT WHY NOT
YEAH MM
YEAH
PERHAPS THE OPTIONS SHOULD BE UH
WHY NOT
WHY NOT
LET'S HOPE UH TO HAVE SOME UH D
WE SHOULD DO IT
YEAH
SURE
YEAH
CERTAIN SYSTEMS ALREADY EXIST I THINK
TRUE YEAH
YEAH
THIS SHOULD BE UH ACCOMMODATED WITH SOME SOFTWARE UH UH
YEAH
RIGHT
SWAHILI
SWAHILI
YEAH
INDEED
YEAH
SO WE WANT TO UH YEAH IT'S INTERNATIONAL UH OKAY
OKAY
Y IT SHOULD BE DONE
IF IT COULD BE DONE SHOULD BE DONE
THAT'S NOT SO DIFFICULT AT ALL BECAUSE I ALREADY USE ON SEVERAL VOICE OPERATED SYSTEMS AND THEY ARE ALL POSSIBLE TO UH NOT ALL BUT
YEAH SURE INDEED
FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
UH YEAH
S SHORTCUTS
UH
MM
SH YEAH JUST JUST SUB MENU
YEAH
NOT DIRECTLY UH AVAILABLE
OKAY
MM
DIRECTLY AVAILABLE
SO DOES IT CONFUSE UH THE USER
UH
I'LL SEARCH UM
IF YOU WANT TO USE TELETEXT YOU CAN PUSH THE TELETEXT BUTTON AND THEN THE OPTIONS UH BECOME AVAILABLE
NO
MENU
MM
THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS DEPENDING UH ON WHAT KIND OF TELEVISION YOU GOT
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T GOT A WIDE SCREEN TELEVISION YOU DON'T NEED THE UH THE SCREEN SETTINGS UH FOR UH
YEAH AND IF THE TELEVISION DOES NOT SUPPORT SUCH UH OPERATIONS
YEAH
YEAH
COLOURS I THINK THE MAIN COLOUR OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH THE COLOUR OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN
I BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT A LOT A DEVI YEAH A DEVICE SELF S G
OKAY SO USE UH VERY UH LOT OF PEO
ADJUST WITH PHONES YES
OKAY
TWELVE EURO FIFTY
WELL MAKE IT AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT COLOURS YOU MEAN
SURE
RED WHITE BLUE BLACK
GREY
YEAH SEA VIEW YES SIMPSON'S VERSIONS AND
LEAVE
YEAH
MM
NO
UH NOT BUTTON
YEAH SURE OF COURSE YOU NEED UH A SETTINGS BUTTON UH OR A SETTINGS OPTION FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
JUST TAP IT
YEAH IT SHOULD BE IN STANDBY MODE BUT
A A A NORMAL BUTTON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OR NORM
YEAH BECAUSE UH WHEN YOU TOUCH THE L. C. D. SCREEN WHEN IT IS IN STANDBY MODE IT SHOULD POP ON
WH UH WHY WOULD IT BE A A NEED TO HAVE A NORMAL BUTTON
MM
I THINK IT LOOKS A LOT MORE FANCY IF YOU USE UH IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS ON THE S ON ON REMOTE CONTROL
OH OKAY
OH
MM
OKAY
FOOD
YEAH THINK SO
YEP YEP YEP YEP
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL SHALL I GO FIRST WITH THE USERS
I THINK WELL OKAY NO PROBLEM
JA PRECIES JA PRECIES JA PRECIES
E. I. E.
ANIMATION
INFRARED LIGHT
TO THIS MEETING
SMOKING
'KAY
CHECK
KIJKE
'KAY SO
WE'RE GOING TO J DISCUSS THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE REMOTE THAT M THAT MEANS THAT FUNCTIONS USER N WANT TO HAVE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OR JUST
YEAH AND THE USERS ACTUALLY
THE METHODS I I PREFER IS WE'RE GOING TO LOOK WHICH SECTION OF THE USERS WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS A L ON MORE
ARE THE YOUNGER PEOPLE GOING TO BUY THE REMOTE CONTROL OR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE
AND THEN THO THAT SECTION WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS AND ADJUST THE REMOTE MORE TO THAT SECTION THAN THE WHOLE USER
SECTION
OKAY
SOME DATA
YOUNGER PEOPLE FROM SIXTEEN TO THIR FORTY FIVE UM YEARS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN FJ FEATURES LIKE L. C. D. SCREENS SPEECH RECOGNITION E ETCETERA
AND WE POSSESS ABOUT TWO THIRD OF THE MARKET FROM IN THAT RANGE OF AGE
THE ELDERLY PEOPLE FROM FORTY FIVE YEARS TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS ARE NOT THAT MUCH INTERESTED IN FEATURES
AND WE POSSESS LESS THAN TWO THIRD THAT'S TWO FIFTH OF THE MARKET SHARE IN THAT AREA
GOED SO
'KAY
FINDINGS
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS LOSE THEIR REMOTE OFTEN
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT VERY SMALL LIKE UH LIKE A MOBILE PHONE OR SOMETHING
BUT SOME SOMEWHAT BI BIGGER THAN SMALL SO YOU DON'T LOSE IT THAT MUCH ANYMORE
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS ALSO FIND IT UGLY AND FIF SEVENTY FIVE OF THE USERS ZAP A LOT
SO THE BUTTONS SH SHOULD BE THAT SMALL OR SHOULDN'T BE THAT COMPLEX BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THE BUTTONS WHICH ONE ARE YOU GOING TO USE
NEXT
IMPORTANT ISSUES ABOUT THE REMOTE
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH A PERSONAL REFERENCE BUT OKAY
REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO HAVE TO HAVE A LOW POWER USAGE BECAUSE S W
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS ONLY ZAP ONE TIME AN HOUR SO THE POWER USAGE IS ALSO ONE ONE TIME AN HOUR
OR SO WITH A HIGH POWER USAGE WE WOULD
USE A LOT OF BUT BATTERIES
THE VOLUME BUTTON AND THE CHANNEL BUTTONS ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL SO THOSE THEY THOSE HAVE TO H BE FIND VERY EASILY
AND HAVE TO BE SOMEWHAT LIKE BIGGER
ETCETERA
IT HAS ALSO BE HAVE TO FIND EASILY WHEN THE LABEL IS GONE
MY COLLEAGUE ALSO ANNOUNCED IT THAT LABELS SHOULD BE SCRATCHED OFF OR WOULD BE S UH
SENDEN OKAY
SO UH IF THAT'S K UH IF THAT'S THE PROBLEM YOU ALSO HAVE TO FIND IT EASILY
ON THE REMOTE
BUTTONS
LIKE WHAT ALL COLLEAGUES SAID HAVE TO HAVE TO BE MINIMALIZED
OR SHOULD BE COVERED OR IN L. C. D. SCREEN
L. C. D. SCREEN IS EASY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE HAVE THE VARIOUS OPTIONS
PUT ONE OPTION AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ALL THE BUTTONS OF THAT OPTIONS SO THE OTHER OPTIONS WOULD BE GONE
AND YOU DON'T SEE THE BUTTONS
SO L. C. D. SCREENS SHOULD BE EASY
BUT AN L. C. D. SCREEN
THE PROBLEM WITH THE L. SC L. C. D. SCREEN IS THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE FR FROM FORTY FIVE TO FOR SIXTY FIVE YEARS DON'T USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN A LOT
SO WE HAVE TO THAT KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT L. C. D. SCREEN
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT THAT HARD TO LEARN OR TO USE
YEAH TOUCH SCREEN YEAH
THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE MORE CRITICAL ABOUT THE FEATURES
BECAUSE THEY USE THE REMOTE CONTROL OFTEN MORE OFTEN AND ARE MORE TECHNICAL THAN THE OL OLDER PEOPLE
AND THE OLDER PEOPLE SPEND MORE MONEY AND EASILY ON A REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND TO TO FOCUS NOT A LOT NOT THAT MUCH ON THE YOUNGER PEP YOUNGER PEOPLE BUT ALSO SOMEWHAT ON THE ELDERLY PEOPLE
AND ON MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES I DON'T HAVE ANY MO MORE TIME TO COME WITH THAT BUT LIKE I SAID
L. C. D. SCREEN IS EASILY TO USE BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOU CAN IMPLEMENT A LOT OF BUTTONS IN ONE REMOTE WITH NOT THAT MUCH BUTTONS
AND IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
ESPECIALLY THE VOLUME BUTTONS THE CHANNEL BUTTES BUTTONS AND THE NUMBER BUTTONS TO ZAP THROUGH THE CHANNELS
AND THAT IS IT
JA
BE TELEVISION
ONLY THE TELEVISION
SO YEAH THEN YOU CAN YEAH
REQUIREMENTS NO
FUNCTIONS
YEAH THE BASICS THEN BY A VOLUME CHANNEL ONE TILL TWO ZERO NUMBERS ON IT OH TELETEXT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
UM OTHER FUNCTIONS
YEAH I HAD
YEAH YEAH
I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT A BUTTON WITH A S S WHAT WHICH ESPECIALLY DO THAT BECAUSE SOME T. V. S
IF YOU PRESS THE T ONE AND THEN THE TWO IT BE BETWEEN FIVE SECS IT MAKE TWELVE AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT RELAXED
TO USER
YEAH
SO THAT IT EASY AND FAST
YEAH
OUR MAIN TARGETS' AGE ARE
WERE
FORTY FIVE PLUS OR
FORTIES OKAY BECAUSE BECAUSE YOUNGER PEOPLE AS
UH YOUNGER PEOPLE HAVE NOW SIXTEEN TILL TO TWENTY FIVE AGE ARE F EIGHTY ONE PERCENT INTERESTED IN L. C. D. SCREEN
FROM TWENTY SIX TO THIRTY FIVE HAVE SIXTY SIX PERCENT AND THIRTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE FIFTY FIVE PERCENT SO I THINK TO UM
BECAUSE ON MOST RECOG REMOTE CONTROLS UM THE PRINT PLATE WILL BE BROKEN HOW MUCH TWO YEARS
YOU HAVE TO PRESS H VERY HARD TO GO TO THE NEXT CHANNEL
WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN IT'S EASIER BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE TO WIPE THE SCREEN TO UH FOR FINGERPRINT AND THEN YOU CAN USE IT AGAIN
YEAH OKAY
YEAH BUT A YOU DON'T KNOW
TRUE
YEAH IT ONLY SAYS THAT THIS PERCE PERCENTAGE LIKE L. C. D. SCREEN
BECAUSE YEAH AND IT SAYS THAT YOUNGER AGE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND FORTY FIVE HIGHLY INTERESTING FEATURES MORE CRITICAL
AND IF THE ONLY F
YEAH BECAUSE OUR TARGET IS SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE
YEAH YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS
YEAH YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
NO I DON'T HAVE ANY COSTS HERE I ONLY HAVE PERCENTAGES
YEAH
YEAH IF YOU WANT TO ADJUST LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ADJUST THE AUDIO SETTINGS
YOU PRESS AUDIO ON THE TOUCHSCREEN AND YOU GET THE BUTTONS FOR AUDIO SETTINGS SO THE OTHER BUTTONS ARE GONE
I THINK IT'S THE MOST EASIER THING YEAH
NO
YEAH
HIGHLY
YEAH BUT
UM S FORTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE THIRTY THREE PERCENT AND SIXTY FIFTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE TWELVE PERCENT
BUT OUR OUR OUR WHAT'S IT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ARE THE NEW PRODUCTS SHOULD BE REACHED FOR NEW MARKETS TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN FORTY
NO THAT NOT NOW BUT SO
YEAH BUT MARKET SHARE FRO FOR FOR FORTY YEARS AND YOUNGER IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF SIXTY FIVE AND YOUNGER
YEAH I I IF IT YEAH IF IT COSTS GETS TOO MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE THEN YEAH WE SHOULD BE STICKING TO RUBBER BUTTONS
N NOTHING NO COSTS AT ALL
YEAH IN
I THINK THAT SHOULD YEAH I THINK WE ALL GET THE COSTS OF EVERYTHING
YEAH OKAY I'LL I'LL POST IT
YEAH
OKAY L. C. D. YEAH
THEN YOU HAVE THE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND IT R UGLY
YEAH AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WITH A WHEN A REMOTE WOULD LOOK FANCY
THA I L I IT'LL LOOK FANCY WITH L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH
YEAH JUST A THE PLAIN REMOTES NOT NOT SPECIFIC L. C. D. REMOTES
SO
MM-HMM
YEAH OF COURSE
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OTHER THING THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT ZAP A LOT BUT THAT'S NOT A F QUESTION WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN
ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS WIPE THE SCREEN OFF ONCE EACH TIME TO GET ALL THE FINGERPRINTS OFF IT
UM
MM-HMM
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ON A F ON AN ON AN UH REMOTE CONTROL ARE CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME CON SELECTION
AND POWER S POWER USAGE
AND A TELETEXT BUT THAT IS NOT OF THE QUESTION
OTHER THINGS ARE
SORRY
YEAH IT COULD BE
YEAH
YEAH TELETEXT
AND OTHER OTHER LESS IMPORTANT THINGS ARE SCREEN SETTINGS AUDIO SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS BUT
LESS IMPORTANT
YEAH SHOULD BE THERE BUT NOT PRESS YEAH SUB MENU YEAH
YEAH IN A BREATH IT'S
CHARTED
YEAH BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY COSTS NOW SO YEAH
YEAH E E POWER SUPPLY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
YEAH
I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT THAT EASY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT WHO WHO UH THAT YOU HAVE TO TURN IT ON FIRST AND THEN USE IT
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER WHEN TH THE T. V. SHUTS DOWN THE REMOTE SHUTS DOWN
YEAH
YEAH
AFTER TWO MINUTES YEAH TWO THREE MINUTES YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN B THAT UH BEFORE AN HOUR WHEN ITS GET AGAIN GETS EMPTY
THEN YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO RECHARGE IT OF PUT IT IN A RECHARGER
CHARGER
YEAH IF IT'S
UH
YEAH BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. YOU'RE ZAPPING AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN A RECHARGER AND I DON'T THINK IT
YEAH OKAY BUT THEN WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE THE THE THE BATTERIES GO HOURS SIX HOURS FIVE SIX HOURS THEN
YEAH THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
OR WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE BATTERIES LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WHEN THEY'RE RECHARGED
SO
YEAH BECAUSE YOU HAVE B BUT YOU HAVE L. C. D. SCREEN
HIGH POWER USAGE
YES
TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
TRUE
YEAH YOU MADE A POINT THERE
YEAH OTHERWISE ALL YOUR YEAH
JUST A SMALL DEVICE
PLUG IT IN THAT'S IT
YEAH LIKE A LIKE TELEPHONE CHARGER OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
IT HAS TO BE EASY TO USE ALSO OR THINGS
UH MARKET SHARE SPEAKER RE SPEECH RECOGNITION
I THINK
ALSO
WELL I THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD
LARGE BUTTON LARGE BUTTONS
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH IT SAYS ALSO YEAH
TWELVE
THAT'S AN ALSO NINETY ONE PERCENT SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
TWENTY SIX TO THIRTY FIVE YEARS SEVENTY SIX PERCENT AND THIRTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
BUT THEN I I I
YEAH
YEAH
NINETY
TWENTY FIVE
CHANNEL
YEAH
YEAH TWELVE
YEAH
IS THIS ONLY WOULD YOU WOULD YOU PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S THE ONLY THING IT SAYS
I THINK AN L. C. D. SCREEN SHOULD BE SUF SUFFICIENT
YEAH IT SAYS A LOT BUT
NO I THINK I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE L. L. C. D. SCREEN BECAUSE IN THE AREA OF TW THIRTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE
WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET SHARE IN IN OUR HANDS AND FIFTY FIVE OF THOSE PEOPLE WANT L. C. D. SCREEN AND THIRTY FIVE WANT SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER TO KEEP IT WITH L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH IF THE COSTS AL ALLOW IT
NEE
IF IT SHOULD BE DONE IF IT COULD BE DONE I WON'T MATTER
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
TRUE
YEAH
TRUE
BUT THAT SHOULD ALSO BE WITH F SHOULD BE ALSO WITH L. C. D. SCREEN
BECAUSE THEN I THINK IN CHINESE IS DIFFERENT WRITTEN VOLUME IS DIFFERENT WRITTEN THAN UM SWAHILI OR SOMETHING
JA WELL POSSIBLE
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
'KAY WHAT ELSE
YEAH WE HAVE TO KEEP YEAH
I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT
EVERY LANGUAGE OF DIALECTS
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFEREN DIFFICULT
YEAH
I THINK IT CAN'T BE IMPLEMENTED BUT MAYBE
YEAH 'S AN OPTION YES
FIFTY EURO CENTS
YEAH
MM YES
NO BUT
CURVED
UM
I THINK WE SHOULD WE COULD THAT WE COULD ALSO IMPLEMENT A AUDIO SETTINGS SCREEN SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS BUT AS SUB MENUS
D MAINLY IF YOU TURN THE UH REMOTE CONTROL ON YOU HAVE TO U YOU HAVE TO SEE FROM ONE TILL ZERO CHANNEL AND VOLUME
AND IF YOU WANT TO USE TELETEXT SCREEN OR AUDIO THEN YOU CAN PRESS IT
IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE BUT NOT
NOT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT S
YEAH
THEY'D HAVE TO BE EASY TO USE
THE SIGN OF IT
UH NO
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO WITH A TELEVISION
UH PLAY PAUSE DOESN'T N NEED TO BE THERE
YES SO THIS IS YOUR PRESENTATION
WE COULD CHECK THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS WITH TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
WHICH ONES WERE YOURS
TECHNI
JA JA JA JA JA
TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
YEAH OKAY
UH I THINK I GO TO HAVE VOLUME MUTE BUT I YEAH
VERY SLOW
YEAH THE ZOOM BUTTONS
YEAH B WIDE SCREEN HIGH SCREEN DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE YEAH DIFFERENT UH YEAH
YEAH IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE BUT THEN IN SEPARATE SCREEN SETTINGS OR SOMETHING
YEAH SCREEN SETTINGS AUDIO SETTINGS TELETEXT SETTINGS YOU HAVE
CHANNEL SETTINGS
SO THOSE FOUR AND OF COURSE THE MAIN
YEAH
YEAH
LIKE TAP SCREENS OR SOMETHING OR I DUNNO
SOMETHING
YEAH IF UH
NO YOU DON'T YU A NO YOU THEN YOU DON'T NO NI DON'T THEN YOU DON'T USE IT
MM-HMM
YEAH
SO YOU LEAVE IT ALONE
YEAH
OR IT COULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE A A STANDARD VERSION OF THE REMOTE AN EXPANDED VERSION
YEAH
COLOURS
YEAH
YEAH THEN DEFINES ITSELF
BECAUSE UH HOW MANY PERCENT
EIGHTY PERCENT
WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY IF IT LOOKS FANCY
YEAH
RASTA COLOURS
YEAH SEE THROUGH VERSION
YEAH
IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON IT TURNS GREEN
CHANNEL SETTINGS
YEAH
MM
YEAH
COULD BE POSSIBLE
OR LIKE UH YOU HAVE A MENU BUTTON YOU PRESS YEAH OR OTHERWISE YOU HAVE A MENU BUTTON
PRESS MENU THEN YOU HAVE UH MAIN UH MENU SEARCH UH ALL THE ALL THE SETTINGS
YEAH NO PROBLEM
YEP
UM I THINK B BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS ON THE ONE SCREEN
I THINK THE BUTTONS YEAH BUT BUT OR LIKE YOU HAVE YOU ONLY HAVE CHANNEL BUTTON OR VOLUME BUTTON
THOSE BUTTONS YOU CAN YOU CAN
YEAH
YEAH TH
NO NO NORMAL BUTTONS YEAH
MAYBE ONLY THE ON AND O ON AND OFF BUTTON
BUT I DON'T THINK
MM NO
NO NO NO BECAUSE WE WE DISCUSSED THAT YOU COULD CHARGE IT OTHERWISE IS IT IT JUMPS TO STAND BY MODE AUTOMATICALLY
YEAH BUT A T. V. OF COURSE
TH THAT'S THE I THINK THAT'S A BEST THING IS THAT TO IMPLEMENT THAT ONE IN THE MENU WITH THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL
NO
YEAH YOU TAP
TOUCH SCREEN YEAH THEN IT'S TURN TURN OFF TURN ON
NO JUST THE REMOTE
A TELEVISION DON'T HAVE TO BE ON THAT ONE YOU CAN PRESS ON YEAH STAND BY
THEN PRESS ON REMOTE PRESS ON AND THEN T. V. SHOULD BE AVAILABLE
OR NOT
SEPARATE
YEAH BUT I THINK THE RE THE REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU PRESS TAP THE SCREEN
IT ALWAYS SHOULD JUMP TO THE SCREEN WHICH HAS THE VOLUME BUTTON CHANNEL BUTTON AND OF COURSE OF ALSO THE ON AND OFF BUTTON
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH IF WE CAN AFFORD IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY WELCOME EVERYONE TO OUR NEXT MEETING
I'M BUSY WRITING AND BUSY LEADING THE MEETING
BUT UM I'VE PREPARED A LITTLE PRESENTATION ONCE AGAIN UM OR AT LEAST AN AGENDA I THINK UH THE BIGGEST PART OF THE PRESENTATION WILL BE UH ON YOUR SIDE
UM WE ARE HERE AT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING WHICH IS HEREBY OPENED
UM ONCE AGAIN I WILL TRY TO UH WRITE SOME MINUTES WHICH I JUST FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING UH PLACED INSIDE OUR PROJECT FOLDER
WHICH WAS QUITE SOME TYPING
UM TODAY WE ONCE AGAIN HAVE UH THREE PRESENTATIONS IF I'M RIGHT AND AFTER THAT WE WILL TAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS
AND JUST AS THE LAST TIME WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES TO ACCOMPLISH THAT
OKAY WELL
I'D SAY LET'S START WITH THE FIRST PRESENTATION
UM IN THE SAME ORDER AS LAST TIME
OKAY
WELL TAKE IT AWAY
MM-HMM
WELL BUSINESS COLOURS I THOUGHT IT WAS THE THE SLOGAN AND UH THE CORPORATE IMAGE SO YEAH IT NEEDS COLOUR
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE ENTIRE THING IN THE CORPORATE COLOUR
IT MUST BE RECOGNISABLE
OKAY THANK YOU
MM
MM-HMM
THANKS
NOW OUR THIRD
TEAM MEMBER WITH HIS PRESENTATION
OH Y
SO FOR THE OLDER PEOPLE A MORE TRADITIONAL UH FORM
YEAH I GUESS CHANGING COLOURS WILL BE EASIER THAN CHANGING UH
THE SHAPE OF IT
BUT MAYBE THEN BOTH GROUPS WON'T BUY IT
MM-HMM
YEAH WE THINK SO TOO
HMM
SO WE NEED A SPONGY FEELING
YEAH
AND WE WON'T INCLUDE A A PEN OR SOMETHING TO POINT HEY WE WE WANT TO DO IT WITH OUR FINGERS RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH BUT I THINK PEOPLE WANT TO USE A REMOTE WITH WITH THEIR FINGERS BECAUSE TH THEY'RE USED TO THAT AND
AND MAYBE WE HAVE TO ADD A TISSUE TO REMOVE THE GREASE FROM ALL THE FINGERS HUH
OKAY WELL MAYBE IF I CAN INTERRUPT YOU MAYBE I SHOULD UH SHOULD SHOW SOME POINTS ON WHICH WE UH SHOULD TAKE A DECISION
SO WE CAN DISCUSS THESE POINTS
THOSE POINTS UM
ENERGY QUESTION MARK
HOW HOW SHOULD WE UH SUPPLY THE THING WITH ENERGY AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT WITH SEPARATE DOCKING STATION AND THEN PUT IN IT
UH CHIP ON PRINT AND CASE
THOSE ARE POINTS MY UH COACH ADVISED ME TO DISCUSS HERE BUT I HOPE YOU HAVE IDEAS ABOUT THEM
YEAH
SO THAT'S THE THE THE FIRST POINT
WE ALREADY DECIDED THAT ON THE PREVIOUS MEETING
MM-HMM
SIMPLE RECHARGEABLE UH BATTERIES
YEAH BUT HOW DID THIS HOW DOES THAT WITH A L. C. D. SCREEN
YOU STILL HAVE A
PRINT PLATE
MM-HMM
YEAH WELL IT'S A GOOD QUESTION
IT JUST WAS IN THERE AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT IT BUT
MM-HMM
WELL YOU NEED SOME KIND OF C. P. U. I GUESS
MM-HMM
BECAUSE WE'RE PROJECTING PROJECTING THE BUTTONS ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH YOU HAVE A FANCY DESIGN THEN RIGHT AWAY
SO
OKAY SO
YEAH BUT I WROTE IT DOWN
WHAT ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE THERE ARE ALSO SOME SOME QUESTIONS UH ABOUT THE CONCEPTS I THINK YOU HAVE SOME IDEAS ON THAT
YOU YOU SHOWED YOUR DRAWING
MM
EVERYBODY'S SEARCHING IN HIS DATA
YEAH WELL I THINK WE HAVE WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT NOW HOW WHERE WE WILL PUT THE BUTTONS JUST THE
CONCEPTS
YEAH WELL WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE NEW UH TECHNOLOGY HUH
MM-HMM
YEAH MAYBE AT THE BOTTOM WHERE YOU CAN CAN HEL HOLD IT WITH YOU HAND THAT THERE'S ALSO A MICROPHONE UH
OVER THERE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WELL MAYBE JUST IN THE THE SPOT YOU JUST POINTED OUT
BECAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN A IN AN IMPORTANT POSITION WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE IT
BECAUSE IT IS THE THE UNIQUE UH IDEA OF OUR REMOTE HUH THE THE SPEECH CONTROL
WELL MAYBE WHERE THE ONE HAND
BUT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE BUTTON OR ABOUT THE MICROPHONE
YEAH BECAUSE A MICROPHONE IS VERY SMALL THING BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S BIG SO AS ITS ITS REALLY AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE REMOTE
SO WELL UH TYPE SUPPLEMENTS
ANYTHING
YEAH WELL WE ALREADY S DISCUSSED THAT HUH THE THE L. C. D. AND
MM-HMM
AND I THINK I WOULD IT WOULD MAKE EVEN MORE FANCY BECAUSE YOU HAVE ANOTHER INTERESTING THING ON THE SIDE WHICH YOU CAN TOUCH AND
YEAH
OKAY
WELL THERE'S OUR FIVE MINUTES UH WARNING
UM ANY MORE UH QUESTIONS ABOUT ABOUT THE DESIGN OR THE USER INTERFACE OR DIFFERENT COMPONENTS EVERYONE
EVERYBODY THINK THEY CAN CAN
WORK FOR THAT
IS THERE A STANDARD COLOUR
YEAH
BUT STILL SILVER AND BLACK ARE WELL SILVER IS NEW BUT ALSO TRADITIONAL SO UH
YEAH W WHAT ABOUT A YELLOW THING I MEAN IT
COULD BE UGLY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY FANCY
MM-HMM
YEAH I WOULD THINK ABOUT COLOURS LIKE UH RED YELLOW GREEN BLUE JUST
YEAH
MM-HMM
MAROON
YEAH
OKAY SO
WHO'S PINGING
YOU ARE PINGIN OKAY
I THOUGHT WE OKAY SO UH THAT WRAPS IT UP
EVERYBODY KNOWS UH WHAT TO DO
WELL I WROTE IT DOWN HERE
I WROTE IT DOWN HERE WHAT TO DO UM
THE NEXT MEETING IS ONCE AGAIN IN THIRTY MINUTES
UM HERE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
AND ESPECIALLY NOTICE THAT UH THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE DRAWING ON A SMART BOARD
AND OF COURSE TO ALL FOUR OF US UH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE EMAILED BY OUR PERSONAL COACH
WELL I I'D SAY JUST WAIT UH FOR EMAIL AND UH FIND OUT
I DON'T KNOW
OKAY WELL THAT WAS WHAT I HAD TO SAY UH
FINAL THOUGHTS FROM ANYONE OR
WE'RE FINISHED
OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MM
ALRIGHT
HMM
IT'S A COLOUR
NO
YOU CAN PUT THE R. AND R.
ALRIGHT
I WILL GO NEXT
ALRIGHT SO I THOUGHT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE INTERFACE
UH HOW IT SHOULD LOOK
AND UH UH WE UH DETERMINED THAT WILL NOT BE NO BUTTONS BUT ONLY AN L. C. D. SCREEN SO I HAD TO UH LOOK ON THAT
AND THE DESIGN IS THEREFORE BASED ON WHAT WE JUST UH UH THOUGHT OF
UH FIRST THERE ARE SOME NEW FINDINGS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND THIS IS THAT UH UM UH UH YOU YOU ASK YOU GIVE A QUESTION THROUGH THROUGH THE DEVICE AND IT ANSWERS YOU
AND THEY ALREADY UH PUT THIS IN AN IN A COFFEE MAKER
AND SO THAT IT YOU SAY UH GOOD MORNING UH COFFEE MAKER AND IT SAYS T SAYS TO YOU BACK GOOD MORNING JOE OR WHAT'S YOUR NAME
THIS UH AND THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO UH PROGRAM THAT UH YOU SAY RECORD INTO THE DEVICE INTO THE SPEAKER AND THEN YOU SAY THE QUESTION AND THREE SECONDS LATER YOU SAY THE ANSWER AND THEN WHEN YOU SAY THE QUESTION IT GIVES YOU THE ANSWER
UM PERHAPS IT'S USEFUL PERHAPS FOR BECAUSE PEOPLE UM LOSE THE REMOTE THEY CAN YELL UH REMOTE WHERE ARE YOU AND CALLS OR SOMETHING
AND PERHAPS WE COULD UH IMPLEMENT THAT
AND THEN I HAVE TO GO OUT OF THE PRESENTATION BECAUSE I TRIED TO MAKE SOME KIND OF A A IDEA OF HOW IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I CAN'T DRAW
SO UH DON'T MAKE TOO MUCH OF IT
I TRIED TO UH THE L. C. D. SCREEN I TRIED TO SORT OF TO DRAW
I THOUGHT UH AT LEAST UH THE ICON FOR THE VOLUME
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS AN ICON FOR THE PROGRAM BUT YEAH
SO UH AND THEN THE BUTTONS ABOVE AND UH BELOW THE AND THE AND THE MUTE BUTTON ALSO RECOGNISABLE AS AN ICON
UM
I FORGOT THAT ONE
I THOUGHT I FORGOT SOMETHING BUT UH
AND UH AND UH THE NUMBERS THAT SHOULD BE A BIT LARGER I THINK IT'S NOT REALLY ON SCALE AND AND SO FORTH
UM AN OPTIONS BUTTON
AND I THOUGHT THE THE BUTTON FOR TELETEXT APAR UH APART BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY OPTIONS I THINK
IT'S UH OPTIONS IS THE SETTINGS OF THE REMOTE AND OF THE T. V. AND THAT KIND OF UH THING
SO COULD CALL IT SETTINGS OR SOMETHING
BUT THIS IS A BIT UH HOW I THOUGHT IT
AND UH THE L. C. D. UH SOMEWHERE ON THE REMOTE
PERHAPS WE COULD BE MORE CURVY THE REMOTE PERHAPS SHOULD
SO THAT IT'S BETTER IN YOUR HAND OR SOMETHING UH
BUT UH AND AND UH A MICROPH MICROPHONE FOR THE SPEECH UH RECOGNITION IF WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT THAT
UH AND THEN UH IF YOU PRESS THE OP OPTIONS BUTTON NOW WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF
AND THEN YOU SHOULD GET THE OTHER OPTIONS WITH WHAT WHAT YOU COULD DO AND THAT YOU COULD DO WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS THIS
AND UH IT'S ALSO UH I THOUGHT THINK WE DISCUSSED UH EARLIER THAT UH OLDER PEOPLE DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE UH THESE EXTRA SETTINGS
AND OLDER PEOPLE A ALSO DON'T REALLY WANT TO USE THIS UH TH THIS KIND OF OPTION MENUS
SO THEY WANT TO U USE ONE BUTTON AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS
AND NOT CHOOSE WITH UH THIS KIND OF UH AND YOU COULD PUT IN A AN A REALLY S LITTLE SCROLLING DEVICE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR UH REMOTE
SO YOU COULD SCROLL SCROLL UH ACROSS THESE UH THINGS
THAT'S AN OPTION
AND THAT WAS MY UH FINDING DINGE
YEAH
GRASS GREEN
LET'S BUILD IT INTO A SPONGE
IT WAS ONE REMOTE I THINK DIFFERENT COLOURS
YOU COULD YOU COULD UH CHANGE THE COLOURS THAT WAS ALSO THE IDEA
I DON'T KNOW WHICH SHAPE YOU SHOULD SHOULD TAKE BUT
YEAH
PERHAPS YOU COULD FIND SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE
ROUND BUT SQUARE
YEAH
UH I I IF YOU DO IT UH UH SQUARE
WITH ROUND CORNERS BUT A LITTLE UH IN THE MIDDLE OF IT UH I DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
WAIT LIKE LIKE THIS UH A BIT
SO IT'S A BIT SQUARE BUT IT'S ALSO A BIT UH
ROUND
SO BUT THEN
SAME SIDES
BUT THAT'S UH
YEAH BUT THAT'S ALSO HOW OTHER REMOTES ARE SHAPED SO THAT'S UH BUT PERHAPS THAT'S A GOOD THING SO THAT'S EASY TO USE
PEOPLE KNOW THE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SWORDS
YEAH
BUT THAT'S EASILY TO DO WITH THE COLOUR I THINK
THAT'S EASY TO DO WITH THE COLOURS I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THINK UH ALSO IN BETWEEN
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOULD IT BUT
YEAH
BIT LIKE THIS KIND OF RUBBER
THIS UH
BUT IT'S QUITE HARD THIS
YEAH
I DON'T THINK IT'S RUBBER
UH DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT UH
SO WE SHOULD FIRST DECIDE ABOUT SHAPE I THINK
WHICH UH THEN YOU CAN FIT THE L. C. D. SCREEN IN IT AND CAN DECIDE UH
YEAH IT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BIT S BIT S BIT YEAH
OOH
YEAH
BUT IF YOU PU NOW YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND THERE AND THEN YOU WON'T TOUCH THE SCREEN
PERHAPS THAT'S BEST
BUT NOT ON THE SCREEN BECAUSE YEAH THAT'S UH THAT'S AN IDEA
LOOKS A BIT LIKE A GAME BOY NOW
YOU ALWAYS TOUCH IT YEAH
YEAH
Y YOU COULD INCLUDE A PEN
YEAH O YEAH IF THEY THINK IT'S HANDY TO USE A PEN
YEAH I THINK THIS UH THIS IS A GOOD SIZE FOR THE SCREEN
I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW LARGE THE ACTUAL REMOTE SHOULD BE BUT A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS OR SOMETHING
YEAH
I THINK ENERGY WERE BATTERIES AND THEN UH AND UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
JUST LIKE WITH THE TELEPHONE
BUT IT SHOULD BE TH I THINK NORMAL BATTERIES NOT NOT LIKE TWO OR TWO UH
YEAH
YEAH
UM WHAT WAS WITH THE CHIP ON PRINT
YEAH
IT'S RUBBER
YEAH BUT BUT A HARD RUBBER LIKE THIS
OR SOFTER RUBBER OR YEAH
IT BOUNCES BACK FROM THE FLOOR WHERE YOU THROW IT
YEAH YEAH THIS IN DIFFERENT COLOURS
YEAH IT'S A BIT
BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE A BIT LONGER PERHAPS
YEAH
I THINK SO TOO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH ALRIGHT
AND THEN
YEAH YOU CAN UH IT'S PRETTY EASY BUT
AND
YEAH I HAD WHAT I JUST UH I SHOULD AGAIN
I MISS A FEW BUTTONS BUT
WELL
AT LEAST UH WHAT WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE ON I JUST REMEMBERED UM A MENU TO GO BACK THROUGH THE FIRST UH
IF IF YOU TOUCH OPTIONS YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO THIS UH RIGHT AWAY NOW
THIS
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK IT'S
I DON'T KNOW
I I THOUGHT IT WAS UH EASIER TO HANDLE THIS WAY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY THINK
WOULD YOU LIKE THE THE BUTTONS HORIZONTAL OR V VERTICAL
TH
RIGHT WELL IF WE MAKE IT LIKE THIS I THINK IF YOU
PUT IT LIKE THIS
YEAH
YEAH
BUT I THINK I WOU
I THINK THAT'S A MATTER OF WHAT YOU'RE USED TO
I THINK I WOULD PUT A PLUS AND A MIN UH HERE
AND THEN THE P. IN THE MID IN THE MIDDLE AND THE SOUND UH IN THE MIDDLE
ALMOST
YEAH BUT I THINK WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING IT YOU COULD PRESS THE MINUS AND THE PLUS AND WITH THE OTHER FINGER THE MINUS AND THE PLUS
YEAH BUT I THINK YEAH I DON'T KNOW
PERHAPS I HAVE SOME EXAMPLES
I DON'T KNOW
THAT'S ME
BUT I'M GOING TO LOOK IF I'VE GOT SOME EXAMPLES 'CAUSE PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CHOOSE WHAT'S MOST OFTEN USED
THE 'CAUSE THEY CAN USE THAT BETTER
YEAH
I
HERE IS OUR HERE ARE UH
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
YEAH
YEAH BUT BUT I MEAN IF IT'S USUALLY PLUS OR MIN ABOVE EACH OTHER OR NEXT TO EACH OTHER ON A NORMAL REMOTE
W WHAT'S WHAT'S USUAL OR NORMAL
YES I'M LOOKING HERE
BUT HERE'S IT'S BELOW HERE ALSO AND NOW HERE'S HERE'S NEXT TO EACH OTHER
I THINK IT'S IT'S A
YEAH
I THINK THE THE THE VOLUME WAS USUALLY UH ABOVE EACH OTHER BECAUSE YOU GO HIGHER AND DOWN
AND THE THE PAY THE THE THE PROGRAM IS NEXT TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE YOU WOULD GO FURTHER AND BACK
THAT'S HOW IT'S IS USUALLY WHEN I LOOK HERE
THAT'S WHAT I SEE
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
THIS CONCEPT IS IN THE ACTUAL DESIGN BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHERE YOU WOULD PLACE A
AND THE SPEECH UH SHALL WE IMPLEMENT THAT
OR UH
YEAH
BUT THEN YOU SHOULD ALSO FIND A PLACE YOU COULD IF YOU DO IT LIKE THIS YOU COULD PUT IT IN A CORNER OR SOMETHING
YOU CAN TALK INTO THE CORNER
YEAH
YEAH
BUT
YEAH THAT'S ALSO
SO IN THE MIDDLE OR SOMETHING
BUT YOU SHOULD UH DECIDE WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT IT
RIGHT
YOU COULD P YOU COULD PUT IT IN A LOGO OF THE COMPANY
YEAH
YEAH
SO WHERE DO YOU WANT TO PUT IT
YEAH ACTUALLY IT DOES BECAUSE IT YOU CAN YOU CAN FIND IT BETTER IF YOU USE IT
IT'S A WAY FOR YOU TO UH
SO IT MAKES MORE SENSE JUST 'CAUSE OTHER REMOTES DON'T HAVE THAT
ABOUT A MICROPHONE THERE IS NO BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
ANY MORE UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM YEAH
YEAH THE THE YOUNG PEOPLE DO LIKE UH SCROLL UH YEAH
OR AT LEAST YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S REALLY THE SCROLL BUT THE MENU THEY LIKE MOST
AND I THINK YOU CAN NEVER GET THROUGH A MENU GREAT WITH A SCROLL UH
BUT YOU HAVE IT'S F UH WE HAVE FIVE OR FOUR OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S ALSO DIFFERENT
YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD HAVE A BLACK ONE BECAUSE UH I THINK BLACK IS STANDARD
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT THEN UH
SILVER
SILVER RUBBER
BUT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
JUST ALL KIND OF COLOUR
YEAH
AND AND DO WE HAVE TO HAVE A NORMAL BLACK ONE OR UH
IS IT
YEAH
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT
OOH
RIGHT
YEAH
BUT DO WE HAVE TO WE'LL WORK TOGETHER BUT DO WE HAVE TO STAY HERE OR DO WE
RIGHT
YES
OKAY
YEAH I THINK
NO
YEAH
SO WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING ENGLISH NOW
W SURE
OKAY UH WELCOME YOU ALL
COMPONENTS DESIGN
UM UH FIRST OF ALL UH I WOULD LIKE TO UH UH ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THOSE UH THINGS I UH UH ELABORATE SOME OF THE THINGS I DID
I I ELABORATED ON THE CONCEPT
WHAT SHOULD BE UM
UH SAID ABOUT UH THE COMPONENTS UH ITS PROPERTIES AND WHAT KIND OF MATERIALS SHOULD WE USE TO UH TO MAKE UH ONE OF THOSE R REMOTE CONTROLS
UH WELL FIRST OF ALL I'VE UH D SUBTRACTED SOME OF THE COMPONENTS THAT IS THAT ARE USED UH ARE W W UM YOU KNOW FROM WHAT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL'S FORMED
UH FIRST OF ALL THE CASE THE CASE THE SURROUNDING OF THE OF THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
I WOULD LIKE TO UH GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF UH HOW I THOUGHT ABOUT
GIRAFFE'S GONE NOW
OKAY UM THE CASE WAS IS MADE FROM RUBBER I SUPPOSE
THERE'S ONE OF THE BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE A REMOTE CONTROL A LOT OF PEOPLE UH WILL UH WILL UH DROP THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AND THEY BREAK UH BECAU THE UH TITANIUM WAS ALSO AN OPTION
BUT UH IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE MATERIAL
UH RUBBER IS I THINK UH THE BEST SUITABLE UH MATERIAL UH TO USE UH FOR OUR UH
FOR OUR REMOTE CONTROL
UM IT'S POSS IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO UH CREATE FANCY COLOURS WITH RUBBER
UH RUBBER L MAKES IT EASY TO UH TO TO IT LETS LETS ITSELF COLOUR
UH TITANIUM UH YOU HAVE TO PAINT IT AND WITH THAT UH IT'S POSSIBLE TO SCRATCH IT OR UH YEAH MAKE IT UGLY
UH RUBBER UH THE TOTAL UH PIECE OF RUBBER THAT'S SOR UH THAT'S THAT'S USED UH TO MAKE THE CASE IS UH THE SAME COLOUR
SO IF YOU SCRATCH IT IT'S STILL THE SAME COLOUR PERHAPS UH IT'S A LITTLE BIT DAMAGED
BUT IT'S A VERY STRONG MATERIAL
UM I H I HAD AN IDEA SINGLE COVERED UH CURVED SORRY SINGLE CURVED
UH SO IT'S T TWO DIMENSIONAL
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S BEST TO DRAW OH GREEN
UH
NEW
BLANK
OKAY
LET'S MAKE IT UH BLACK
OKAY
I THOUGHT OF AN IDEA LIKE THIS
OH THAT
UM DELETE
BLANK
OKAY
SO IT ALSO LOOKS NICE WHEN IT'S ON YOUR TABLE
SO YOU GET UH IT DOESN'T LAY FLAT DOWN ON THE TABLE BUT IT'S C IT'S STANDS
SIDE VIEW YES IT'S SIDE VIEW SO UH I I'M NOT TECHNICALLY GOOD AT TH THREE D. MODELLING BUT
UM UH IT'S JUST AN IDEA I HAD SO IT'S UH IT'S VERY UH SO ITS ALSO LOOKS NICE WHEN IT'S ON THE TABLE
UM THE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE AND THE BUTTONS UH WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ALREADY
UH I THOUGHT ABOUT UH THE L. C. D. TOUCH SCREEN WHICH IS UH IS EASY TO CLEAN TOO
ONE OF THE GREAT UH ADVANTAGES OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU JUST USE SOME OR UH ANOTHER UH CLEANING UH UH CL SOME CLEANING STUFF
AND UM IT SHOULD BE MADE OF STRONG PLASTIC AND IT SHOULD BE BRIGHT
WELL I ALREADY UH S UH EXPLAINED SOME PROPERTIES OF THAT MATERIAL AND I THINK UH WELL WE ALSO WE ALMOST CONCLUDED ABOUT THAT UH THIS SHOULD UH BE UH OUR UH BUTTON COMPONENT
SO UH
UH THAT'S ALL ABOUT UH THE BUTTONS
UH THE BATTERIES UH WE ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ALREADY
UH WILL BE CHARGEABLE WITH UH UH AN OPTION FOR A MOUNT STATION SO YOU CAN UH PUT THE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL IN A MOUNT STATION SO ITS CHARGES ITSELF UP INSTEAD OF UH PLUGGING IT IN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
QUESTIONS
OKAY
AND THEY SHOULD BE LONG LASTING NOT UH NOT BE EMPTY UH IN ABOUT UH TWO MINUTES OR UH THIRTY MINUTES OR FORTY MINUTES OF USE
AND NEXT STEP IS THE CHIP UH TH THE COMPONENT THAT'S UH MAKES OR TRANSMITS THE SIGNAL TO THE TELEVISION
UH THERE WAS AN OPTION TO USE S A RATHER SIMPLE CHIP BUT I THINK UH BECAUSE UH OF OUR UH HIGHLY UH REQUIRING UH REQUIREMENTS
THERE SHOULD BE AN ADVANCED CHIP IN IT WITH UH ALSO THE ABILITY TO UH FACILITATE SPEAKER SPEECH RECOGNITION UH WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS STILL IN A TEST PHASE
SO UH THERE SHOULD BE SOME MORE UH INVESTIGATION ON THAT SIDE
UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES UH I ALSO OVERHEARD IN THE LAST MEETING THAT THERE SHOU WE SHOULD USE UH OUR OWN BUSINESS COLOURS
THAT WAS CORRECT WASN'T IT
OKAY
I THINK THEY ARE RATHER BORING FOR UM FOR USE WITH RUBBER
OKAY THEY SHOULD BE M SH THEY SHOULD BE IN MIND WASN'T IT
OKAY SO IT D IT DOESN'T SAYS UH TO UH HAVE THE SLOGAN
OKAY OKAY
WELL THAT'S POSSIBLE OF COURSE
WE COULD MAKE A LITTLE R. AND R. ON THE TOP OF THE MACHINE
UH SO THEY ARE PRETTY BORING I SUGGEST BECAUSE JUST THE AVAILABILITY WITH RUBBER TO MAKE FANTASTIC COLOURS UH AND ALSO IN A LOT OF POSSIBLE COLOURS
SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE VERY UH FANCY UH REMOTE CONTROLS WHICH PEOPL UH WHO PEOPLE
IN WHICH PEOPLE WILL FIND THEY'RE UH INTERESTING
AND UH WILL BUY UH THEM FASTER WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE SAME OLD GREY OR BLACK UH COLOURS
UH S AS I SAID UH BEFORE RUBBER IS UH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DAMAGE SEVERELY IMP INSTEAD OF UH OF COURSE YOU CAN BREAK IT WHEN YOU YOU WHEN YOU BREAK IT IN S FOR EXAMPLE WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT I IF YOU DROP IT IT'S NOT UH BROKEN UH RIGHT AWAY S INSTEAD OF USING UH PLASTIC HARD PLASTIC OR UH TITANIUM
AND I PERSONALLY LIKED UH THE SINGLE CURVED UH REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE IT YEAH IT MAKES SENSE
OKAY
WELL THAT'S ALL ABOUT MY UH MY FINDINGS
MM
MM
MM
OH MY GOD
NOT JUST A P.
OH OKAY
AH
MM-HMM
YEP
OH OKAY YEAH
OH YEAH
MM
OKAY
GO DANNY GO DANNY
FRUITY
FRUITY
MM
OKAY
MM
OKAY
CHANGING JUST THE SHAPE OF THE UH REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH S ROUND CORNERS BUT S BUT SQUARE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN KIND OF LIKE A
YEAH
KINDA LIKE A BEER GLASS
YEAH
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
IT'S ALSO EASY TO TO HAVE TO TO PUT IN YOUR HAND
YEAH
WILL RECOGNISE THAT'S AS A REMOTE CONTROL
UH WHEN I SAW YOUR D OH
HUH
YEAH KINDA LIKE OLD CARS UH
LET'S PUT IT ALL TOGETHER
UH
YEAH
SOFT RUBBER
YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU UM
IT SHOULD SHOULDN'T BE
UH
SPONGY
YEAH
DING DING
UM I ALSO S UH CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT YOU UH USED AN YOU HAD A REMOTE CONTROL AND THE L. C. D. SCREEN WAS UH RATHER SMALL
UM
THIS WAS YOUR SIZE BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE LARGER
YEAH THREE QUARTERS
SO UH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT YOUR OH
UH NEW BLANK
SO UH WHEN YOU GET THIS UH
UH KINDA LIKE THIS
OR SHOULD IT BE LARGER
LARGER
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR HANDS YOU WANT
YEAH
YOUR THUMB HERE
YEAH
BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT YOUR F YEAH BUT IF YO IF YOU MAKE THE THE L. C. D. SCREEN AS LARGE AS THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
UH YOU'LL YOU'LL ALWAYS GET SOME YOU YEAH
GOING TO BE VERY GREASY AND STUFF
YEAH YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO SMALL
HOW YEAH HOW LARGE
YEAH THEY HAVE THICK FINGERS
BUT IF YOU WANNA MAKE IT IN INTERNATIONAL JAPANESE UH PEOPLE GOT UH RATHER SMALL HANDS
AND WE GOT THESE LARGE
ZOOM OPT AH YEAH OF COURSE YEAH
YOU CAN MAKE IT LARGER TO TO UH TO UH WITH ACCOMPANYING UH GREATER FIELDS TO PUSH THE BUTTON
YOUR FINGERS YEAH
YOU DON'T WANT UH BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE THE PEN UH IF YOU LOSE THE PEN UH YOU CAN'T USE
YEAH YOU CAN DO WHATEVER UH ANY UH CLOTH
SURE
THE DOCKING STATION
W
YEAH
I KINDA LIKE YOUR
YEAH YOU GOT SOME UH SOME OF THOSE UH UH WIRELESS UH MICE
MOUSE
COMPUTER MOUSE
KINDA LIKE THOSE KIND OF BATTERIES
YEAH
THE CHIP ON PRINT
UM
UH YOU GOTTA F YEAH
I THINK SO
CHIP ON PRINT WITH A WITH A SIMPLE UH A SIM NOT A SIMPLE BUT A
WE ALSO DISCUSSED THAT
DIDN'T WE
UH
BEG YOUR PARDON
YEAH SURE OF COURSE YEAH
WELL UH CHIP ON PRINT I THINK WHAT THEY MEAN UH WITH THE REGULAR RUBBER BUTTONS THAT YOU GOT
UH IT'S ALWAYS CLEAR FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN YOU PRESS UH A CERTAIN BUTTON
BUT WHEN YOU GOT A L. C. D. SCREEN WITH NO UH WITH NOT THE BUTTONS ARE NOT ALWAYS ON THE SAME PLACE
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ENLARGE A BUTTON OR IF YOU GOT SEVERAL OPTIONS UH APPEARING ON YOUR SCREEN UH THE CO ORDINATIONS AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME
WHEN YOU GOT A REGULAR BUTTON TH THE BUTTON OF STAND BY IS ALWAYS ON THE SAME PLACE AND YOU GOT ON THE AND ON THE
YEAH
I SUPPOSE SO
IT IS A SIMPLE C. P. U. BUT IT DOESN'T
YEAH BECAUSE IT HAS TO UH B
YEAH BUT IT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE IN A SETTINGS MENU OR JUST UH YOU JUST WANT TO TURN UP THE VOLUME
SO IT HAS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A
CALCULATION UNIT OR C. P. U.
TO KNOW UH IN WHICH STATE YOU ARE AND UH WHICH BUTTON YOU ARE PRESSING IN AT THE RIGHT MOMENT
YEAH
AND A TOUCH SCREEN MAKES IT UH POSSIBLE TO UH TO GET THE CO ORDINATION OF YOUR FINGER ON THE SCREEN
AND THE CASE YEAH WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE CASE WE WANTED TO MAKE IT FROM RUBBER AND UH
UH HARD RUBBER I THINK
THAT'S THE EASY TO HA UH TO TO UH
YEAH
YEAH SURE LOOK
D
IT'S OUR MAIN TARGET
WELL AND HOW ABOUT MY IDEA UH OF MAKING IT UM
WITH ONE SINGLE CURVE
SO I
BECAUSE IT'S A GADGET AND YOU WANT TO SHOW IT OFF OF COURSE
UH
BECAUSE IT YEAH
YEAH
IT'S A LOT EASIER
SO SO YOU GOT UH DID YOU WRITE THAT DOWN
UH GOT A SINGLE CURVED UH RUBBER
F UH FANCY COLOURED REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
SORRY
DEPENDS ON THE SCREEN
IF YOU MAKE THE SCREEN VERTICAL IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU MAKE IT UH IN A RECTANGLE
I SO IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S
SQUARE
OH OKAY
UH
TAKE YOUR TIME
W
WE'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE USABILITY ENGINEERING THEN
YEAH
CONSISTENCY
YEAH
SO NOT HOW MUCH N NOT HOW OFTEN IT'S USED BUT
UH
YEAH IT DOES IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BUT
UH
OKAY UM
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE
OKAY WELL LE
YEAH
INTERFACE YEAH
TECHNOLOGIES UH
YEAH
MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO
MM
NOT EVEN NECESSARY BECAUSE A LOTTA YOU CAN MAKE A VERY SENSITIVE MICROPHONE
SO IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO UH JUST PUT IT AROU UH UNDERNEATH IT OR ON THE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE UH REMOTE
YEAH
RIGHT
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORT I THINK THAT'S NOT IM VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YEAH IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THE MICROPHONE IS
AH OKAY SURE OKAY WELL THA
UNDERNEATH
INDEED
IT SHOULDN'T BE UH VERY UH VISIBLE
YEAH SURE WHY NO
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T MAKES IT UH ANY MORE FANCY BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE UH
UH
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
WELL PUT IT THERE
I DON'T MIND
THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
OKAY
SO
INTERFACE TYPE
THE L. C. D. YEAH UH SUPPLEMENTS WELL THE SUPPLEMENT IS TO YEAH
HEY
USE THE SCROLL
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
SO WHY NOT ON ON SIDE
FAST YEAH
SO IF YOU'VE GOT A SETTINGS IF YOU
YES
YOU HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS
BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE YEAH YOU GET W WHEN YOU USE UH THE SETTINGS MENU FOR EXAMPLE TO LOOK UP SOME UH UH SOME CHANNELS ON YOUR UH ON YOUR TELEVISION
YOU SHOULD SCROLL SCROLL DOWN UH ON A MENU WHICH PROBABLY DOES NOT FIT ON YOUR SCREEN
SO THEN IT'S UH VERY HANDY TO TO SCROLL DOWN YOU MAKE JUST A RUBBER JUST LIKE UH ON YOUR MOUSE OR
JUST PUT IT ON THE SIDE AND IT'S VERY EASY TO USE
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY WHAT'S THE STANDARD COLOUR
I I YOU GOT YOU GOT DIFFERENT COLOURS BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE A STANDARD COLOUR
BLACK
WITH THE WITH THE YELLOW UH
JUST A REGULAR UH REMOTE COLOUR
AND THEN HAVE UH DIFFERENT COVERS UH TO USE
SILVER YEAH
YOU SEE A LOT OF T UH SILVER TELEVISIONS
YEAH Y I THINK IT'S BETTER TO
YEAH TH YEAH
THAT'S RIGHT
BUT IF YOU USE UH SILVER UH RUBBER S SILVER RUBBER ISN'T FANCY
WHEN YOU USE TITANIUM SILVER IS FANCY BUT WHEN YOU USE SILVER RUBBER IT ISN'T FANCY
SILVER HAS TO SHINE AND RUBBER DOESN'T SHINE
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S MADE OF SOFT RUBBER LIKE THIS
YOU UNDERSTAND
YEAH
FRUITY
FRUITY LOOPS
OKAY
YOU PING
WELL NOT WHAT TO DO
NOT WHAT TO DO
LOOK
OKAY
THIN I THINK WE SHOULD WORK
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
'KAY
DON'T DESTROY MY GIRAFFE
DROP IT
BRIGHT COLOUR
FANCY COLOUR
FORWARD
YOU HAVE TO GO T
OH IT'S A SIDE VIEW
TRUE
NO NO NO NO NO
JUST LOOKING
MM MM MM
NEXT
IT'S TRUE
P. YEAH JUST A P.
WHERE'S WHERE'S THE BUTTON FOR TWO
OKAY
DOESN'T MATTER
NO
OKAY
OKAY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT A TREND WATCHING
THE TRENDS FROM THE PAST YEARS WHAT THE PEOPLE LIKE WHAT THE YOUNGSTERS LIKE WHAT THE ELDERLY PEOPLE LIKED ABOUT SHAPES COLOURS
MATERIAL AND STUFF
'KAY
THE METHOD I USED WAS
LIKE I TOLD I WATCHED THE TRENDS FROM THE PAST YEARS ABOUT COLOURS SHAPES MATERIAL THEY WANTED UH FROM ELDERLY AND YOUNG PEOPLE
SO WE CAN KEEP THAT IN MIND FOR DESIGNING F UH THE DEVICE ITSELF
FINDINGS I MADE
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING PEOPLE LIKED LAST YEAR WAS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE LOOK LOOK FANCY
THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING THAT W SHOULD BE IF INV IN INNOV INNOVATIVE OKAY
LIKE THE L. C. D. SCREEN THAT'S QUITE INNOVATIVE SO THAT SHOULD BE GREAT MEETING FOR THIS
AND THE THIRD THING IS IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
I THINK WITH ONLY ONE MENU FOUR BUTTON CHANNEL VOLUME IT SHOULD ALSO BE ENOUGH FOR EASY TO USE
THE PERSONAL PREFERENCES FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE THEY LIKED FRUITY COLOURS LIKE UH BANANA YELLOW UH STRAWBERRY RED AND STUFF
YEAH
LIKE THAT
THE ROUND SHAPES
AND SOFT MATERIAL M MATERIALS LIKE THE RUBBER
IT SHOULD BE SOFT UH I IT SHOULD FEELING SPONGY OR S SPONGE BOB LIKE THINGS
TH
ELDERLY PEOPLE LIKE AU COLOURS WHICH Y ARE BEING SEEN IN AUTUMN LIKE UM WOODS UM DARK BROWN RED DEEP REDS AND STUFF
THEY LIKED SQUARE SHAPES WITH ROUND EDGES
AND HARD MATERIALS LIKE WOOD UM TITANIUM
THEY THOSE KIND OF MATERIALS THEY LIKED
THIS IS A BIT LIKE THE YOUNG PEOPLES LIKE THE FRUITY COLOURS
INNOVATIVE ALL THE COLOURS YOU SEE THE BLUE THE RED THE WHITE THE YELLOW THAT STUFF
AND THEN I TH I I PERSONALLY THOUGHT THE FRONT SIDE OF THE SHAPE SHOULD BE SOMETHING FOR THE YOUNGSTERS LIKE LIKE
THIS OR SOMETHING
IT'S IT'S A BIT LIKE A BANANA
AND THE COLOUR SHOULD BE YELLOW OR SOMETHING
AND FOR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE JUST PLAIN OLD
BECAUSE WE DECIDED TO HAVE TWO KIND OF REMOTES TWO DESIGNS OR WAS IT TWO COLOURS
DIFFERENT COLOURS YEAH
WE SHOULD DECIDE WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE WITH ROUND SHAPES
I THINK LIKE MY COLLEAGUE YOU SAID IS THAT'S E BETTER OR FOR THE ELDERLY PEOPLE SOMETHING LIKE LIKE THE IPOD OR SOMETHING WITH ROUND SQUARES
SIMPLE BUT
EASY TO USE
SO THAT'S IT
THAT IS MY
YEAH LIKE THE OLDER O OLDER COLOURS I CAN MAYBE
YEAH
COLOURS TH THE ELDERLY PEOPLE
UH
LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AUTUMN COLOURS LIKE RED BROWN
THEY LIKED THE WOOD A LOT
SO MAYBE WE COULD GIVE IT LIKE WOODEN LOO LOOK LOOK OR SOMETHING IN THAT COLOUR
AND A BIT BIT OLD SCHOOL STYLE RENAISSANCE MEDIEVAL KIND OF THINGS
THOSE KIND OF YEAH THOSE KIND OF THINGS
SO YOU SEE THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE
FRESH EXCITING
AND THE OLD PEOPLE OLD AND BORING
SO SORRY
YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S EASIER TO DO IN COLOUR THAN IN SHAPE
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE HAVE TO GET DIFFERENT SHAPES AND COLOUR WAY EASIER THAN YEAH THE SHAPES
IN MATERIAL YEAH RUBBER RUBBER IS LIKE I SAID YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE MORE SOFT MATERIALS AND SPONGY ONES AND THE OLD PEOPLE LIKE PLAIN WOOD
SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE IF WE'RE GOING TO USE
REAL HARD RUBBER OR SOFT RUBBER
OR SOMETHING SOMETHING BETWEEN THAT
YEAH SOFT RUBBER WHICH YOU CAN YOU CAN FEEL IN IT
OR NO
OR OR WH WHAT'S SOMETHING HARDER
NO NO NO BUT BUT YOU HAVE TO LIKE LIKE LIKE A A ERASER OR SOMETHING
THAT'S THE BIT YOU CAN PRESS IT IN OR SOMETHING HARDER
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THIS YEAH
YEAH IT'S QUITE HARD BUT YOU CAN PRESS IT IN
IT'S FEELS KIND S SPONGY
SOMETHING
NO
N N N
ARE YOU GOING TO INVITE SPONGE BOB MAYBE HE CAN
YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE BETTER THING TO DO
YEAH W I THINK THAT L. C. D. SCREEN SHOULD BE LIKE
YEAH THREE QUARTER OF THE OF THE
YEAH THE BUTTONS WON'T GET THAT SMALL WHEN THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS
MM-HMM
LARGER I THINK
YEAH BECAU BECAUSE YOU HAVE
YEAH OKAY TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT IT WON'T GET THAT SMALL BECAUSE YOU HAVE HOW MUCH
NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN
ONE TO ZERO THE TWO DIGIT
YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO BECAUSE SOME FAT PEOPLE WITH D THICK FINGERS WILL PRESS THREE BUTTONS AT SAME TIME
YEAH TRUE BUT YEAH WE HAVE WE HAVE THE ZOOM OPTION RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
NO
YEAH
YEAH
USE A PEN YOU YOU C YOU CAN LOSE THE PEN
YEAH THE FINGERS YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT THAT CAN BE WITH PLAIN SOFT TISSUE
YEAH YOU CAN BUY THOSE AT
MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO TO INCLUDE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES WHICH YOU CAN RECHARGE THROUGH THE DOCKING STATION
SO IF THE BADG THE BATTERIES ARE DEAD
THEN YOU CAN RE YOU CAN UH CHANGE THEM
YEAH YEAH YEAH LIKE THOSE
YEP
YEAH NORMAL PLAIN YOU NO NORMAL PLAIN BATTERIES YOU CAN BUY AT THE SUPERMARKET OR RETAIL SHOP
YEAH
PRINT PLATE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PRINT PLATE
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PRINT PLATE RIGHT
ALWAYS SO
I DUNNO WHAT W WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT
YEAH OKAY
BUT
YEAH OKAY BUT THE P PRINT PLATE OF L. L. C. D. SCREEN IS MORE ADVANCED THAN A NORMAL PRINT PLATE
SO THAT THAT'S NOT OF ANY DISCUSSION I THINK
MM I DON'T I DUNNO I DON'T THINK THAT'S
YEAH YEAH OKAY BUT I D I I DON'T KNOW IF NOR O S IT'S QUITE A SIMPLE L. C. D.
YEAH IT'S QUITE A SIMPLE L. C. D. SCREEN
I THINK THEY DON'T NEED THAT BIG OF C. P. U.
YEAH OKAY TRUE TRUE
TRUE
YEAH
WE HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS
SO THE SHAPES IS SOMETHING BETWEEN THE SQUARE SHAPES WITH ROUND COLO CORNERS AND A ROUND SHAPES
NO I DON'T THINK I THINK
IT'S MORE ROUND THAN SQUARE
SO IT MEETS I THINK IT MEETS MORE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAN THE OLDER PEOPLE
YEAH THAT'S OUR TARGET
YEAH
LOWER THAN FORTY YEARS I THINK
IT WAS
OH YEAH THAT THAT I THINK I THOUGHT THAT WAS A QUITE GOOD
YEAH
YOU CAN PUT IT ON YOUR TABLE WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT GET IT IN YOUR HAND
YOU CAN PUT IT NEXT TO YOU AND THEN DIVE IT IN AND
YEAH
SO
YOU CAN'T YOU YOU CAN'T OH YOU C YOU CAN DRAW IT ON YOUR PAPER AND THEN LOAD IT ON THE
AND LOAD IT ON THE THE USER THE SERVER
MM-HMM
YEAH YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
YEAH UH UH
ISN'T IT BETTER TO HAVE THE SOUND AND THE GENERAL BUTTONS HORIZONTAL
WITH THE MINUS AND THE PLUS
I THINK IT'S
EASIER THAN
YEAH
FOR SOUND AND CHANNEL
YEAH
I THINK IT'S IT'S EASIER TO HAVE IT SOMETHING LIKE
OH A BUTTON UH MINUS HERE PLUS OVER HERE
A MINUS HERE PLUS OVER HERE
AND ON HERE
THE OTHER BUTTONS AND ON HERE THE TOP
THE OPTIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE UH THE P. OVER HERE
AND THE SOUND
SOMETHING UH
SOMETHING LIKE
SH
PLUS MINUS PLUS UH
MINUS
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO S YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT WITH ONE THUMB
WHO'S THE USABILITY ENGINEERING
SHE IS
OH
UM
OH I HAVE THAT THOSE S NUMBERS
OR A GOOD WATCH
B
CHANNEL SELECTION
PER HOUR ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT
VOLUME SELECTION FOUR TIMES AN HOUR
UH
YEAH THAT DEPENDS ON ON ON THE REMOTE
I THINK BECAUSE I HAVE TWO TELEVISIONS AT HOME
ONE IS HORIZONTAL ONE IS VERTICAL SO IT DEPENDS
YEAH
DEPENDS
YEAH LOWER
TRUE
IT'S GOT TO CHANGE
YEAH IS IT IS USER INTERFACE
COMPONENT
YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S EASY FOR THAT WHERE ARE YOU BUT THEN IT SAYS I'M HERE
YEAH
YEAH A MICROPHONE YEAH
UM I THINK WHERE IT ISN'T SEEN
THE MOST
INSIDE
YEAH
I I BETWEEN THE ROUND OF THE R.
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH BU BUT
I THINK THE LEFT S UNDER CORNER SHOULD BE THE BEST
WHERE ISN'T I IT ISN'T MOST IN SIGHT
I THINK
NO
ACTUALLY DOESN'T
I THINK I THOUGHT THE LIKE YOU SAID LIKE SCROLL NEXT TO THE REMOTE ISN'T THAT HANDY
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO JUST UP WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO ON THE SCREEN
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK YOU HAVE TO BACK BUTTON GO BACK
IF YOU WANT TO CHOOSE AUDIO SETTINGS YOU PRESS AUDIO SETTINGS AND IT GOES TO THAT S SUB MENU
YEAH
YOU DO LIKE IT
YEAH I THINK IT IS IS FASTER
BECAU I THINK THE SCROLL'S EASIER IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTION THEN
Y
UH-HUH
YEAH OKAY TRUE
OKAY
OKAY NO PROBLEM
OKAY
UM
NO COLOURS ARE CLEAR SHAPE IS CLEAR MATERIAL IS CLEAR
AND A STANDARD YEAH WE DON'T NO WE HAVE DIFFERENT COLOUR
HOW MANY COLOURS ARE WE GOING TO

SO WELL UH WELCOME EVERYONE
UM AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED I UH
CREATED SEPARATE FOLDERS BECAUSE IT WAS UH TENDING TO GET A LITTLE BUSY IN OUR UH SHARED PROJECT DOCUMENTS UH FOLDER
I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYBODY UH PUT THEIR OWN UH DOCUMENTS IN THE RIGHT FOLDER WHICH IS FOR NOW THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
YEAH
THEN I'LL MOVE THIS ONE
OH NO THIS IS JUST ONE BIG DOCUMENT SO YOU CAN LEAVE THAT WHEREVER IT IS
AND WE HAVE A EVALUATION LEFT HERE
OKAY
WELL NOT MAIN DOCUMENTS THIS TIME
OH UH YES
I HAVE IT OPEN MYSELF I GUESS
UM WELL THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING HUH
WE'RE FINALLY GETTING SOMEWHERE HOPEFULLY
UM WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
I'VE OPENED IT ALREADY
UM I'M STILL GOING TO TAKE SOME MINUTES AND IF I'M RIGHT YOU TWO ARE GOING TO GIVE A PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
AREN'T YOU
YES YOU ARE
AND UH M DID YOU DO SOMETHING WITH EVALUATION CRITERIA
GOOD
AND WE HAVE A CORRECT AGENDA
AND UH THEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING WHICH IS LESS NICE THE FINANCE UH ASPECT WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD WHAT WE HAVE DESIGNED
AND IF WE CAN WE CAN UH COMMENCE THE FINAL PART WHICH IS THE PRODUCTION OR PROJECT EVALUATION
HOW DID WE WORK TOGETHER AND WHAT ARE THE RESULTS AND HOW HAPPY ARE WE WITH THOSE
OKAY WELL FINANCE UH WILL BE LATER
NOW I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE WORD TO YOU TWO
SO A SEPARATE BUTTON FOR FOR TEXT OKAY
MM-HMM
THANK YOU
LOOKS GOOD
AND I JUST MISSED WHEN I WAS TYPING THE R. R. STANDS FOR
LOGO OKAY
OKAY WELL
I WOULD HAVE RECOGNISED IT IF IT WERE THE RIGHT COLOURS OF COURSE
OKAY THE EVALUATION CRITERIA HUH
WELL IT'S LOOKS FANCY ESPECIALLY WITH THE GREEN COLOUR
AND THE THE CURVES WHICH WE DECIDED HUH
ONLY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SINGLE CURVE
WE SPOKE ABOUT LAST MEETING
WELL IT MIGHT WORK ONE TIME HUH
OKAY
OKAY BUT WE HAVE TO RATE UH THESE THINGS NOW
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL I THINK UH ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE MICROPHONE AND THE L. C. D. SCREEN ALSO
VERY NEW THING
WELL
FANCY THE OLD PEOPLE WILL
NO IT'S A TWO
LITTLE BIT STRANGE WE HAVE TO JUDGE THAT OURSELVES HUH
WELL I'D SAY TWO ON A SCALE
NO OKAY WELL THAT'S TRUE
OKAY ONE TWO
THAT DOESN'T MATTER THAT MUCH SO MAKE IT A ONE
YEAH M
YEAH AND YOU USE THESE BUTTONS THE MOST HUH
SO
SO WHICH
SO WHICH NUMBER ARE WE GOING TO FILL IN
A TWO YEAH
TWO THREE AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
OKAY SO WE HAVE TWO TWO THREE
A TWO OKAY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO
IT'S THE BOX BELOW IT HUH
OTHERWISE WE HAVE TWO RESULTS IN ONE QUESTION
OKAY NEXT QUESTION
OKAY YOU'RE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT YOUR OWN DESIGN HUH
AS WELL FOR THE FOR THE OLDER PEOPLE
AND WOULD IT BE EASY FOR THEM TO USE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
BECAUSE THAT MIGHT YEAH
OKAY WELL
M MAYBE THAT'S THE MOST USER FRIENDLY AND EASY TO USE
YEAH WELL MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE IT EVEN MORE EASY TO USE FOR THEM
I'D SAY THREE
OKAY SO WE HAVE THREE THREE TWO TWO OR
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
OKAY A THREE I SEE
UH
ANOTHER QUESTION
NO
YEAH
YEAH BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE IT ONE SCALE WITH WITH ONE BEING GOOD AND SEVEN BEING BAD
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CAN'T UH CALCULATE ANYTHING FROM THE RESULTS SO
OKAY A ONE BECAUSE WE DESIGNED FOR THAT HUH
YEAH
YEAH AND I THOUGH W WE HAD ABOUT SINGLE COLOURS BUT YOU CAN ALSO MAKE UH A WOOD COLOUR
NOT JUST ONE SINGLE COLOUR BUT A WOOD LIKE THING CAN'T YOU
WHETHER IT LOOKS LIKE WOOD IT ISN'T W IT ISN'T WOOD BUT
YOU CAN MAKE A PRINT ON RUBBER CAN'T YOU
YEAH
SO THAT'S A ONE THEN HUH
DO YOU HAVE MANY QUESTIONS
OH OKAY WELL
YEAH BUT WE HAVE WE ALSO WE HAVE TO GET TO THE MONEY
WHAT SPONGY
UH-HUH YEAH
YEAH SO ISN'T HARD TO LOSE YOU
YEAH BUT A HAR
A HARD TO LOSE IS GOOD
SO IT SHOULD THIS QUESTION SHOULD BE HARD TO LOSE
IT'S DIFFICULT TO LOSE IT
A TWO
A TWO
OKAY
YEAH IT'S OKAY
THAT HAPPENS ABOVE ALSO
BUT MAYBE WHEN YOU SCROLL AWAY AND BACK IT WILL BE NORMAL BUT
YEP
OH IT ISN'T WELL OKAY
REMEMBER
THERE
WELL I THINK IT'S IT'S UH A LOWER NUMBER SO BETTER BECAUSE W WE DESIGNED IT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY DIDN'T WE
WHAT DO YOU THINK
QUESTIONS
TWO
UH-HUH
DISSATISFY YOUNGER PEOPLE
UM
YEAH BUT THOSE ARE MORE FANCY FUNCTIONS NOT NOT REALLY MANY FEATURES OR SOMETHING
IT HAS RELATIVELY FEW FEATURES WITH
YEAH
OURS HAD OTHER FEATURES WITH
OKAY YOU THINK ONE WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU
THREE YEAH
I'D SAY THREE SO TWO IT IS THEN OR
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE MAYBE TWO
WELL M TH BUT THE LOGO IS ON ON THE FRONT SO A TWO YEAH THAT'S
OH WELL THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY GOOD HUH
THAT WAS YOUR EVALUATION UH SHOW OKAY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO CALCULATE ANYTHING BECAUSE OF UM THESE RESULTS
OKAY GOOD
UM LET'S SEE OH IT ISN'T ASKED TO SAVE BUT IT DID ALREADY
AND THIS
EVERYTHING OKAY
WELL THE NEXT PART UH MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT
DIFFICULT TO DO
IN A GROUP BUT I AM WILLING TO TRY IT
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THE FINANCE AND I HAVE A NICE EXCEL SHEET TO DO THAT
AND UM I'M NOT SURE IF I PUT IT IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
LOOK ON THAT
UM AND WE'RE GOING TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COSTS AND IF THEY ARE UH UNDER OR AT TWELVE EURO FIFTY
WE'RE GOOD AND IF THEY'RE NOT WE'RE GOING TO UH RE DESIGN BUT WE HAVE TO DO THAT UH VERY VERY QUICK I THINK YES
UM I DON'T KNOW IF I
PUT THE EXCEL SHEET IN THE
N NOT IN THE
FOLDER
I THINK IT'S
I THINK IT'S STILL IN MY OWN DOCUMENTS FOLDER
OH SHIT
SO
OKAY WELL THIS IS IT
UM MAYBE I COULD ASK ONE OF YOU TO UH FILL IT IN SO THAT I CAN ALSO UH TAKE MINUTES
AND UH MAYBE THE OTHER CAN UH USE THAT THING TO COUNT UH NUMEROUS FUNCTIONS
WELL WE HAVE TO COUNT SOME THINGS AND WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SOME THINGS
BUT YOU HAVE TO FILL IN THIS COLUMN HUH
NO UH COUNT UH NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS BECAUSE FOR EVERY BUTTON YOU HAVE TO PAY AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT SCREEN SHOTS
SO OR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT SCREENS SO
YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S MORE ABOUT THE ENERGY SOURCE HUH
DO YOU USE A HAND DYNAMO A BATTERY KINETIC OR SOLAR CELLS
WE'LL WAIT
YEAH
I'LL JUST FILL IT IN
UM RUBBER INDEED
YEAH I THINK THAT WILL BE
OUR BEST BET
AND WHAT DID YOU CHANGE
YOU CHANGED THE UH SCROLL WHEEL AND
OH BUT IT'S JUST ONE
POINT SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD SHOULD UH
YEAH YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD DROP THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
AND THEN YOU CAN KEEP THE CURVE
OR CAN'T YOU
OR MAKE IT ON A HAND DYNAMO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WILL WORK
YEAH MM-HMM
YEAH BUT UH A WOODEN REMOTE CONTROL ONLY HELPS FOR UH OLD PEOPLE WE DISCUSSED YES
YEAH BUT IT'S ONLY A HALF
BUT I THINK THE ONLY OPTION IS TO DROP THE UH SAMPLE SPEAKER
YEAH BUT ISN'T IT PER REMOTE THAT YOU PAY
HALF
I THINK YOU PAY HALF PER REMOTE
SO EACH REMOTE WITH A SPECIAL COLOUR
I HOPE
SO THE BATTERY WE HAVE UM ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
BECAUSE OF THING YEAH WELL YOU CAN AT LEAST MAKE IT CURVED AGAIN
BECAUSE THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT HUH
SO IT'S CURVED IT'S STILL THAT SO WE WE DROPPED THE SPEECH RECOGNITION TOGETHER WITH THE SPEAKER
WE DROPPED THE SCROLL WHEEL
AND THE REST IS THE SAME HUH
AM I RIGHT
YES
NO BUT YOU C YEAH
OKAY BUT THIS THIS NEW REMOTE WE CAN AFFORD
HMM
NO I HADN'T
I JUST RECEIVED IT
THEY DON'T WORK SO HARD AT THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT
YEAH AND THAT'S IT
TWELVE EURO FIFTY
UM AND DID YOU TRY TO MAKE A NEW DESIGN OR WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO
IT DIDN'T WORK
HMM
STRANGE
OH YOU CAN ARRANGE
HMM CAN'T YOU THEN JUST SAY COPY
NEW PAGE
PASTE
YES
SELECT NONE
OKAY AND NOW YOU CAN ERASE
WELL IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
OH NO
WELL YOU CAN DRAW OVER IT WITH WHITE UH PEN
OH
YEAH
SORRY
WELL BUT THAT'S ALSO USEFUL FOR THE EVALUATION
BECAUSE I THINK UH WE HAVE A PROTOTYPE NOW WHICH WE CAN AFFORD AND UH WE ONLY NEED TO DRAW A LITTLE BIT TO GET A GOOD UH
DESIGN
DOODLE
AND I THINK WE SHOULD THEN MOVE ON TO THE PRODUCTION EVALUATION BECAUSE OF THE TIME
LET'S SEE WE CAN SAVE THIS NOW
AND MOVE BACK TO HERE
MM-HMM
AND THEN ALL GREEN
OKAY WELL THANK YOU
OH NO
HEY BUT YOU CAN ERASE THAT
UH OH
RIGHT
AND YOU CAN'T ERASE THIS
HMM STRANGE
OKAY WELL UH JUST LEAVE IT AT THIS AND QUICKLY SAVE
UM AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO THE PROJECT OR PRODUCT EVALUATION
WE JUST DID OUR PROJECT EVALUATION
UM WELL I THINK I CAN SIT FOR THAT SINCE IT'S ALMOST MY FINAL SLIDE
UM
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT UH THE PROCESS
HOW SATISFIED ARE WE
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
AND YOU COULD ASK THINGS
AND FOR ME IT SOMETIMES WAS A SURPRISE WHO WAS GOING TO PRESENT WHAT HUH
AND UH
YEAH
SO YOU WOULD SAY UH COMMUNICATE DURING OUR INDIVIDUAL UH WORK

NO
SO YOU DON'T THINK THE SMARTBOARD IS IS REALLY USEFUL OR
YEAH SO IT'S MAYBE A BIT UNNATURAL ALSO
THAT WASN'T ME
UH SO UM THE MEANS WE DISCUSSED THE SMART BOARD AND WHAT ABOUT UH THIS DIGITAL PEN
YEAH WELL I USE IT AS A A NORMAL PEN AND AND AND ONLY YOU USE IT TO UH GET IT ON THE COMPUTER HUH

UM OKAY WELL UH I JUST GOT MY WARNING FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES
SO I'LL MOVE ON TO I GUESS MY LAST SLIDE YES WHICH IS THE CLOSING
WELL UH WE MANAGED BUT WE DID IT VERY QUICKLY
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO WHEN IT ISN'T IS IT WHEN IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE TO QUICKLY RE ARRANGE IT AND SAY OKAY
THIS IS IT BUT WE HAD TO DO IT HUH BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A DESIGN AND THAT IS WITHIN THE BUDGET
AND WE EVALUATED
MAYBE WE SHOULD RE EVALUATE UH THE PRODUCT BUT WE DID THAT BEFORE AND WE ALSO EVALUATED THE PROJECT

WELL UH WE MADE A PROTOTYPE
WE FIRST START WITH THE OVERALL UH
THIS IS ABOUT THE TOTAL REMOTE CONTROL
WE MADE IT GREEN
YEAH
IT'S A FRESH COLOUR
AND UH THE SCREEN LIGHT BLUE
OH UH THIS THE SCROLL BUTTON AND THE MICROPHONE ON THE ON THE SIDES HERE UNDER
AND THE R. AND R. LOGO IT JUST SAYS R. AND R. NOW BUT UH
ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR
YEAH
YEAH
OH Y YOU PERHAPS YOU SHOULD MAKE IT A BIT BIG SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S THERE AND UH
UH
HMM
YOU PUSH THE SCROLL BUTTON AND IT'S CLAPS OUT IF THERE'S A
REMOTE SETTINGS ET CETERA
YEAH
YEAH
AND YOU COULD ALSO TOUCH IT SO THAT IT COMES OUT AND AND USE THE THE THE SCROLL THING AS A WITH YOUR FINGERS
YES
YEAH
YEAH
PERHAPS WE SHOULD USE THE TELETEXT SIGN IN P YEAH
YEAH
FORGOT
UH WELL THIS IS THE TOTAL INTERFACE UH THAT F OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN
UH THE NUMBERS WHICH IS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD
WE PUT ANO AN AN EXTRA BUTTON IN
WE CAN ERASE IT BUT IT'S THE BUTTON WHERE YOU CAN SWITCH CHANNELS
JUST WHEN YOU ARE ONE AND YOU GO TO TWO YOU CAN OR IF YOU GO TO FIVE YOU CAN GO BACK TO ONE WITH THAT BUTTON
YEAH THAT ONE YEAH
IT HAS A NAME
AND UH UH WE PUT THAT IN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HANDY THERE
UH THIS THE ONE NUMBER OR TWO NUMBERS BUTTON
BELOW THAT THE PAGE AND THE SOUND
AND UH IN THE MIDDLE THE THE MUTE
UH BATTERY INDICATOR
IT'S IT'S A BIT BIG
AND THIS IS THE UH THE ON OFF UH KNOP THE STAND BY UH KNOP
OR AT LEAST IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE IT

SO IF YOU V FLIP IT LIKE THIS
HERE'S YEAH
YEAH
SO YOU JUST MAKE THE BACK OF THIS PART A BIT BIGGER SO THAT IT LAYS A BIT O
YEAH THAT'S A BIT OF PROBLEM MAYBE
YEAH
I THINK YEAH THE BATTERY SHOULD BE IN HERE BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOTHING SO IF YOU COULD
YEAH
'CAUSE OTHERWISE I THINK I
I THINK IT DOES
I IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT GREEN THEN THE ELDER PEOPLE WON'T WON'T LIKE IT
YEAH
I THINK IT DOES
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OLDER PEOPLE WILL USE IT BUT
I WOULD MAKE IT A TWO OR SOMETHING
YEAH
HUH
ALRIGHT IT'S A ONE
OH IT'S A ONE
YEAH
BUT IT'S A ONE UH MAYBE UH
YEAH
WELL THEY THINK IT'S VERY TRUE BUT UH
YEAH BUT
WE SHOULD PERHAPS
THAT NOT

I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IT HAS AN L. C. D. SCREEN A MI MICROPHONE
IT'S FROM RUBBER
YEAH
IT'S A ONE I THINK
YEAH BECAUSE THEY'RE RIGHT ON YOUR SCREEN
SO YOU CAN USE THE B THE THE ARROWS
THEY'RE RIGHT ON YOUR SCREEN SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'D SEARCH

THE OPTIONS ARE IT UH LITTLE BIT HARDER BUT IF YOU TOUCH THE OPTIONS THEN IT'S UH
NO THEY'RE NOT BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY ARE EASY TO FIND
OH
YEAH
I WOULD SAY YEAH

WHAT DID
YEAH
WELL THAT IT DOESN'T
YEAH BU BUT
I THINK THEY LIKE THE SPEECH
YOU COULD CALL TO YOUR UH YEAH AND THE SCREEN YEAH
RIGHT THAT THAT THAT THOSE ARE FEATURES
NO AREN'T THE FEATURES THE MICROPHONE'S FEATURE AND THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE CHANNEL'S FEATURE
AND THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE VOLUME IS FEATURE AND THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE OPTIONS OF THE REMOTE UH UH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
THOSE ARE FEATURES
ENOUGH FEATURES
YEAH
I THINK TWO OR THREE
YEAH
YEAH UH A TWO A TWO
JUST ANOTHER TWO
WE LIKE TWO
YEAH THERE'S R. AND R. IN FRONT
UH IT'S NOT THE COLOUR SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD MAKE TWO BUT IT HAS R. AND R.
YEAH
YEAH BUT NOT R. AND R. YELLOW I THINK
ONE D ON I IT'S THE COLOURS AND THE
I THINK IT IS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
AND YOU CAN NAVIGATE EASIER BECAUSE WI WITH THE YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE THE THE ARROWS AND WITH A NORMAL T. V. UH REMOTE
YEAH
LET'S MAKE A DIFFERENT REMOTE
WELL
MENU
A TWO
WE ONLY HAVE TWOS
UH JUST TWOS
ONE THREE AND A FEW ONES
TWO THREES
WE M MOSTLY HAVE TWOS SO IT'S PRETTY GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK SO TOO

A FLY YEAH
A F BUTTERFLY
YEAH
THAT'S IT

IT'S GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
REDESIGN

DO YOU HAVE THE COST OR UH
LET'S HOPE
WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK
WE'RE GOIN STILL GOING TO BE HERE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK
I DOUBT IT
PERHAPS WE'VE GOT FEATURES THAT DON'T EXIST IN THE EXCEL SHEET
NO IT WAS IN MY UH MY INFORMATION SO UH
YEAH
WELL IF IT DOESN'T WORK
I WANT TO FILL IT IN BUT UH
BUT YOU SHOULD UH DIRECT
THE NUMBER OF
WE'VE GOT A BATTERY ONE OR T TWO BATTERIES OR NOT
NEE ONE BATTERY WITH TWO SMALL BATTERIES
YEAH
I WOULD DO A BATTERY WE DO
RIGHT
A BATTERY
ONE BATTERY RIGHT
ELECTRONICS SIMPLE CHIP ADVANCED CHIP RIGHT
YEAH SO THIS ONE AND THIS ONE
UH WE HA WE HAVE UM SINGLE WHAT
ARE WE
OH YAY
THE SINGLE
OH THE THE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK UH PEOPLE
WE HAVE RUBBER
THIRTEEN
WITH A SCROLL WHEEL RIGHT
IS HE INTEGRATED
NO EH
I DON'T KNOW
OH YEAH RIGHT WE WANT IT TO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT NO
YEP
FIFTEEN OH TOO BAD
OH BUT WITH SPECIAL COLOUR WE HAVE
A SPECIAL FORM RIGHT
OH WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS SO YEAH WE NEED TO UH
NO UH WE HAVE FIFTEEN AND OH RIGHT
WE COULD LOSE THE CURVE
YEAH I WOULD LOSE THE CURVE
BUT YOU CAN'T PUSH IT SO YOU HAVE TO TAP
YEAH ALRIGHT
SO NORMAL SCROLL WHEEL
AND I THINK WE SHOULD LOSE THE CURVE
YEAH BUT IF YOU WOULD I IT IS A NEW FEATURE IT IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL
NO THE CURVE DOESN'T REALLY
NO THEN IT WILL WON'T UH STAND UP FROM THE TABLE
THEN IT WOULD JUST
YEAH
SO
WE WOULD LOSE THIS ONE
YEAH WE COULD S YEAH A BIT
SIXTEEN POINT THREE
SO WE STILL
COULD COULD WE DO IT ON A REGULAR CHIP ON PRINT OR SOMETHING
NO
MA Y YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT OR UH
WE CHANGED TH
YEAH AND THE SINGLE CURVED TO UNCURVED
NO
YEAH BUT IT'S T
YEAH BUT IT IS UH IT IT IS A NEW FEATURE IT IS SOMETHING SPECIAL
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH THAT'S DIFFICULT
YEAH
UH
WE COULD MAKE IT TITANIUM INSTEAD OF RUBBER
OH
OH CAN I ASK SOMETHING
WHAT IS SPECIAL COLOUR
IS THAT THE WOOD UH WOOD UH THIS WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT ONE TOO
TH THEN WE STILL HAVE TOO MUCH
IF WE USE THE UH
YEAH WE WE SCRAP THAT ONE
SEE A PO THREE
WE NEED POINT THREE
UH IT'S A COLOUR
DON'T MAKE IT WOOD
MAKE IT UH
YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S SPECIAL COLOUR IS IT
A ALL KIND OF COLOURS
IT'S ALSO GREEN OR UH
YEAH BUT IT'S A SPECIAL COLOUR THAN JUST RUBBER COLOUR
YOU HAVE TO ADD SOMETHING TO THE RUBBER TO MAKE IT GREEN
YOU DON'T SAY HERE'S GREEN RUBBER
YEAH YOU CAN YOU SHOULD YOU HAVE TO LOSE
NO IT IS THE SCROLL WHEEL I GUESS
A PUSH YEAH
SWITCH COLOURS
IT WAS SUCH A GREAT IDEA
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
OH
BUT I THINK WHEN YOU USE THE COLOUR THAT'S NOT ORIGINALLY THE RUBBER THEN YOU USE SPECIAL COLOUR 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO ADD IT
YEAH SO YOU ALWAYS LOSE THE SPECIAL COLOUR
YOU CO YOU COULD MAKE IT ALWAYS BLACK LIKE NORMAL REMOTE
OH RIGHT YEAH
YEAH WE SHOULD U YEAH
WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS LIKE FOUR OR FIVE OR SOMETHING
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS
YEAH
OH RIGHT YEAH
IS IT PER REMOTE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AND YOU ONE COLOUR PER REMOTE
SO THEN IT IS ONE
NO
ONE
SO IT WOULD BE CURVED SINGLE CURVE
OR NOT
SO Y YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE A NICE REMOTE
IT'S TOO BAD FOR THE SPEAKER
SHOULD WE CHANGE THAT THA THAT THAT'S A ONE IF NOT OR NOT
COULD YOU COPY IT
AND MAKE IT UH
THE ENTIRE UH
PERHAPS YOU CAN THEN COPY PAGE OR SO

ADD IT COPY PAGE
SELECT ALL
ALRIGHT SOMETHING WENT WRONG

LET'S FORGET
YEAH
OH IGNORE THAT
WELL SO
TOO BAD
YEAH
THE MICROPHONE
YEAH
A AND WE CHANGED SOMETHING I GUESS OR NOT

OH NO
YEAH I TRIED TO COPY THAT ONE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
SO WE COULD FIX IT LIKE THA THAT IT'S LIKE THIS
YOU COULD SELECT IT ALL BUT THEN YOU CAN'T ERASE
ERASE
WHEN YOU SAW TH LI UH EARLIER WHEN WE SELECTED IT W I COULDN'T ERASE ANYTHING
JUST TAP SOMEWHERE

AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR THE FIRST TEN MINUTES BEFORE WE GOT HERE SO I WENT RIGHT
YEAH
JUST LOOKING AT THE SCREEN AND UH
YEAH AN
YEAH THAT WILL BE HANDY
YEAH
YEA UH SO THA ACTUALLY YOU COULD MAKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN BUT NO MIC OR IT COULD MAKE MIC BUT NO L. C. D. SCREEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT
YEAH
UH I DUNNO
THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT
HMM
HEAVIER UM LESS HEAVY LAPTOPS
YEAH
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY UH
YEAH
YEAH EVERYTHING WORKED
YEAH BUT IT'S JUST THE THE OFF HOURS BETWEEN THAT YOU WILL WORK ALONE
THEN IT POPS UP POP UP SCREEN CAME
FIVE MINUTES IN THE MEETING
NO
HUH
YOU DID
WELL
OH RIGHT
WELL
YEAH
CHAMPAGNE
YEAH
DO WE GET ANOTHER EMAIL
I I THINK WE HAVE TO FILL IN A QUESTIONNAIRE AGAIN BUT
WE DO
YEAH
UH TH THAT THAT ONE
YOU CAN JUST YEAH BUT IT'S IT ISN'T A PICTURE OR WELL IS IT
NO ISN'T POSSIBLE
BUT YOU CAN MAKE A SCREEN SHOT I THINK
YEAH
UH OH EXPORT
IMAGES
HOW BIG DO YOU WANT THE IMAGES
YEAH
THIS ONE
THIS ONE
UM
WELL IT ISN'T ON THE DESKTOP
YOU CAN ONLY SAVE IT IN MY DOCUMENTS
OH
OH ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THREE
CAN WE STAY HERE
YEAH
YEAH ALRIGHT
WHY CAN'T WE STAY HERE
YEAH
BEEP
OH
UH WE SHOULD SAVE THAT ONE
YEAH SAVE IN THE FOLDER
SAVE AS PROJECT
OH OKAY
HMM-HMM
AGENDA
OH SORRY
OKAY
GET UP STAND UP
JUST 'KAY
VIEW
JUST EXAMPLE COLOUR SO UH THERE'S ONE OF THE COLOURS WE WOULD LIKE TO UH SEE IN OUR PROTOTYPE
OKAY
YEAH JUST UH JUST AN IDEA ABOUT HOW TO M TH THAT COULD ALSO BE POSSIBLE
UH WELL IT'S AN IDEA IN A SO
DO NOT FORGET IT
TO FUNCTION IT IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO BE SM UH BIG OF COURSE
THE MICROPHONE COULD BE JUST A MINOR UH HOLE UH ON THE LEFT UH BUTTON
OKAY UM
WE ALSO MADE SOME UH IDEAS ABOUT HOW UH THE OPTIONS MENU WOULD WORK
UH USING THE SCROLL BUTTON ON SIDES UH Y UH I UH UM
YEAH YOU PUSH THE SCROLL BUTTON
AND A DROP DOWN MENU OR A PULL OUT MENU COMES OUT AND UH YOU GET UH YOU GET THE OPTIONS UH BECOMING AVAILABLE
FOR EXAMPLE UH T. V. SETTINGS UH REMOTE SETTINGS ET CETERA
SO UH YOU CAN SCROLL DOWN TOO WITH THE SCROLL UH BUTTON UH AS YOU CAN SEE OH IT'S HERE JUST PUSH IT IN
UH THE MENU COMES OUT LIKE THIS AND UH I IT ALL BECOMES VISIBLE
UM
YEAH THAT'S C YEAH
INDEED
OKAY UM IT'S ALSO UH NICE TO SEE THAT UM WE MADE A SMALL UH MENU
UH THE OPTIONS MENU UH BECOMING AVAILABLE WHEN PRESSING THE UH SCROLL UH BUTTON
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE TELETEXT
WHI WHICH IS USED UH WHICH SHOULD STILL BE USED AND WE THINK THAT IT'S UH VERY HANDY TO PUT IT UH NOT UH UNDER THE OPTIONS MENU
BUT IN UH YES
IN AN APART UH
IN A SEPARATE BUTTON YEAH
A SIGN YEAH JUST LIKE OKAY INDEED
OKAY WE CAN UH MODIFY THAT LATER
OKAY
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT NEXT UH
PREVIOUS PAGE YEAH INDEED
OH MY GOD
IT'S QUITE LARGE
OKAY
YOU CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY NOW THAT THE UH TELETEXT AND OPTIONS MENU ISN'T UH TAKING UH MUCH UH UH IT'S TAKING MUCH PART OF THE SCREEN
SO IT'S VERY UH WHEN YOU UH WHEN YOU USE IT DOESN'T UH BECOME IRRITATING TO SEE
'CAUSE IF YOU PUT IT ON THE TOP YOU ALWAYS GET SEE THE THE OPTIONS MENU
'CAUSE PEOPLE REGULARLY UH READ FROM LEFT TOP TO RIGHT DOWN SO
OKAY
HUH
FULL SCREEN
ALRIGHT
HUH
MY NAME MY JOB
SORRY YOU USED THE POWERPOINT
WHAT
BLING
NOW UH THE SINGLE CURVED IDEA WAS UH
YEAH OKAY YOU GE UM
YEAH
THE SIDEWAYS VIEW UH THAT THAT THAT MA
HO NOT THAT PEN
NOT THAT PEN
SUPPOSE SO
AH
OH MY GOD IT WORKS
YEAH THAT'S THE SINGLE CURVE INDEED
YEP
THAT'S NOT VERY I IT'S ALSO UH VERY HANDY IF YOU MAKE A SIDE CURVE WAY TO MAKE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL VERY THIN AT THE BOTTOM UH AT A BOTTOM AT A BOTTOM
UH MAKE IT UH RATHER THICK ON THE TOP BECAUSE UH ON THE TOP IT HAS UH THE SCREEN
WHICH TAKES UH IN SOME UH SPACE AND THE BATTERIES CAN BE LOCATED OVER THERE SO UH
YEAH
NO
YEAH
OKAY INDEED
YEAH
I THINK SO
IT'S PRETTY FANCY
YOU GET TH
YEAH
IT'S TRUE IT'S A ONE
VERY FANCY
IT'S VERY TRUE BECAUSE WE DESIGNED IT TO BE VERY FANCY SO
IT'S VERY FANCY I THINK
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE THIS
NO OKAY SO SO IT'S FANCY
YEAH
AND UH UH THE SCROLL IS RUBBER SO S
ENO ENOUGH TO I THINK
HUH
WITH THE ONES
YEAH
TAKE A HARDER LOOK YEAH SURE
IT'S EASIER THAN THE REGULAR UH REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
YEAH
THEY ARE A LOT EASIER TO FIND THAN UH TH THAN ON THE REGULAR REMOTE CONTROLS WHERE YOU HAVE TO UH FIND OUT WHAT WHICH SIGN OR ICON MEANS ON UH EVERY BUTTON
SO YOU HAVE T YOU HAVE TO USE THE THE THE MANUAL TO UNDERSTAND MOST YEAH
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S A TWO AT LEAST
IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT
A THREE
AND WHY IS THAT
IT SAID BO BOTH THE OPTIONS
YEAH
A TWO A TWO
UH THE NEXT QUESTION THE NEXT QUESTION
OH MY GOD
YEAH I WAS UH YEAH
I THINK IT'S THE MOST USEFUL UH REMOTE CONTROL EVER TO BE MANUFACTURED
YEAH BUT BECAUSE IT HAS THE REGULAR UH CONTROLS LI UH AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE SCREEN NOW AND UH
YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE OTHER OPTIONS UH ALWAYS UH ON YOUR SCREEN
SO IT'S T I THINK IT'S REALLY EASY TO USE
YOU WANT THESE OPTIONS TO
UH SURE
PERHAPS THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST UH
UH BECAUSE A LOT OF
CHANNEL ONE CHANNEL FOUR YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT DOES
BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T UH
UH A TWO
SURE TWO
OH
TWO
GIVE ME MORE
NO
THAT'S DEFINITELY OUR UH
A FALSE YEAH
YEAH INDEED
YEAH IS OPTIONAL
HUH
YEAH
YEAH IT IS IT IS HARDER TO
TO LIKE
GEEZ
WE'RE GETTING PAID
WE'RE GETTING PAID
UH
YEAH IT'S A THREE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE IT UH RATHER FLEXIBLE BUT NOT TOO FLEXIBLE BECAUSE IT HAS A L. C. D. SCREEN
HARD TO LOSE YEAH IT SH AND IT'S EASY TO FIND
ISN'T HARD TO LOSE
ISN'T HARD TO LOSE YEAH
YEAH THIS THIS IS HARD TO LOSE
THIS
TWO YEAH
AND MOST ALL BECAUSE OF THE OPTION TO WHOA
UH
PUT THE COR CURSOR ON THE
CLICK
TRUE
TRUE
UH YEAH
UH
MATERIALS YEAH
UH OKAY
SO MA UH MAKE IT MAKE IT A TWO
A TWO
I THINK IT'S TWO
I THINK IT'S TWO TOO TWO TOO TOO
WELL PERHAPS NOT
WELL N NOT EXACTLY BUT UH UH IF IT HAD SOME GAMES ON IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT IT'S FOR A REMOTE CONTROL I THINK IT I IT WOULD SATISFY THOSE NEEDS
YEAH THE SPEECH POSSIBILITY THE COLOURS
SCROLL OPTIONS YEAH
YEAH
THE EASY VOLUME UP BUTTON
REMOTE YOUNGER PEOPLE USUALLY USE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO PUT ON THE VOLUME
TURN UH TURN UP THE VOLUME
TWO
ONE TWO THREE
RIGHT
UH
OKAY TRUE YEAH
I THINK IT'S EASIER TO USE THAN A REGULAR REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUSH ON THE OPTIONS MENU
YOU GET THE THE THE VARIOUS OPTIONS UH ENTIRELY EXPLAINED
ENTIRELY EXPLAINED
INSTEAD OF UH JUST FINDING OUT WHAT AN ICON MEANS ON A BUTTON
YEAH YOU CAN NAVIGATE
UH
YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED OKAY
LET'S START OVER AGAIN THEN
A TWO
OH YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH
AND THREE
THE AVERAGE
YEAH I THINK SO
SAVE
IT'S A FLY
OH M
YEAH
EXACTLY
YEAH
IT I IT WASN'T TOO MUCH
AS WELL AS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
WHOA
COUNT IT
YOU GOT EXCEL TO COUNT
OH OKAY
WELL I DRA UH DANNY DANNY I'LL DO THAT BECAUSE I DRAW THE UH
NO NO SOLAR CELL NO NO NO NO
NO HAND DYNAMO
HAND
ON ADVANCED CHIP
YEAH YEAH
SINGLE NEE SINGLE CURVED
DOUBLE CURVED WAS UH UH SEE UH JU THREE DIMENSIONAL
BUT IT ISN'T THREE DIMENSIONAL IT ISN'T CURVED IN A L
NO NO NO SINGLE CURVED IS LIKE THIS
UH THAT'S THE ONLY CURVE YOU MADE NOT TH UH CURVED LIKE THAT
THAT'S UH
HUH
YEAH
YEAH WE GOTTA INTEGRATE SCROLL WHEEL AND PUSH BUTTON BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUSH IT AND YOU W IT WON'T JUST PU UH MAKES POSSIBLE TO S
NOT GOING TO WORK
OKAY
OKAY UM
BUT NOW BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
WE DON'T GOT THE BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
DAMN
OKAY
NAH
WE COULD LOSE THE SCROLL WHEEL
YOU COULD MAKE IT JUST A REGULAR SCROLL WHEEL
YEAH
IF YOU CAN'T PUSH IT YOU HAVE TO TAP THE THE OPTIONS WINDOW UH BUTTON HERE AND THEN UH SCROLL DOWN WITH THE D WITH UH WITH UH THE BUTTON
NORMAL SCROLL WHEEL
LOSE
OKAY SO WE DON'T EXACTLY NEED THE SINGLE WE DON'T NEED A CURVE
'S POSSIBLE TO LOSE CURVE
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S MEANT WITH SCR UH WITH S CURVE
THE CURVE IS UH IN A DIMENSION
IF YOU MAKE IT A FLAT ONE S N IT'S NO CURVE YOU GOT NO CURVES
YEAH OKAY
NO TWO
OH OKAY INDEED
IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE
NO
THE SAMPLE SPEAKER IS TWO D WAIT F S FOUR POINTS
YEAH UH BECAU UH WHEN YOU LOSE THE
YEAH
NO THAT'S NO
MAKE IT W UH WHEN YOU MADE IT UH UH UH A REMOTE CONTROL OF WOOD
YOU DON'T MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL OF AH
IT ISN'T
WHAT
TO KNOCK THE SAMPLE SPEAKER YEAH
AND SAMPLE SENSOR
BUT M YEAH COURSE BUT WHAT WE'LL HAVE
LET'S MAKE IT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN
A COLOUR
YEAH SPECIAL COLOURS FRUITY COLOURS
YEAH
YEAH
THEY DON'T SELL GREEN RUBBER PLANTS
ALRIGHT
NO NO NO
IF WE LOSE THE SCROLL WHEEL AND MAKE IT TOTALLY UH DEPENDING UH DEPENDENT ON UH THE TOUCH SCREEN
THEN IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE
AND THEN YOU CAN AND THEN YOU CAN ADD TO THE COLOURS
SPECIAL C OKAY IF YOU LOSE UH IF YOU LOSE THE
YOU LOSE THIS ONE YOU GOT ELEVEN POINT FIVE AND YOU MAKE I AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE UH THE SPEC SINGLE CURVE FOR EXAMPLE
HOW D UH UH HOW MANY COLOURS
SPECIAL COLOURS ALL THE COLOURS YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE P
YEAH BUT UH WHEN YOU USE MORE THAN ONE COLOUR IT'S A SPECIAL COLOUR
I SUPPOSE
YEAH
NEE WE WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE ANO ANOTHER COLOUR
YEAH INDEED YEAH
YOU DON'T NEED FOUR OF THOSE UH FOUR OF THOSE SPECIAL COLOURS IN ONE IN ONE REMOTE
HMM
YEAH SINGLE CURVE
UH
HUH
OKAY
UNDO UNDO
UNDO
SO 'KAY
TWENTY MINUTES
OKAY SO YOU HAD THIS LIST AT START
ALRIGHT
WHEN DID YOU RECEIVE THIS LIST
AH OKAY
AH OKAY
I SUPPOSE THIS IS A
OKAY SO WE LOSE THE SCROLL WHEEL THE S
AND THE MICROPHONE
OKAY
STRANGE
YOU CAN ONLY RE ERASE
OH
UH NO
BLING
AH
JUST UP SOMEWHERE B UH BESIDES IT RIGHT
UH WE ALREADY TRY
ALL I NEED IS NO MIC
BON CHANCE
NO ADD
YEAH
S DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LINES AND TEXT AND THE PEN
HUH LOOKS FUCKING BORING NOW
DEADLINES WERE SOMETIMES VERY SHORT
BUT AND STRESSFUL
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT BUT WHY NOT WORK HERE TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE
WHY SHOULD WE BE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER IN THOSE DIFFERENCE UH DIFFERENT ROOMS
YEAH
HUH OH RIGHT
BUT THE TECHNOLOGY WAS UH FANTASTIC
WORK NOW
PERHAPS IT IS E
YEAH PERHAPS IT IS EASIER TO GET ONE OF THOSE UH DIG DIGITAL PENS OR SO AND TO UH AND LAY IT NEXT TO THAT KEYBOARD OVER THERE
SO YOU CAN DRAW UH SEE IT OVER TH ON THE SCREEN
YEAH
IT'S USEFUL BUT NOT M
BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT THIS PEN ON THE SCREEN UH UH FOR EXAM AND LINE IS D BEING DRAWN AT AT TWO OR THREE CENTIMETRES UH BELOW
ALRIGHT
THE PROJECT UH BECAUSE OF THE DEADLINES YOU DIDN'T HAD THE TIME TO UH HAVE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO UH TO MAKE A VERY UH
QUALITATI QUALITATIVE UH PRESENTATION
SO YOU USED UH THIS
UH THE DIFFERENT POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS UH IN WHICH YOU PUT YOUR UH MATERIAL IN THE
OH
WASN'T ME
BUT I DIDN'T I UH
I USED IT TOO BUT OH WELL
YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE IT SHOU
TO MAKE SOME DESIGNS IT IS VERY EASY
YEAH
BUT TO WRITE IT TH YEAH
YEAH IT'S TOO BIG IT'S TOO FAT
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO TOO TOO TOO
YEAH OR THE ROOM FOR IT WAS THE IDEA TO BE CREATIVE SO
YOU GOT SOME STANDARD IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD AND THIS WHAT CAME OUT
YEAH
THE INFORMATION UH WAS SOMETIMES UH A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE OR
YEAH
WAS SEARCHING AND SEARCHING
NO W I DIDN'T KNOW
MAKE A R YEAH
YEAH
NO STEPPING ON THE TABLE AND THEN LOOKING AT THE INTERNET PAGE
NO
YEAH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COSTS
FIRST OF ALL I DIDN'T THINK UH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN UH FIRST POINT BUT UH IT WAS POSSIBLE UH UH YEAH
YEAH
UH
FASTER LAPTOP
UH
THEY WERE THEY WERE JUST FINE
UH
RIGHT
YEAH
MM
YEAH SURE
OH THANK YOU
BLING
YOU'RE FIRED
MM
YOU CANNOT YOU CAN SAVE IT
YOU S UH FILE SAVE AS THE J. PEG J. PEG

YEAH
IF IT BROWSE
DESKTOP
MM
I DO NOT KNOW
OH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
OH
OH
THAT'S NEW ONE
YEP
YEP
BIG MICROPHONE
OH OKAY
THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE NOT THE SIZE
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY
OF COURSE
MM
MM TH YEAH
SMALL
SHIT
'KAY
EVALUATION
'KAY MY TASK WAS THIS TIME TO PUT UP A QUESTIONNAIRE
BY WHICH WE CAN EVALUATE THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL BY THE QUESTIONS WE REQUIREMENTS FROM THE OF THE USERS
MY NAME MY JOB OKAY
THE METHODS
QUESTIONNAIRE WITH SEVEN POINT SCALE FROM ONE TO SEVEN FROM TRUE TO FALSE
LIKE QUESTION IS REMOTE BIG ENOUGH WE CAN SAY IT'S TRUE OR IT'S FALSE BY STEPS
ONE MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE SEVEN MEANS TRUE
THE THREE IMPORTANT THINGS OF REFA ARE UH FROM TH OF THIS YEAR IS ARE IS THE REMOTE CONTROL FANCY ENOUGH
IS IT IN INNOVATIVE ENOUGH AND IS IT EASY ENOUGH TO USE
AND THEN EVALUATION ITSELF
UH
SO
OKAY
FIRST QUESTION
IS THE DESIGN FANCY ENOUGH
PROJECT MANAGER WHAT DO YOU THINK
BUT DOES IT
YEAH
THINK
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN
ISN'T GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT HEAVY AT THE TOP
WITH TWO BATTERIES THE WHOLE PRINT PLATE AND T AND TOP AND IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT QUITE A LOT I THINK
YEAH
YEAH WE HAVE TO RATE
IS IT FANCY ENOUGH
TRUE IS ONE FALSE IS SEVEN
SO FANCY ENOUGH MEANS DOES IT COMES TO THE YOUNGER PEOPLE AND THE ELDER PEOPLE
I THINK
YEAH I HAVE TO AGREE ALL THE COLOUR COLOURS DON DON DOESN'T MATTER THAT M THAT MUCH NOW IT'S ONLY DESIGN
AND THE DESIGN
SO
A TWO
YEAH I N USED I WOULDN I SHOULD USE THAT ONE BUT IT DOESN'T
OKAY NO IT'S TWO
TRUE IS A ONE
VERY TRUE IS IT VERY TRUE OR ISN'T THAT TRUE
YEAH I THINK TWO
THAT'S FANCY ENOUGH
THEN
OKAY
LET'S GIVE IT A TWO
IS IT INNOVATIVE
ENOUGH
WE HAVE FOR THE SEARCH FUNCTION
THE SCROLLER A BIT I THINK IT'S IT'S A ONE YEAH
TRUE
ALSO HUH UH-HUH THE BUTTONS ARE THEY EASY TO FIND
THAT WAS A BIG REQUIREMENT OF THE OLD PEOPLE
ARE ALL THE BUTTONS EASY TO FIND
NOT ONLY THIS BUTTONS ALL THE BUTTONS
I THINK TH IT'S
EASY T
YEAH I THINK THIS IS EASY NOW
I THINK TH I THINK THE OPTIONS BUTTONS ARE NOT THE THE EASIEST WAY TO TO
TO HANDLE
TRUE
I WOULD RATE IT A
YEAH OKAY THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
BUT THAT'S THAT'S VANTAGE OF L. C. D. SCREEN YOU CAN HAVE TEXT
YEAH
I THINK IT'S A THREE
I PERSONALLY THINK BECAUSE I D I DON'T THINK I MAYBE IT'S EASY TO USE IT HAS TO BE EASY TO FIND RIGHT AWAY
I I THINK IF YOU HAVE THE BUTTON AT THE RIGHT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND THE OPTION BUTTON THAT EASY
YOU CAN TOUCH IT
YEAH OKAY BUT YOU HAVE Y THEN YOU HAVE HERE S WRITTEN OPTION ON HERE THE TELETEXT BUTTON RIGHT
OKAY THEN OKAY GOOD
THEN I THINK ALSO TWO YEAH
YEP
IT'S EASY TO USE AS WELL FOR YOUNGER AS ELDERL ELDERLY PEOPLE
YOUNG MEANS SIXTEEN TO FORTY YEARS
AND ELDERLY FROM FORTY EIGHT TO THEIR DEATH
ALSO IF YOU'RE SIXTY YEARS OLD
ALSO
YEAH AS WELL AS YOUR IF YOU'RE FIF SIXTY YEARS OLD YOU'RE HOLDING ONE OF THOSE THINGS IN YOUR HAND
NO BUT WE'RE GOING TO TH MAKE THIS F FOR A ALL KIND OF PEOPLE SO IT IT IT HAS TO BE
IF YOU READ THE MANUAL ALWAYS
SO
ALSO TWO
NOT A SEVEN FOR THIS
I WOULD ALSO SAY THREE
REMOTES OVERWHELMED WITH BUTTONS
NO THAT THAT'S THAT'S YEAH
THA THAT'S A ONE I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY A ONE
NO
OH YEAH
YEAH I THINK ISN'T THIS HAS TO BE SOMETHING LIKE ISN'T OVERWHELMED
TRUE
REMOTE CONTROL HAS UH COLOURS THAT DIFFERENT THAT MEET DIFFERENT TARGET GROUPS
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
ALSO WITH RUBBER
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
THAT'S A ONE
OKAY
UH I HAVE
THE MATERIAL USED IS SPONGY THAT THAT'S UH THAT'S A ONE THAT'S M RUBBER
YEAH I TH THINK IT'S NOT THE MOST SPONGY THING
YEAH
REMOTE CONTROL IS HARD TO LOSE
Y YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T LOSE IT IF YOU'RE SIXTY YEARS OLD
IF FIRST TIME SEE THE THING YOU DIDN DIDN'T ADJUST UH SET THE MICROPHONE AND THEN YOU LOSE IT THEN YOU HAVE LOST IT
IT ISN'T HARD NO
I THINK I THINK THIS IS A TWO PERSONALLY
NO
ISN'T HARD TO LOSE
YEAH
YOU CAN'T LOSE IT
OR IF YOU'RE YOU'RE SIXTY YEARS OLD YOUR DEMANDS
I THINK YEAH I THINK ALSO
HUH
YEAH
OH OKAY
NO
OKAY OKAY OKAY
REMOTE CONTROL MAINLY BE SOLD TO YOUNGER PEOPLE
YEAH
TRUE
VERY TRUE
NO I DON'T THINK VERY TRUE BECAUSE THE COLOURS
WE HAVE THE COLOURS
UM WE HAVE THE BUTTONS IS AREN'T THAT THAT MUCH
NAH THE MATERIAL ISN'T THAT
SO I DON I THINK I THINK IT'S A THREE
YEAH BUT I UH
OKAY OKAY
I THINK BECAUSE YEAH
IN THE FEATURES
BECAUSE YOUNGER PEOPLES ARE CR CRITICAL AND THEY WANTED A LOT OF FEATURES ON THIS THING
L. C. D. SCREEN AND SCROLL
I I THINK THEY'LL BE QUITE MET WITH THEIR EXPECTATIONS
NO
IT'S THREE FEATURES BASICALLY THE L. C. D. TOUCH SCREEN IS FEATURE
THE MICROPHONE IS A FEATURE
YEAH OKAY
I THINK YEAH AND THEN YOU HAVE THE AUDIO SETTINGS CHANNEL SETTING VIDEO SETTINGS
YEAH YEAH
SO I'VE CHOS I SHOU I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S A ONE
PERSONALLY YEAH
I THINK ONCE YOU'VE 'CAUSE YOU HAVE THE CHANNEL FEATURES B UH YOU HAVE THE UH SCREEN FEATURES AUDIO FEATURES
THE YOU HAVE ALL BUTTONS ON IT WHICH YOU'D LIKE MICROPHONE EXTRA L. C. D. SCREEN EXTRA SCROLL
THING EXTRA
MAKE IT MAKE IT A TWO
OR MAKE IT UH A FUCKING TWO
YOU CAN SEE THE REMOTE CONTROL IS R. AND R.
HAS OH YEAH DO DID HAVE NAH Y YOU HAVE THE BLACK ONE
AND WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE ALSO A YELLOW ONE
MAYBE TWO
X. MARKS SPOT
AND THE MENU IS AVAIL THAT IS AVAILABLE IS EASY TO USE
YEAH THA THAT'S SO TRUE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH UH
I THINK THAT WOU THAT WOULD BE QUITE HARD TO LEARN TO USE IT
NO I'M NOT NOT CONVINC
LET'S GO TH FOR I THINK IT WOULD BE A T YEAH TWO
NOW LOWER
SO OKAY WE HAVE ONE THREE A ONE THAT THAT HAVE TO GOT UP
TWO TWO TWO TWO TWO
SO TWO YEAH
THE AVERAGE IS A TWO
THAT IS QUITE GOOD
IN MY OPINION
THAT
OOH
OOH
TOP
OKAY
YES
NO IT'S TWO
THE AVERAGE IS TWO
YEAH I UH UH I UH SAVED IT
F FIFTY FIVE EUROS
NO
YEAH MM YEAH MAYBE
THE MICROPHONE
YEAH
MAYBE YOU'RE GOING SCRAP SCRAP IT
NO PROB
AH
COUNT IT
LI LIKE WRITE IT BE
AH OKAY COOL
HUH
YEAH
OH YEA YEAH YOU DESIGN IT
UM
YEAH
SOLAR CELL
NO IT TOOK A BATTERY
YEAH
WE HAVE
NO WE HAVE SAMPLE SPEAKER
BUT B AL BUT WE ALSO HAVE SAMPLE SPEAKER DO
OH WE ALREADY ON NINE
WE HAVE DOUBLE CURVED
SINGLE
THIS ONE IS
THIS ONE IS CURVED LIKE THIS RIGHT
IT'S CURVED LIKE THIS
YEAH BU WHAT
OH BUT WE HAVE CURVES LIKE IT AND IT
THERE ARE TWO CURVES RIGHT
OH OKAY I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND
RUBBER
PUSH BUTTON
NO WE DON'T HAVE PUSH BUTTON
L. C. D. DISPLAY
EIGHTEEN AND A HALF DAMN
WE HAVE TO LOWER IT WITH SIX POINTS
TWELVE AND HALF
WE COULD USE
I THINK WE SHOULD SCRAP THE SAMPLE SPEAKER
IT'S FOUR PRI IT FOUR UNITS
BUT W D WHA
CURVED THEN IT WILL BE SQUARE
WAS THAT DOES THAT MEAN TO IT SINGLE CURVE
OKAY
YEAH BUT THA THAT THAT ONLY IS ONE
NO ONE
SO WE DON'T YEAH WE ALSO HAVE TO
NO OTHERWISE WE DON'T HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN
SINGLE CURVED
FLAT
YEAH SO THAT DOES DOESN'T DOESN'T THAT MU I THINK
SCRAP SAMPLE SPEAKER
THAT THAT'S UH
YES FOUR POINTS
YEAH BUT WHAT WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE UH DO YOU WANT TO SCRAP
F YOU HAVE TO WE HAVE TO SCRAP FOUR POINTS
MA MAKE IT WITH WOOD INSTEAD OF RUBBER
YEAH IT IT I YEAH IT ALSO UH IT ALSO TAKES ONE POINT LESS
YEAH
I THINK IT IS
YEAH
YEAH
SAMPLE SPEAKER
YEAH OKAY THREE
POINT THREE
HUH
POINT TWELVE
THAT'S A SCROLL WHEEL
YEAH BUT A WOOD WE CAN MAKE IT BROWN DARK BROWN NOT WOOD
IS IT ALSO NO THAT THAT'S JUST NORMAL COLOUR FRUIT COLOURS
NORMAL COLOURS YELLOW
YEAH BUT THEN I D I DON'T THINK WE CAN EVER MAKE TO A TWELVE AND HALF
BUT THEN WE HAVE TO SCRAP L. C. D. DISPLAY WE HAVE TO SCRAP UH
S ADVANCED CHIP
NO THEN WE HAVE TO SCRAP EVERYTHING WE GOT BECAUSE HOW MANY COLOURS WE GONNA MAKE
FIVE
THEN WE HAVE TWO
S TOUCH
THEN WE CAN MAKE ADD TWO COLOURS ON IT
YEAH TWO COLOURS IT
THEY CAN ADD TWO COLOURS
BUT THE COLOURS

I THEN I THINK I P I DON I DON'T THINK THEY ME MEAN THEY'RE SPECIAL
YEAH OKAY OKAY TRUE
TRUE TRUE
WE HAVE TWO POINTS SPARE
NEE ONE POINT
MM YEP
Y YEA THE SCROLL WHEEL IS DROPPED
YEP
TAP
IT SHOULD'VE WORK
YEP
JUST TAP SOMEWHERE
NO
EVALUATION DROPS
AND ERASE THE MIC
LOOKS LIKE A IPOD
OH
ALL I NEED IS MIC
STATION PAGE
I THINK WE IT SHOULD BE B IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE WORKED A LITTLE BIT TOGETHER
NOW WE WORKED THROUGH EACH OTHER SOMETHING HE SAID YEAH AND YOU HAD INFORMATION I ALSO HAD
SO SOME SOME THINGS I HAD IN MY PRESENTATION THEY ALREADY TOLD SO
SO YEAH THAT I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO WORK AT FOR SUCH PROJECT
YEAH NO OR MAYBE SESSION OF FIVE MINUTES TOGETHER OR SOMETHING AND THEN WORK SEPARATE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH M YEAH LIKE SHE TOLD
THEN YOU CAN WORK TOGETHER TOO BY MAIL OR BY I DUNNO CHAT SOMETHING BUT NOW WE'RE COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE BEST WAY BUT
YEAH THE TECHNOLOGY'S OKAY
YEAH OKAY BUT I DON I DO I THINK BECAU THAT'S BECAUSE
YEAH
YEAH LIKE THE F LIKE A PLOTTERS OR SOMETHING YEAH
YEP YEP YEP YEP YEP
YEAH IT IS USEFUL BUT
NO
YEP
I DIDN'T USE IT AT ALL
I DIDN'T USE
NO YEAH
IT IS IT IS YEAH IT IS EASY FOR TO DESIGN SOMETHING AND THEN LOAD IT IN YOUR COMPUTER
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S B BI LITTLE BIT TOO BIG TO WRITE
YEAH
FAT DOCUMENT THOSE
TEAM WORK WAS OKAY
ONLY THING THAT WE WORKED THROUGH PAST EACH OTHER
WITH SOME THINGS THAT WAS ONLY PROBLEM BUT
YEAH YEAH YEAH BUT FURTHERMORE BETTER
THAT'S YEAH NO PROB
AH

NO I I NEVER GOT THAT
I ALWAYS
N YEAH
SO DOES THIS I THINK LIK OH AND INFORMATION WAS A BIT LOW I THINK
SOMETIMES IN IN IN IN THE BEGINNING I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT TO DO
YEAH LIKE I WITH WITH THE REMOTE AND I NEVER NEW WE HAVE T WE HAD TO UH YEAH MADE A MADE A REC A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH SO
SO YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
FASTER
YEAH
YEAH IT ONLY COSTS FOUR UNITS
UH YEAH
UM
YEAH
NOTHING
I THINK WE GOT IT ALREADY
YEAH
AND FURTHERMORE THE THE THE NETWORK WAS OKAY

OKAY LET'S GET STARTED
UH I SORT OF PREPARED THIS
UH OPENING ACQUAINTANCE TOOL TRAINING UH HOW TO USE THE THINGS HERE
UH PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND YEAH THEN THE REST OF THE MEETING
UM WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DEVELOP A NEW REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S BOTH ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
SO HOPE YOU HAVE GOOD IDEAS
I DON'T
UM WE'RE WORK WE'RE WORKING UH FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
UH FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THEN WE DO SOME IN INDIVIDUAL WORK THEN WE HAVE A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS ETCETERA ETCETERA
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE SHOULD HAVE A PROTOTYPE DRAWN UP
UH WE HAVE AVAILABLE THE SMART BOARD AND THE WHITEBOARD
UM
UH WE SHOULD TAKE SOME PRACTICE
I HAVE SOME INSTRUCTIONS NOW TO DO THAT
UH WELL YOU KNOW HOW TO THE DOCUMENTS WORK
SO
UH THIS FOR TOOLBAR
YOU SEE IT NEXT
UM
WE HAVE A PEN
AND WE CAN USE THIS PEN TO PERFORM
YES
SO
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK
YES
OKAY SO YOU CAN
DRAW
OKAY AND IN THE FORMAT MENU YOU CAN SELECT COLOUR AND LINE WIDTH ETCETERA ETCETERA
OKAY
UH
OKAY
EACH OF YOU CAN UH TAKE SOME PRACTICE AND YOU SHOULD DRAW AN ANIMAL
UH YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN
UH WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS AND WITH DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS
AND YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU DRAW THAT PARTICULAR ANIMAL
SO JULIAN
UH WITH THE FORMAT MENU
AND USE DIFFERENT COLOURS ETCETERA
AND WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
OH YEAH
OH YEAH FOUR LEGS
UH-HUH
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN PRESS THE NEXT BUTTON WHICH IS UH YEAH
I'LL SHOW YOU
YEAH
IN FILE MENU

OKAY UM WE HAVE A FINANCIAL ASPECT TO THIS PROJECT
UM WE CAN SELL THEM AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
UH
THE AIM IS TO REACH UH UH TO SELL AS MUCH AS FIFTY MILLION EUROS
UH THAT'S QUITE A BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY
AND THE PRODUCTION COST SHOULD BE THE HALF OF THE SELLING PRICE
OKAY NOW IT'S TIME FOR SOME DISCUSSION
UH
YEAH
WE SHOULD GET STARTED
UH I'M TAKING NOTES
UM
WE EACH HAVE A SPECIFIC TASK AS I SAW IN MY MAIL
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU RECEIVED THE SAME MAIL
YEAH
OKAY SO THE UM UH THIS INDUSTRATI INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD PRODUCE A WORKING DESIGN
AM I CORRECT
OKAY
UH THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER SHOULD SPECIFY THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
RIGHT
YEAH
AND THE MARKETING UH EXPERT SHOULD COME UP WITH USER REQUIREMENTS
UH DID ANY OF YOU ALREADY DO SOME WORK ON THIS PART OR
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT THE PRODUCT UH SO FAR
MM-HMM

MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEP

WELL I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO ADD AT THE MOMENT
UM
I THINK THE BEST IS TO GO TO WORK
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
I THINK
WE CAN GO AHEAD WITH WHAT WE HAVE
I WILL SUMMARISE THE THINGS WE DISCUSSED AND PUT IT IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
UH THE USE OF THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER CAN WORK ON THE WORKING DESIGN ETCETERA ETCETERA
AND IT SEEMS YOU GET MORE INFORMATION BY EMAIL
SO THAT WAS IT FOR ME
UH
YEAH IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
YEAH
I'M WRITING VERY FAST
HOPE IT'S READABLE
OKAY UM ANYTHING MORE YOU WANT TO ADD TO THE DISCUSSION
YEAH
BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE A
YEAH
Y YOU DO SOME INDIVIDUAL WORK WE HAVE MEETING INDIVIDUAL WORK MEETING
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE A FINAL MEETING
AND THEN I HAVE TO PREPARE UH I HAVE TO DEFEND OUR DESIGN SO MAKE IT GOOD
I DEPEND ON YOU
YEAH
IF YOU CAN MIX IT IT'S OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT IS THE USER
REQUIREMENTS PART
AS TO WHAT THEY WANT
UH DO THEY WANT ALL THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THAT SMALL
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH I UNDERSTAND
YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD A FEW
YEAH
HMM THE C. D. PLAYER
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
YOU NEED ADDITIONAL YEAH
YEAH
UH
YEAH
YEAH
WE COULD JUST START WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT'S ONLY FOR T. V. AND VIDEO
AND UM RESERVE THE POSSIBILITY TO ADD OTHER FEATURES
SO WE HAVE A BASIC STARTING POINT AND YOU CAN ALWAYS EXTEND THAT SO MAKE SURE IT'S EXTENDIBLE
YEAH
TH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FUNCTIONS POSSIBLE SO IT'S EASIER TO GET TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS ETCETERA
YEAH
OKAY AND UH I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN UH WHEN THE COMPUTER TELLS US TO
YEAH YOU'RE DI DISMISSED
NOT YET
OKAY
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT TO DO

THAT ARE THE THE BASIC OPTIONS FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
YEP
I GOT SOME UH REQUIREMENTS IT HAS UH IT HAS TO BE USER FRIENDLY
UH REALLY EASY TO USE BUTTONS NOT NOT UH VERY SMALL BUTTONS BUT NOT THE THE ALSO THE BIG BIG BUTTONS BUT JUST NORMAL BUTTONS
IT HAS TO BE A SMALL UNIT
IT HAS TO BE UH YEAH YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU UH EVERYWHERE IN IN YOUR HOUSE
SO IT HAS N HAS NOT TO BE L YEAH GIGANTIC UH MACHINE
UH AND A AND A GOOD UH ZAPPING RANGE
UH THE DISTANCE UH FROM YOUR TELEVISION TO YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO BE UH YEAH UM YEAH QUITE A BIG DISTANCE
IT HAS TO BE CAPABLE FOR ZAPPING UH
YEAH
OKAY
ARE YOU GOING TO PUT THE THE NOTES ON THE
OKAY
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
DO WE ONLY HAVE TO TO DO UH PHASE ONE THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH
AFTER THAT WE ARE GOING TO THE CONCEPTUAL UH
OKAY
I WOULD FIRST M
YEAH
I I THINK WE HAVE FIRST TO START WITH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS AND WE CAN UH EXPAND THEM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH IT IT HAS YEAH IT HAS TO BE USER FRIENDLY
SO IT'S HASN'T IT'S YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
CAN WE LEAVE NOW OR
MM
OKAY
GOOD LUCK

I'M AFRAID I'M A BIT SLOW FOR THIS STUFF UH
I'M AFRAID I'M A BIT TOO SLOW
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH PREPARATION YOU GUYS DID BUT NOT A LOT
MM-HMM
NOT YET
OPERATIONS
DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS HOW DO YOU DO THAT
OH OKAY
ARE YOU SERIOUS
I IN THE FILE OPTION MENU
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE TO DRAW ANYWAY
'CAUSE I CAN TAKE FOREVER ON THIS
IS THIS PART OF OUR A ACQUAI OR INTRODUCTION TO EACH OTHER
ALRIGHT
UH
YOUR LINE BROKE
I'M GUESSING A TURTLE
NO
I'M KIDDING
BECAUSE OF ITS SHELL
DUDE YOU'RE A GOOD DRAWER
DO YOU HAVE A TURTLE PET
UH OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
STUMPY STUFF
THEY KIND OF L LOOK LIKE MOLE LEGS
WITH SHARP NAILS ON
A LITTLE TAIL MAYBE
UH NO
THE LITTLE HOLES MAYBE
AND WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THIS ANIMAL
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
COLOURS WERE UNDER FORMAT RIGHT
LET'S SEE
HOW AM I GONNA DO THIS
UM
MM UH
NOT QUITE ACTUALLY
NO
AYE
IT'S A CAT
NOT QUITE YET THROUGH
UH YEAH I DUNNO
THEY'RE MY FAVOURITE PETS
UH I HAVE COLOUR ALREADY
YEAH I'M NOT SO GOOD AT DRAWING WITH THIS KIND OF ST OH SHIT

IT'S A CAT
IT'S MY FAVOURITE UH PET ANIMAL 'CAUSE THEY'RE CUTE THEY'RE INDEPENDENT AND CUDDLY I DUNNO
THAT'S IT
OR DO I NEED TO USE MORE COLOURS AND
ALRIGHT
YEAH
SO WE HAVE TO S
YEAH
MM-HMM
I GUESS SO
YEAH
TRUE
WELL I STARTED MAKING AN OVERVIEW FOR MYSELF UM WHAT I HAD TO DO
'CAUSE WE HAVE THREE DESIGN STEPS AND IN EVERY STEP I HAVE A S SPECIFIC TASK TO PERFORM OR WHATEVER
SO I HAD TO UH I DUNNO MAKE AN OVERVIEW FOR MYSELF ABOUT WHAT I HAVE TO DO
AND KIND OF LET IT WORK IN TO GET IDEAS ABOUT
WELL HOW I HAVE TO FILL IT
WELL I STARTED I STARTED WITH THE FIRST PHASE I THINK WAS THE FUNCTIONAL
AND UH LET'S SEE I HAD TO FOCUS ON THE WORKING DESIGN WHICH YOU SAID
HOW DOES THE APPARATUS WORK
AND WELL I BASICALLY HAD TWO POINTS
UH ACCORDING TO THE COFFEE UH MACHINE EXAMPLE I HAVE BATTERIES TO SUPPLY ENERGY
AND WE YE USE BUTTON PRESSES TO ACTIVATE OR DEACTIVATE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ON THE T. V.
AND THAT'S BASICALLY ALL I HAVE SO FAR
ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I KEPT IT GLOBAL 'CAUSE THAT IT ACTIVATES OR DEACTIVATES SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS 'CAUSE I WASN'T THINKING YET ABOUT THAT
I MEAN YOU WANNA CH CH FLIP THE CHANNEL BUT YOU MIGHT WANNA USE TELETEXT ALSO
I DUNNO WHAT THE WORD IS IN ENGLISH
UH
YEAH
OBVIOUSLY
WHOA
IS THAT YOU OR ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
WELL NO I'M JUST A BIT WONDERING WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THE NEXT UH
SESSION
YEAH OKAY
WE'LL DO OUR BEST
I AM GONNA WORK ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN ALREADY 'CAUSE YEAH IT'S FAIRLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF COMPONENTS WE WANT TO PUT IN
DO WE I MEAN IS IT GONNA BE A MULTIMEDIA CONTROL CENTRE
DO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THE VIDEO RECORDER WITH IT
YEAH
TRUE
BUT BUT WE NEED GOOD COMMUNICATION ABOUT THIS STUFF 'CAUSE I HAVE TO F PUT THE COMPONENTS INTO THE DESIGN
SO IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT COMPONENTS TO PUT IN IT'S KIND OF HARD
YEAH SO
OKAY
YEAH I I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT YOU'LL NE NEED SEVERAL OTHER BUTTONS FOR A VIDEO PLAYER
YOU NEED A PLAY AND A FORW FAST FORWARD AND A STOP FUNCTION
AND YOU YOU DON'T NEED THAT FOR A T. V.
AND AND FOR A T UH TELETEXT YOU NEED ADDITIONAL BUTTONS AS WELL SO I KIND OF NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE UH NEED
WHATEVER I'LL JUST PUT MY IDEAS IN UH
IN HERE AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS IT WITH THE NEXT UH
MEETING
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
YEAH
I UNDERSTAND
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH
THANKS
ALRIGHT
SEE YOU LATER
WHAT THE
WE'RE THE FIRST
MARKETING EXPERT YES

MY SCREEN IS GONE
OH
YEAH
YEAH
VERY NICE
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
DRAW
ALRIGHT
'KAY
DON'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH SPACE
SHOULD IT BE ONE
GIRAFFE'S YELLOW
CAN YOU USE ONE BLANK SHEET PER DRAWING
OR SO Y YOU MUST SAVE IT AT THE END AND THEN
OKAY THEN M MAKE A NEW ONE
IT'S MORE LIKE A DINOSAUR
UH
SOME LEAF TO EAT
YEAH
THANKS
YEAH
UH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
IT'S NOT THAT FAST
YEAH
I SEE
IT MISSES THE SPOT
I SAY GOOD GUESS
UH
BECAUSE IT'S SLOW
YEAH I WAS A BIT SLOW TOO
SO
UH SOME OTHER LINE UH WIDTH UH
NO
I DUNNO
DOES IT HAVE LEGS
YEAH
IT'S MORE LIKE A TANK
YEAH THAT'S FINS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE
SOME SPOTS
AH SOME EYE
YEAH THAT'S A FR FRIENDLY TURTLE I GUESS
YEAH WELL I THINK IT'S UH FAIR ENOUGH
RIGHT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POSITION IS
DOES IT HAVE EARS
NO
OH OKAY
CAN YOU ERASE EARS OR YEAH
ALRIGHT
ERASER
SO
I DUNNO
I IT JUST CAME INTO MY MIND
SO THERE'S NO PARTICULAR REASON I PEN
YEAH
WELL I'M GUESS I'M DONE
THAT'S MY TURTLE
HOW TO SELECT THE NEXT OR HERE
YEAH
HERE YOU GO
A FOX YEAH
FIREFOX
A CAT WHO HAD AN ACCIDENT OR
YEAH
OKAY
GREAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO THAT'S VERY COMMON
YEAH
YEAH
UH WELL FROM A MARKETING UH PERSPECTIVE UM WELL THE FUNCTION DES DESIGN PHASE UH CONSISTS OUT OF THE USER REQUIREMENTS
UM WHAT NEEDS AND DESIRES ARE TO BE FULFILLED
SO THERE ARE A FEW MEANS TO REACH THAT UM BY BY DOING RESEARCH UH TO SEE WHAT EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE THERE OUT IN THE MARKET
I MEAN WHAT FUNCTIONS DO THEY HAVE
UM ESPECIALLY WHAT ARE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS
ARE THERE ANY NEW FUNCTIONS UH WHICH CAN BE ADDED TO OUR PRODUCT
UM THEREFORE WE HAVE TO TO DO SOME INTERNET SEARCH
FOR EXAMPLE FOR UM WELL WHAT KIND OF APPLICATIONS DO CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS SUPPORT AND WHAT ARE F FEATUR FEATURES OF UH CURRENT AND FUTURE TELEVISIONS
SO WE CAN SEE UH WHAT NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED
UM AND WE CAN INTERVIEW CURRENT USERS AND FUTURE USERS
WHAT W WHAT WOULD THEY LIKE TO SEE UH ON A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UM ESPECIALLY FOR FUTURE USERS UH I'M THINKING OF EARLY ADOPTERS BECAUSE THEY THEY USE NEW TECHNOLOGY FIRST
AND THEY PLAY WITH A LOT OF TOOLS AND STUFF SO MAYBE THEY HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS TO UH TO ADD
I THINK I CAN GET THAT INFORMATION YEAH
SO YEAH
NO N NOT SPECIFICALLY
MORE TO HOW TO GET THEM AND
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM OR SOMETHING
YEAH
ANY MORE POINTS TO DISCUSS
ALRIGHT
'KAY
THANKS
YEAH
THE PRO OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
UH
I GUESS SO
YEAH
WE'RE JUST WORKING THE THREE PHASES
OKAY
BETTER MAKE IT
YEAH
THAT IS MY QUESTION ALSO BECAUSE LIKE NEW NEW FUNCTIONS
REQUIREMENTS
YEAH
YEAH
UNIT
YEAH
YEAH WELL I I WAS
YEAH WELL LIKE L LI LIKE SOME LIKE SOME SOME REMOTES WHO ARE OUT THERE
WHICH I KNOW THERE'S ONE BUTTON WHICH IS VERY EASY TO SWITCH BETWEEN DEVICES
SO YOU CAN SWITCH TO YOUR VIDEO AND THEN THE SAME BUTTONS CONTROL YOUR VIDEO
AND ANOTHER FUNCTION I'LL THINK OF SWITCH TO YOUR MEDIA CENTRE BECAUSE THAT'S GETTING VERY POPULAR
AND THEN USE YOUR WINDOWS MEDIA CENTRE UNDER YOUR T. V. WITH THE SAME REMOTE CONTROL
SO WITH THE SWITCH ONE SINGLE SWITCH
S
YEAH RECORDS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
NO
YEAH
YEAH
IN THE PROJECT UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YES
HALF AN HOUR
YOU'RE FIRED
NO

I RECEIV THE MAIL BUT YOU DON'T
SO
THAT'S IN THE PRESENTATION SO
UH BELOW I BELIEVE
YEAH BELOW FORTY
MM-HMM
OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE IN THE AGE GROUP FORTY PLUS
AND THE NEW PRODUCT SHOULD REACH NEW MARKETS WHICH IS THE CUSTOMERS BELOW FORTY
THAT'S IN A NEWSFLASH
YEAH
BUT IT ALSO NEEDS TO HAVE CORPORATE IDENTITY
PRESENT AND THE COLOURS
SO WE CAN'T CHANGE MUCH OF THAT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
'KAY
IT'S OPEN ALREADY SO YOU CAN USE TO
FIND YOURS

YEAH
SO N IT'S VERY EASY
NOW YEAH IT'S OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH SO MAYBE YOU CAN HIDE THEM OR SOMETHING
YEAH YOU MAKE A SCREEN MENU OR SOMETHING
MM-HMM
YEAH AND THE OTHER OTH OTHER UH FUNCTIONALITY IS THE SCREEN
WHAT DOES THE SCREEN DO

IT'S LOW POWER
SO WHAT DOES THE SCREEN DO
THEY SAID THEY NEEDED IT BUT WHAT DOES IT DO
WHAT DO THEY WANT WITH THE SCREEN
YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE MAKE IT UP
SO BUT WHAT DID THE MARKETING

MM-HMM
YEAH DECODER
BLANK
YEAH OKAY
WORK HARDER
YEAH
UH
'KAY
UM FOR THOSE THAT DIDN'T SEE YET UM THE BASIC NEW REQUIREMENTS OF THE MANAGEMENT WERE NO TELETEXT ONLY FOR T. V.
UH IT SHOULD BE DESIGNED FOR A USE G UH GROUP BELOW FORTY
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S W WRONG IF WE CAN UH TARGET THE CURRENT CUSTOMER GROUP AS WELL
AND UH THE CORPORATE IDENTITY SHOULD BE CLEAR IN THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE FUNCTIONS AND ON THE LET'S SEE WHAT WAS IT UH THE TARGET GROUP
WE HAVE TO MAKE BE CLEAR WHAT THAT IS
YEAH USERS
YEAH SO I THINK IT'S EASY BUT
YEAH IT'S BELOW FORTY SO WE CAN DECIDE WHERE TO
OKAY
SO BELOW FORTY IS OKAY
BUT WE NEED AN LOWER LEVEL WHICH TO S UH FOCUS
SO IS IT FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY
IS IT FROM TWENTY TO FORTY
IS IT FROM THIRTY
YEAH
'KAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
DESIGN
MM
MM-HMM
AND MAYBE Y
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO IS YOU SHOULD HAVE A MENU FOR ALL THE THE FUNCTIONS YOU DON'T USE REGULAR AND WHICH ARE
YEAH
AYE YEAH
SHALL I UH
YEAH
IT'S OKAY
NO IT DOESN'T HAVE LINE CONTROL SO
YEAH WE GET THE
THE REMOTE YEAH
BASIC
IS ON TOP
WHICH SHOULD BE EASY EASILY REACHED WITH THE THUMB
T I S SHOULD SAID RIGHT
BECAUSE YEAH
MM-HMM
DO THE ALSO WITH THE THUMB
SO IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO THAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR UH THUMB ALSO REACH THE MIDDLE
OR YOU SHOULD SCREEN AT THE BOTTOM AND THEN YOU CAN SEE IT VERY CLEARLY
YOU YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO HOLD IT SO
YEAH
YEAH OKAY THAT'S TRUE
LAYOUT
THAT'S FOR THE
I CAN'T HELP IT
YEAH
MAN
YEAH OKAY
YOU WANT THE NORMAL PIECE OF PAPER
AND YOU HAVE A PEN
YEAH
MM-HMM
UH
AND THE FOR FLIPPING UP AND DOWN
YEAH
AND LEFT TO RIGHT
AND THOSE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR THE MENU
YEAH
YEAH OKAY BUT THIS IS FUNCTION SO IF YOU CAN USE THEM FOR MULTIPLE THINGS
FOR THE MENU
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU PUT THE SCREEN
BUT IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT THERE IS A SCREEN
YEAH
AND FOR THE SPEECH UH RECOGNITION PART IF WE WANT TO INCORPORATE THAT WE NEED A MICROPHONE
YEAH
THIS WOULD BE UH
NO THAT'S NOT S SURE SO UH WE NEED A DISPLAY
YEAH
YEAH THEY'RE USED TO IT
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT THEN IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU COVER IT WITH YOUR HAND SO
I THINK THAT TOP IS THE BEST OPTION
YEAH OKAY
DEPENDS ON THE SENSITIVITY OF THE MICROPHONE BUT I THINK THAT'S OKAY
VOLUME
UP
CHANNEL UP AND DOWN AND THE CONTROL OF THE ADVANCED OPTIONS
SO MAYBE IT WE SHOULD DECIDE WHAT ADVANCED OPTIONS WE WANT TO PUT IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH SO SOUNDS
YEAH AND THEY'RE
THEY'RE NOT USED OFTEN SO
YEAH JUST
YEAH SOUNDS
YEAH
OF COURSE
I'M JUST A SECRETARY
COFFEE
TREBLE BASS

MM
YEAH
CONTRAST YEAH
MM
NO
UH SO CONTRAST
BRIGHT
UH
AND THE OTHERS WERE IN YOUR PRESENTATION RIGHT
SO I CAN JUST COPY THOSE
OKAY
IT'S EASY
YEAH THE BUTTON OPTIONS AND THE L. C. D. OPTIONS
INDEED
YEAH
YEAH YOU HAVE BASICALLY A BUTTON MENU WHICH YOU CAN USE DIRECTLY UH ACCORDING TO THE OLD PRINCIPLE
AND THE L. C. D. OPTIONS ARE ACTIVATED BY SOME SOME SOFTWARE OPTIONS THATS COMMUNICATES WITH THE INFRARED UH DECODER YEAH
SO YOU
YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL PROCESSOR AND AND SOFTWARE PART
COMPARED TO O
MM-HMM
L. S
YEAH
COLOUR
YEAH I I CALL IT CONTRAST
YEAH I MAKE IT C COLOUR
YEAH
YEAH AND AUTOMATICALLY UM
MM-HMM
YEAH SO I'VE G CHANNEL PROGRAM IS AUTOSEEK
UH NAME A CHANNEL OR
OH THEY GET AUTOMATIC NAMES OKAY

YEAH BUT CAN YOU ALSO SAY I WANT F UH VERONICA ON THE CHANNEL NUMBER UH FIVE OR
YEAH
YEAH
HOW DO YOU CALL THAT
CHANNELS
YEAH
NINETY NINE OR SOMETHING
YEAH
S SWAP CHANNELS
CAN I CALL IT THAT
SWAP'S GOOD OPTION
OKAY
UH OTHER FUNCTIONS
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL THAT'S 'S UP TO UH MISTER USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
ALSO
THAT'S YOU'RE
YEAH BUT ALSO WHICH BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO PRESS TO GET A CERTAIN RESULT
AND THE WORKING DESIGN WAS TO SPECIFY HOW PH THE PHYSICAL INTERATION BETWEEN THE COMPONENTS WAS AS I BELIEVE
NO I DON'T THINK SO
BUT I THINK THE COMMUNICATION WITH THE TELEVISION IS DIFFICULT
BUT THAT'S NOT OUR PART
WE DON'T HAVE TO DESIGN A PROTOCOL SO
NO THAT'S THE
YEAH
SO BUT
UM
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER CAN DESIGN A MENU
FOR ALL THESE FUNCTION I PUT THEM ON THE
YEAH
YEAH I CAN
I'LL JUST TRY TO REORGANISE UH THINGS
UM
SO YOU DESIGN THE BASIC FUNCTION MENU FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN
UH UM
I THINK TH I THINK THE YEAH THE LAYOUT OF THE SCREEN AND I THINK YOU CAN CONCENTRATE MORE ON THE BUTTON PLACEMENT AND THE PLACEMENT OF THE UH SCREEN ITSELF ON THE
NO I D I THINK THAT'S MORE IN
YEAH
OKAY
SO HE'S LAYOUT AND YOU'RE FUNCTION
FORM FUNCTION OKAY
YEAH
I THINK I THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT YES BECAUSE W HE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT
YEAH
BUT WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND ALSO MAKE CLEAR WHICH BUTTONS TO PRESS TO GET CERTAIN RESULT BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE DIFFICULTY
EVERY DEVICE HAS ITS OWN
MENU OKAY
YEAH
MM
BACK
YEAH
YEAH BUT THEY'RE INCORPORATED
UP AND DOWN IS
SMART
PUT IT ON TOP
MM-HMM
WELL
BUT THAT'S UH J JURGEN'S DEPARTMENT
YOU JUST MAKE THE LAYOUT
YOU DO WE DO THE EXTRA TWO BUTTONS OR NOT
YEAH
YEAH OKAY

AND TO OKAY AND BACK ALSO
AND OF COURSE THE FOUR ARROWS
BUT THOSE ARE STILL Y DOUBLY USED
BOTH THE L. C. D.
YEAH
MENU BUTTON ACCESS THE MENU IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YOU CAN NAVIGATE
BUT YOU CAN ALSO NAVIGATE THE CHANNELS
AND THE VOLUME
THOSE ARE BOTH BOTH YEAH
OH FIVE MINUTES
LIGHT UH
YEAH SURE
OKAY
UM
ANYTHING ELSE
I'VE
VOLUME
WELL WE HAVE THOSE BUTTONS
WE USE ALL FOUR
YEAH OKAY GO AHEAD
YEAH THAT WAS ALREADY DECIDED

NOBODY TOLD ME
NO I TH BELIEVE THERE'S FIRST LUNCH BREAK
YEAH
OR YOU CAN JUST
YEAH
'KAY
I THINK YOU CAN PUT UH THE LAPTOP BACK IN THE ROOM AND
'KAY
YEAH IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
THAT'S OKAY
OH YEAH
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS BUT IT SHOULD BE SAVED
YEAH
IT'S UH
SHOULD BE HERE
SMART BOARD
DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN USE IT BUT
YEAH
I TRY TO ORGANISE IT BY THESE THREE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
I DON'T REALLY MIND
I JUST PUT THE MINUTES HERE AND WE'LL SEE
YEAH THAT'S IN THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UH FOLDER
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S JUST BASICALLY WHAT I JUST SHOWED
YEAH
YEAH I GOT IT BY YEAH
I'M GONNA GET KICKED IF I DON'T DO IT SO
MAKE ME PROUD
YEAH
I BELIEVE SO
JUST ASK

UM IF YOU ALL GO STAND AROUND UH
COMPUTER
UM
NO
OKAY
I UH HAD UH TWO EXAMPLES
UM THIS ONE IS THE THE YEAH THE ADVANCED ONE WITH A LOT OF OPTIONS AND FUNCTIONS AND BUTTONS
THIS THE EASY ONE I THINK WE HAVE TO TO COMBINE THEM
AND UH YEAH MERGE THE BEST FUNCTIONS OF ALL EXAMPLES
UM BUT YEAH THE THE AGE IS UH UNDER FORTY
SO WE
OKAY SO SO WE HAVE THE OPTION FOR MORE FUNCTIONS
UM YEAH
YEAH
UH YEAH THIS THIS ONE WE CAN REMOVE FOR KIDS
IT'S JUST ONLY FOR ADULTS SO UH WE CAN UH USE SOME ADVANCED OPTIONS
BUT
YEAH BUT I PREFER WE WE UH USE THE THE BASIC OPTIONS UH YEAH
WE HAVE TO TO MAKE THEM VERY EASY SO FOR JUST UH ZAPPING AROUND THE CHANNELS YOU CAN JUST PUSH ONE BUTTON
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TO USE YOUR YOUR VIDEO RECORDER OR SOMETHING ELSE YOU SHOULD USE USE AN UH AN ADVANCED OPTION
OKAY ONE DEVICE
OKAY
I DIDN'T SEE
OKAY AND I ALSO UH YEAH
W YEAH
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FASHIONABLE
LIKE YOU UH SAID UH BEFORE
UH YEAH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS
UM YEAH ONLY USE A EXTRA FUNCTION IF THEY ARE REALLY NEEDED
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
DID I UH DID I BREAK IT
FOR FOR THE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS I THINK
LIKE SEARCHING FOR CHANNELS AND
YEAH
OKAY
THAT'S UH I'M AL I'M ALMOST FINISHED SO
UM THE WE HAVE TO TO TO WATCH OUT FOR THE I IF WE MAKE IT F VERY FASHIONABLE IT IT THE FUNCTIONAL FUNCTIONALITY WILL GO DOWN
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE UH A COMPROMISE BETWEEN FUNCTIONALITY AND FASHIONAL FASHIONABLE YEAH CONTENT AND FORM
NOW THAT THAT WAS UH WAS THE END
YES
YEAH
OKAY SHOU SHOULD WE MAKE A LIST OF THE OF ALL THE FUNCTIONS WE WANT UH
YEAH
BUT UH IT'S IT'S ALSO FOR CHILDREN OR JUST UH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
WE WE HAVE TO
AND IF WE HAVE A LARGER PUBLIC WE HAVE UH YEAH MORE OPTIONS TO TO UH SELL OUR PRODUCT
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHY UH I WANTED TO TO MAKE YEAH TWO UH DIFFERENT UH YEAH GROUPS OF FUNCTIONS
THE THE SIMPLE FUNCTIONS FOR FOR THE THE WHOLE PUBLIC AND THE THE ADVANCED OPTIONS FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE YEAH WHO ARE MORE YEAH EXPERIENCED WITH UH
NA
I W I SHOULD UH PUT UH THE THE YEAH THE EXTRA ADVANCED OPTIONS ON THE ONTO THE ONSCREEN DISPLAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
L LEFT TOP OR RIGHT UH TOP
YEAH RIGHT
OKAY
YEAH BUT IF YOU ARE USING THE THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS THE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS YOU NORMALLY PRESS THEM ON THE U YEAH
YEAH
YOU BROKE IT
YEAH YEAH
AND VOLUME CONTROL
YEAH
YEAH
AND DO WE NEED A A LOGO ON OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL OR
ON THE LEFT UH TOP YEAH
OKAY
YEAH MAY MAYBE BECAUSE YOU'RE
YEAH OKAY BUT ONLY FOR THE BASIC FUNCTI IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE ADVANCED OPTION YOU'RE GOING TO PRESS THE THE MENU BUTTON AND THEN YEAH
YEAH
OKAY THE YEAH
THAT'S POSSIBLE
YEAH OKAY
OKAY WE PUT IT ON TOP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IF WE
YEAH IT IT'S JUST A REMOTE CONTROL SO
YEAH
TELEVISION UH ITSELF UH

BUT UH THE THE TELEVISION ITSELF HAS ALSO THE THE OPTIONS BRIGHTNESS AND UH SCREEN COLOUR ETCETERA
SO YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
NO THAT'S
OKAY
ON THE UH YEAH CAN YOU I MAKE A A MAP WITH WITH ALL THE YEAH 'CAUSE IT'S NOW THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF DOCUMENTS

BUT DO I HAVE TO TO UH TO YEAH TO MAKE THE THE MENU LAYOUT ALSO
OR
ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT
YEAH
I I'M GOING TO MAKE YEAH O OKAY
YEAH

UH I THINK WE HAVE TO TO GROUP TO MAKE TWO GROUPS
UM THE ONE GROUP FOR THE FOR THE DISPLAY AND ONE GROUP FOR THE BASIC FUNCTIONS AND
YEAH OKAY BUT WE WE HAVE A M YEAH BUT MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S NOT UH YEAH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE Z ZAPPING UH WITH YOUR UH YEAH REMOTE CONTROL
YOU CAN PRESS THE THE MENU BUTTON AND THEN YOU ARE SUDDENLY INTO THE THE YEAH THE DISPLAY

NO WHAT WAS IT ABOUT
YEAH MY COMPUTER IS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY
YEAH YEAH
NO BUT MY SCREEN IS REDUCED IN SIZE
YEAH
FEEDBACK
OKAY
THIS IS DREADFUL
NO NOT THIS BUT THE TASK
YEAH
NO THAT'S OKAY
NO I JUST FLAPPED IT CLOSED IT TOOK IT HERE AND THEN THIS HAPPENED
AH
UH WHERE WAS IT
IN SETTINGS
OKAY
ALRIGHT
THANK YOU
DO YOU GUYS LIKE YOUR TASKS
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WAS GONNA DO AND THEN A COUPLE OF MINUTES BEFORE THIS I GET MY FUNCTION YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION THAT I NEED
SO FRUSTRATING
SO
YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
THIS PRESENTATION IS MAINLY BASED ON MY OWN IDEAS 'CAUSE I HADN'T TIME TO INTERGRATE THA THE INFORMATION YET SO
REALLY ANNOYING
YEAH
TS
SO THEY DO NEED TO BE IN THE
ALRIGHT
BY THE WAY MY T. V. DOESN'T HAVE AN EQU EQUALISER BUT OKAY
NO
ALRIGHT
BY THE WAY WHERE DID YOU GUYS GET THAT NEWSFLASH FROM
I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING
ALRIGHT
DO WE HAVE UH YEAH
ALRIGHT
IT'S TH THAT'S THE SELF DESTRUCT BUTTON
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
AND WE DO HAVE TO INTEGRATE THE SCREEN AND THE THE SPEECH ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
ALRIGHT
AH LOOK
WE HAVE YOUR UH OH NEVER MIND
OKAY
WELL MY PRESENTATION IS A BIT UH SUCKY
YEAH A LITTLE BIT
UH NO
NO NO
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE IT THEN
I HAVE NO IDEA
THAT W
LET ME CHECK
I KNOW
YEAH
ALRIGHT HOW DO I UH SKIP PAGES
THE KEYS YEAH
ALRIGHT
UM YEAH WELL I WAS WORKING ON THIS BEFORE I GOT MY INFORMATION
SO I WAS JUST WORKING OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND USING MY COLIN COMMON KNOWLEDGE ABOUT UH REMOTE CONTROLS
AND WELL THE INFO ON THE WEBSITE WHICH CAME TOO LATE
UM SO I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONS WE HAD TO PUT INTO IT YET
SO UH UH THIS IS BASICALLY AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED IN OUR LAST UH MEETING
THOSE WERE MY UH STARTING POINTS
UH I WAS WORKING ON A S YEAH ON A SCHEDULE AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO IT LIKE THIS
BUT UM YEAH THEN UH THE INFORMATION CAME AND IT WAS KIND OF EXACT WITH ALL THE STEPS IN THE REMOTE CONTROL THAT I HAD TO FOLLOW
SO I WAS TRYING TO ORGANISE THEM FOR MYSELF
AND THEN MAKE THE THE DESIGN A THE ACTUAL DESIGN BUT I NEVER CAME AROUND TO DO THAT
SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY ABOUT IT
I MEAN EVERYTHING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF I GUESS
MEAN YOU PRESS A BUTTON UM THE IT TRU GOES IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO A CHIP WHICH UH TRANSLATES IT INTO INFRARED SIGNAL OF CERTIN SPATIAL FREQUENCIES
AND UH OR TEMPORAL FR FREQUENCIES ACTUALLY
AND THEN UH THROUGH A UH TRANSFORMER
IT THE SIGNAL GETS BOOSTED AND THEN SENT TO THE TO THE RECEIVER ON THE T. V. AND THE T. V. WILL TRANSLATE IT INTO A FUNCTION
UM
YEAH WELL THIS WAS
ACTUALLY ALL I GOT AROUND TO DO
I MEAN I DUNNO IF I'M TOO SLOW FOR THIS STUFF BUT UH
YEAH
WHATEVER
YEAH SO WHAT WE MIGHT WANNA DO IS UH YEAH CUST I HAVE CUSTOMISED THE SCREEN FUNCTIONS IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
THE UH YOUNGER USERS ARE MORE ACQUAINTED WITH THESE KIND OF MACHINES SO THEY CAN USE MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
BUT MAYBE ELDERLY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT SO WELL SO THEY NEED A SIMPLER REMOTE
AND YEAH THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT THE DESIGN DISPLAYS OR WHA WHATEVER
YEAH
EXPERIENCED YEAH
THE REMOTE
RIGHT TOP
YEAH DEFINITELY
AND MIGHT BE EASIER HUH
YEAH I
YEAH EXACTLY
I THOUGHT BUT THIS IS REALLY YOUR DEPARTMENT THAT WE NEED JUST THE FUNCTIONAL DISPLAY AND FOUR CURSORS
AND
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
WHY DID WE WANNA PUT THE DISPLAY IN THE BOTTOM
OKAY
BECAUSE YEAH IF YOU USE THE FUNCTIONS YOUR HAND WILL BLOCK THE DISPLAY
NORMAL FOR LOGICAL T
YEAH
ON ONCE IT'S ON IT'S ON
YOU DON'T NEED THE POWER BUTTON
YEAH
MAYBE ON THE TOP OR EVEN ON THE SIDE
TRUE
BUT IF YOU UH IF YOU HOLD THE MA THE REMOTE LIKE THIS IF YOU PUT IT ON THE TOP ON THE SIDE I DUNNO
SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK
NEVER MIND
CAN WE LEAVE THIS UP TO YOU
YEAH SO WE WE NEEDED TO INTEGRATE THE SOUND AND UH
AND IMAGE OPTIONS RIGHT
LIKE UH BASS UH SO WE NEED KIND OF AN EQUALISER
IF YOU
YEAH TREBLE MIDDL MIDDLE BASS OR SOMETHING
AH AS
YES PLEASE
THE MONO STEREO OPTION
AND THERE THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE ALSO
AND THEN PITCH
THE FR YEAH THE FREQUENCY OF THE TONES YEAH
YEAH ISN'T THAT THAT DEPENDS ON THE ON THE SIGNAL OF THE OF WHAT PROGRAM YOU'RE WATCHING
AND YEAH IN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE
NO NO OF THE REMOTE UH DO DO WE WANT UH THE BUTTONS TO MAKE SOUND WHEN YOU PRESS THEM
AS A CONFIRMATION OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW
I DUNNO
UNDER THE A YEAH ADVANCED OPTION MENU YOU CAN PUT THOSE THINGS
YEAH
BUT SO WE HAVE WE HAVE T. V. OPTIONS WHICH IS ALL THIS
THE SOUND SOUND AND IMAGE
AND YOU HAVE IN THAT UH THE INDEED THE REMOTE CONTROL OPTIONS
SO WE NEED TWO MENUS KIND OF THING
UH-HUH
ALRIGHT
HELP
WORKING DESIGN
DOCH
HE ONLY HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT HAS TO LOOK
AND HOW
TO USE
YEAH OKAY
BUT
YOU DID YOUR HOMEWORK
BUT UM YEAH
OKAY
NO NO
IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ANY REMOTE
NO
THANK GOD
UH ALL THE FUNCTIONAL UH ASPECTS OF THE REMOTE I THINK ARE IN MY DEPARTMENT
I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IT HAS TO DO
SO IF YOU WANNA YOU KNOW THE CHANGING THE CHANNELS KIND OF S THING IS I HAVE TO INTEGRATE THAT IN THE DESIGN
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD SEPARATION
MM
YEAH WE HAVE TO KIND OF WORK TOGETHER
IF IF I MAKE THE THE THE YEAH THE MENU LIKE
I HAVE TO STATE WHICH FUNCTION HAS TO BE IN THE MENU AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
IT'S IN A IN A WAY THAT B IS USER FRIENDLY
YEAH
I THINK YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YOU WANNA SEPARATE UH
I THINK YOU SHOULD
IT'S EASIER
IF YOU PUT TOO MANY FUNCTIONS IN ONE BUTTON IT GETS CONFUSING
NO
HEY IS IT INTERESTING FOR USERS IF WE PUT LED LIGHTS UNDER THE BUTTONS
SO THAT IF YOU UH PRESS ON THE MENU FUNCTION THAT ONLY THE BUTTONS THAT ARE USED FOR THE MENU ARE LIGH LI LIGHT UP
N
YEAH AND THEN IT'S ALSO EASIER TO INTEGRATE SEVERAL FUNCTIONS IN ONE BUTTON
I THINK NOT
YEAH KEEP IT OPTIONAL 'CAUSE MAYBE YOU CAN YOU KNOW GO LEFT TO RIGHT AND UP AND DOWN IN A IN ONE MENU
THE PR THE PROBLEM WITH THE OKAY BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE IS SORRY
SORRY UH IS UH IF YOU'RE PRESSING UP AND DOWN YOU CAN EASILY PRESS THE OKAY ONCE YOU WHEN YOU'RE NOT ALREADY AT YOUR CHOICE
YOU WANNA CLOSE DOWN HUH
THAT'S OKAY
ALREADY
ALRIGHT
HOW M HOW LONG IS THE LUNCHBREAK
OKAY
MM
THIS IS
YEAH
SORRY FOR MY UH NOT FINISHED PRESENTATION UH
BRING IT ON
ALRIGHT
I'LL TRY TO
SO FIRST WE HAVE A LUNCHBREAK NOW
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
I DUNNO WHERE SHE
YEAH I I JUST SAW IT ONE MINUTE AGO
WHEN I UH
YEAH
YEAH PRETTY MUCH
MM
YEAH THAT'S MY PRESENTATION
MM
OH RIGHT
OOH
WELL
ALRIGHT
HUH
YOU READ THE NEWSFLASH
HMM
WHAT
HMM
ALT DELETE
SO IT DOESN'T DRAW THE ATTENTION AWAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I I HAD A WHOLE IDEA AND THEN JUST WAS TYPING IT AND THEN OH
I HAVE TO DO THAT SO SWITCH
MM
BY YOUR HUMBLE P. M.
YEAH THAT'S FINE
WE HAVE TO START IT RIGHT AWAY
FUNCTIONAL
YEAH FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
ALRIGHT
I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
UM
WELL UH SOME RESEARCH HAS BE DONE UH HAS BEEN DONE
UH OBSERVING OF ONE HUNDRED UH SUBJECTS IN THE USABILITY LAB USING A REMOTE CONTROL
UH AND THEY ALSO FILLED IN A QUESTIONNAIRE
THE FINDINGS WERE UM WELL YOU CAN SEE THEM FOR YOURSELF
THEY DISLIKED THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTES CONTROLS
USERS THINK THEY'RE UGLY
UM THEY DO NOT MATCH THE THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USERS
SO THEY THEY D THEY DON'T MATCH WHAT THEY WANT TO HAVE ON IT
UM THEY ARE OFTEN LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM
UM IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEY'RE BAD FOR R. S. I.
I DON'T KNOW UH HOW A USER CAN REACH THAT BUT OKAY
UM THERE IS ALSO UH WAS ALSO SOME RESEARCH ON UH THE MOST RELEVANT AND AND AND IRRELEVANT UH F FUNCTIONS
UH MOST IRRELEVANT AND LESS USED WERE AUDIO SETTINGS MONO STEREO UH PITCH BASS
UM SCREEN SETTINGS FOR BRIGHTNESS AND COLOUR AND STUFF LIKE THAT
UM BUT THEY ARE USED
I MEAN THE
YEAH THEY DO NEED TO BE ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
I MEAN IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE THE SOUND SETTINGS I MEAN IF YOU DISLIKE A VERY UH LOUD BASS OR SOMETHING YOU YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT
SO UM YEAH WE HAVE TO
WE C WE C
YEAH I MEAN W WE CAN'T MY MY T. V. HAS BUT WE WE CAN LEAVE THEM UH AWAY
UH MOST RELEVANT UH MOST USED FUNCTIONS UH THEY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES I GUESS
UH POWER BUTTON UH CHANNEL VOLUME SELECTION
UH TELETEXT BUT WE CAN SKIP THAT BECAUSE I SAW THE NEWSFLASH
AND TELETEXT IS SO OUTDATED THAT IT IT'S I SHOULD NOT BE USED UH ANY MORE IN THE FUTURE
SO FORGET THIS ONE
UH CHANNEL SETTINGS SO FOR PROGRAMMING UH YOUR CHANNELS IN IN THE RIGHT ORDER
YEAH ON ON THE PROJECT UH
NO SO IT'S A TEXT FILE N IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
SO TELETEXT CAN BE SKIPPED
UM THERE WAS SOME RESEARCH ON NEW FEATURES IN A REMOTE CONTROL
UH ABOUT AN L. C. D. SCREEN UH AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
WELL WE GOT AN UPDATE FOR THE FOR THE AUDIENCE
OR THE THE THE TARGETED GROUP
SO IT'S ABOVE FORTY I GUESS
THE NEW PRODUCT
OR BELOW BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY RELEVANT
I THOUGHT I READ A
YEAH
BELOW
OKAY WELL THAT'S THAT'S IN THE NEWSFLA OKAY THAT'S A GOOD TO KNOW
UM BECAUSE YOU SEE SEE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE AGE GROUPS CONCERNING THE FEATURES
I MEAN UH ABOVE FORTY PEOPLE ARE NOT SO INTERESTED UH NOT SO INTERESTED IN A SCREEN OR SPEECH RECOGNITION
UH BUT BELOW THAT AGE THEY UH THEY PRETTY MUCH ARE
SO I THINK WE CAN BUILD THAT IN
UM
YEAH WELL WE CAN SKIP THIS PART AS WELL BECAUSE I THOUGHT I READ ABOVE FORTY SO WE COULD SKIP THE FEATURES
BUT WE JUST HAVE TO BUILD THEM IN BECAUSE UH THEY FIND IT VERY INTERESTING
UM WELL WE HAVE TO KEEP ALL THE CLASSIC FUNCTIONS BUT MAKE THE BUTTONS AS USER FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE
UM AND AND ALSO THERE'S SO NOT ONLY THE DESIGN OF THE BUS UH BUTTONS BUT O HOW YOU CAN PUSH THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT
SO THE PHYSICAL UH ASPECT OF IT
UM
AND I THINK AND CERTAINLY FOR FOR THE FOR THE LOWER AGE GROUPS UH NICE DESIGN WHICH UH DOES NOT MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL IN YOUR ROOM
IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY A PART OF YOUR INTERIOR OF OF YOUR DESIGN IN YOUR ROOM
SO IT'S THE PEOPLE CAN SAY WELL WHAT'S THAT WELL THAT'S MY REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT'S D IT HAS TO LOOK NICE AND FEEL NICE AND AND HAVE ALL THE FUNCTIONS THAT UH
YEAH SO THE THE LOGO HAS TO BE UH PRESENT YEAH AND THE COLOURS AS WELL
YEAH SO BUT I I DON'T THINK THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE THING HAS TO HAVE A COLOUR ANYWAY
AND MOST OF THE TIMES THERE IS A BRAND PRESENT ON IT
SO I THINK THAT'S NOT GONNA GONNA AFFECT IT VERY UH VERY MUCH
WELL THAT ARE THE THE CONSEQUENCES UH ON A MARKETING UH PART
YES
YEAH
JUST YEAH
SURE
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH AND AND AND MARKETING RESEARCH STATED THAT THAT THAT KIND OF USERS ARE NOT AFRAID OF OF A LOT OF FUNCTIONS
SO NOT NOT TOO MUCH BUT YEAH
AND THE SPEECH RECOGNITION YEAH
YEAH FROM AGE OF SIXTEEN SO YEAH
MM
YEAH BUT UH THE THE NEWSFLASH ALSO STATED THAT IT SHOULD CONTROL ONLY ONE DEVICE ONLY YOUR TELEVISION
SO W
SO THERE ARE NOT EXTRA OPTIONS IN THIS CASE BUT UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WELL WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE SCREEN IS IS ALL THE THE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS YOU CAN PUT THAT IN THE SCREEN
AND THE AND THE YEAH SCREEN MENU TO TO TO UH TO DO THAT AND THEN THE BASIC FUNCTION JUST ON THE DEVICE ITSELF
SO IT LOOKS VERY SIMPLE AND ALL THE ADVANCED FEATURES ARE HIDDEN IN THE SCREEN UH WITH A CLEAR MENU
UH
WHAT ARE WH
WHAT
YEAH WELL IT YEAH IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE SCREEN
WELL I MY GUESS IS IT'S IT'S PRETTY HANDY FOR ADVANCED UH ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
YEAH SEARCHING FOR CHANNELS PROGRAMMING THEM
YEAH
YEAH
WELL YOU CAN IMPROVISE RIGHT
SO WE WE CAN GO FOR
SO WE CAN GO FOR THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE THE LEFT EXAMPLE AND THEN A SCREEN ON TOP OF IT
YEAH
DESIGN
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH FREQUENCY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WE WANT TO INCORPORATE IN UH INTO IT
MM
GROUP OF USERS OR BECAUSE IT SAYS BELOW FORTY I MEAN
I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S THE TAR YEAH UH OR MALE AND FEMALE
UH SIX THE MARKETING RESEARCH STARTED ON S ON THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO UM
HOW DO YOU MEAN
UH SIXTEEN TO FORTY
WELL I I GUESS PEOPLE OF SIXTEEN ARE ARE QUITE USED TO TECHNOLOGY
SO THEY THEY ADAPT TO IT PRETTY SOON I GUESS
YEAH
BUT UH ALL INCORPORATED IN THE SCREEN OR OR JUST ON THE REMOTE ITSELF
YEAH LIKE LIKE YOU HAVE A VISUAL OF THE OF THE BRIGHTNESS WITH WITH A KIND OF SLIDING BAR AND A BUS AND AND STUFF LIKE THAT FOR SOUND AND AND VIS AND AND VISUALS
UH YOU CAN MAKE A IF YOU MAKE A DRAWING
UH
UH
UH BLACK'S OKAY
AND DRAW IT VERY BIG
OH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WELL THIS IS BASICALLY UH IT'S ALRIGHT THE REMOTE
UM WELL USUALLY THE POWER BUTTON IS ON TOP I GUESS
YEAH SO IT SHOULD FIT RIGHT IN INTO YOUR HAND
RIGHT
RIGHT
I MOST PEOPLE ARE RIGHT HANDED SO MAYBE LEFT HANDED SPECIAL ADDITION BUT OKAY
IF YOU PUT IT LIKE LIKE HERE
OR SOMETHING
I DUNNO
UM THEN YOU COULD PUT A SCREEN LIKE ON A MOBILE PHONE ALSO ON TOP I GUESS
OKAY SO Y YEAH YOU HAVE YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND AND THE SCREEN IS BELOW AND THE BUTTONS ARE IN THE MIDDLE
OKAY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PUT THE SCREEN HERE IT'S MORE ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS NOW THAN THE THAN THE LAYOUT
DOESN'T WORK TOO WELL
IT'S UH IT'S BENT
YEAH
RIGHT
OKAY YOU GET IT
UH FOR EXAMPLE IF Y IF YOU PUT ALL THE
RIGHT
YEAH
MAYBE THIS
KIND OF WORKS
LIKE IF YOU HAVE
LIKE UH TEN BUTTONS FOR FOR ALL THE FOR ALL THE CHANNELS UM AND HERE ONE FOR FOR
YEAH THAT THAT USUALLY UH LIKE HERE HERE HERE HERE
SO YOU HAVE UP AND DOWN FOR THE FOR THE CHANNELS AND LEFT AND RIGHT FOR THE VOLUME UH
YEAH
YEAH
AND YOU YOU HAVE MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE ONE BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE
IT SAYS MENU
AND THEN IF YOU PRESS IT YOU THE SCREEN GETS ACTIVATED AND THEN YOU CAN USE THESE BUTTONS TO SCROLL UP AND DOWN AND LEFT AND RIGHT TO GO INTO FUNCTON AND THEN JUST MO MOST OF THE TIME THIS MENU BUTTON IS ALSO LIKE OKAY
TO TO CONFIRM A A KIND OF ACTION
SO YOU SCROLL INTO IT OKAY
YOU SELECT A FUNCTION LIKE V LIKE UH BASS
YOU JUST ADJUST IT WITH THESE TWO BUTTONS
THEN OKAY TO CONFIRM AND THEN UH ON ON EACH ON EACH SCREEN THERE'S THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO GO BACK TO A TO A UPPER LEVEL
AND THEN FINALLY SAY OKAY EXIT
OR OR ONE BUTTON TO EXIT IT
UH IN ONE TIME I DUNNO THAT'S NOT REALLY MY DEPARTMENT
THAT'S MORE YOUR UH YOUR DEPARTMENT TO TO UH TO
YEAH
BUT IT SHOULD BE IF THE SCREEN IS HERE THEN THE LOGO SHOULD BE LIKE ON ON TOP YEAH
I MEAN IT'S UH
YEAH
YEAH I MEAN THE POSITION OF THE SCREEN IS ALSO MORE ESSENTIAL THAN I MEAN WE WE LOOK WHERE WE HAVE SPACE LEFT AND THEN PUT THE LOGO OVER THERE
BUT UM
YEAH SO IT SHOULD BE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND HERE SHOULD BE ON TOP SOMEWHERE MAYBE
I MEAN I
THAT'S NOT SURE BUT IT'S
YEAH I MEAN A SCREEN ON TOP LOOKS MORE LO LOGICAL TO ME
ALSO BECAUSE PEOPLE USE M MOBILE PHONES AND THEY ALSO HAVE THE SCREEN ON TOP
SO YOU YOU JUST HAVE TO REACH A LITTLE BIT FOR THE POWER BUTTON
I MEAN IF YOU GRAB IT
BUT MOST MOST OF THE TIMES IF A IF IF A T. V. 'S ON STANDBY PEOPLE JUST PRESS A CHANNEL TO PUT IT ON
SO WE PUT THIS ON TOP AND THEN MAKE THE CORPORATE LOGO
LIKE OVER HERE
R. R.
AND J AND THE MICROPHONE I MEAN IT CAN BE VERY SMALL
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR MOBILE PHONES ARE SOME STRIPES LITTLE LITTLE HOLES
YEAH MAYBE ON THE SIDE
I MEAN IF THE IF THE MICROPHONE IS GOOD
YEAH OKAY
SO ON THE ON THE TOP IS BETTER
YEAH
YEAH IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT MUCH
SO BUT UM THE SCREEN IS ON TOP
WHICH FUNCTIONS DID WE HAVE LEFT
I MEAN THIS IS BASICALLY NUMBERS VOLUME UH CHANNEL UP AND DOWN
SCREEN IS OVER THERE
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S UH THAT'S A GOOD ONE
YEAH
SOUND
YEAH
EQUALISER
SO IF YOU HAVE SOUND
BUT NOT TOO ADVANCED
I MEAN MOST T. V. S USE ONLY TREBLE AND BASS
YEAH
IT'S UH PRETTY HARD TO WRITE
MM
OKAY BUT YOU HAVE SOUND
YEAH JUST OH Y YOU HAVE DIGITAL UH BETTER WRITE IT DOWN OVER THERE YEAH
SO YOU HAVE SOUND
YEAH
UH YEAH SOUND AND THEN WITHIN SOUND I GUESS TREBLE AND BASS
YEAH
ALSO
PITCH
YEAH
BUT PITCH ISN'T THAT YEAH THAT'S THE THE HEIGHT OF THE TONE
YEAH OKAY WH WHY WOULD YOU USE THAT
IF PEOPLE LIKE TALK LIKE UH
YEAH
PROGRAMMING PART
UH SO WE HAVE SOUND YEAH
CHANNEL PROGRAMMING
MM
I THINK IT G IT GETS ANNOYING
I MEAN MOST MOBILE PHONES USED THAT IN THE BEGINNING BUT
YEAH
YEAH BUT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SIT ON THEIR KNEES ON THEIR KNEES IN FRONT OF THEIR TELEVISION WITH ONLY THREE BUTTONS THEN IT'S VERY HARD TO Y YEAH CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS
YEAH THOSE ARE THE MOST USED I GUESS
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR MONITOR
WELL YEAH WELL I GUESS THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY ONES I GUESS
YEAH
I WILL LOOK IT UP
YEAH WITH THE CHIP AND THEN I MEAN
UH YEAH
WELL YEAH WE HAVE POWER BUTTON WHETHER THAT'S PRESENT
CHANNEL VOLUME SELECTION PRESENT
UH NUMBERS PRESENT
YEAH A AUDIO SETTINGS MONO STEREO PITCH BASS TREBLE
SCREEN SETTINGS BRIGHTNESS AND COLOUR
YEAH CON CONTRAST IS
YEAH OKAY COLOUR AND BRIGHTNESS
UM AND WHAT YOU SAY CHANNEL SETTINGS OR CHANNEL PROGRAMMING
SO YOU YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO TO START SCANNING ALL THE FREQUENCIES AND WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS ONE WELL IT SHOWS ON YOUR T. V.
AND THEN YOU CAN UM
UH AND THEN YOU CAN SELECT UH A NUMBER IN YOUR REMOTE ON WHICH YOU WANT TO SAVE IT
YEAH AUTOSEEK
WELL MOST T. V. S AUTOMATICALLY DISPLAY THE NAME WHICH THEY GET THROUGH THE CABLE
YEAH
SO YOU ONLY HAVE TO CHOOSE THE POSITION ON YOUR
IT ONLY HAS TO MATCH THE THE CHANNEL FREQUENCY ON YOUR T. V. WITH WITH THE WITH THE POSITION ON YOUR T. V. AND AND SO YOUR REMOTE
IF YOU ALREADY PROGRAMMED IT
IF YOU WANT TO MOVE IT
YEAH THAT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TOO
YEAH HOW DO YOU CALL THAT
MM
WAIT YOU YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO BROWSE THROUGH A LIST OR SOMETHING WHICH W DISPLAYS ALL THE ALL THE VALUES ALL THE CHANNELS WHICH ARE POSSIBLE
I MEAN LIKE ONE TO F THIRTY OF OR NINETY OR WHATEVER
JUST BROWSE THROUGH IT AND THEN UM IN SOME KIND OF WAY SEE IF IT IF IT IF IT IS PROGRAMMED
YEAH
SWAP CHANNELS
SO YOU MOST OF THE TIME IF YOU IF YOU SWAP IT
S UH LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE UH R. T. L. FIVE ON ON CHANNEL FIVE
AND VERONICA ON CHANNEL EIGHT AND YOU WANT TO MOVE VERONICA TO CHANNEL FIVE UM MOST OF THE TIMES YOU OVERRIDE THE PREVIOUS UH THE PREVIOUS ONE
YEAH
IT'S IT'S PRETTY UH YEAH I MEAN YOU HAVE TO LOOK ON ON THE MENU
ON THE T. V.
YEAH
OR OR IS IT TOO HARD TO TO JU TO JUST DO IT ALL ON YOUR REMOTE
TO PROGRAMME THE CHANNELS
UH
YEAH
NO
THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
SO WE HAVE A FIGURE A FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TO DO THAT EASILY
I MEAN TH THE AUTOSEEK IS IS NOT A PROBLEM
I MEAN YOU UH YOU UH CURRENT CHANNEL AND THEN THEN IT JUST SAYS UH ON WHICH NUMBER DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THIS
AND YOU JUST PRESS A NUMBER ON YOUR REMOTE AND THEN SAY CONFIRM OKAY AND THEN IT'S IT'S SAVED
IT'S EASIER IT'S IT'S IT'S HARDER TO IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PROGRAMMED IT TO TO SWAP
SO WE HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING FOR THAT
YEAH K KIND OF STRUCTURE INTO LAYERS
SO
AND AND THE LAYOUT OF OF THE THING ITSELF
MAYBE MORE ON
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH I GUESS SO
YEAH
YEAH
WITH WITH SOME L WITH SOME LAYERS IN IT
SO SOME MENUS
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I GUESS THIS THIS BUTTON THE THE THE OKAY MENU OKAY
OR YOU CAN INCORPORATE TWO UH DIFFERENCE UH DIFFERENT BUTTONS
UH LIKE UH FOR YOUR MOBILE PHONE
UM SO THIS IS ONLY FOR TO GET IN THE MENU OR TO EXIT IT
AND THEN ONE TO CONFIRM AND ONE TO GO ONE STEP BACK
SO IT'S LIKE THE THE SAVE BUTTON ON YOUR YOUR MOBILE PHONE IF YOU HAVE A NOKIA OR LIKE THAT
OR THE OR THE NO BUTTON
TO GO ONE STEP BACK YOU IT'S ONLY TWO EXTRA BUTTONS BUT IF IT IF IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE FOR THE SCREEN
YEAH BECAUSE THIS THIS IS USED FOR BOTH
INTO YOUR SCREEN
OKAY
SO YOU L SHOULD LEAVE THE MENU BUTTON OUT OF HERE
AND AND JUST PUT IT UNDER THE SCREEN THE SCREEN
YEAH
BUT WE SHOULD PLACE THE SCREEN ON TOP RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YOU JUST YOU JUST FIND OUT AND
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH OR CONFIRM AND BACK
WHATEVER
YEAH
SHOULD WE SAVE THIS PICTURE OR OR YOU KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
YEAH
THAT THAT JUST TO TO ACTIVATE THE SCREEN
SO
AND THEN WITH THESE BUTTONS WOA Y YOU NAVIGATE
YEAH
L L LITTEN UP YEAH
THAT'S VERY GOOD IDEA
ALRIGHT
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEN IT BECOMES CLEAR WHICH BUTTONS ARE ACTIVE NOW WHICH YOU CAN USE
YEAH
SO
THOSE BUTTONS ARE ARE LIT UP
BUT JUST ONE THING
SHOULD WE USE THOSE TWO
THEM
OR ONLY THIS TO TO SCROLL
AND THEN USE THE TWO FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS TO CONFIRM TO GO INTO SOMETHING
OH NO WE HAVE TO USE THIS TO ADJUST SOME SOME BARS
YEAH
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD USE THIS ALSO AS AN OKAY BUTTON STILL
AND THEN JUST ONLY A BACK BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH
AND ONE BACK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WE HAVE TO ASK
YES
YEAH
TIME PRESSURE
YEAH WE'LL KICK YOUR ASS LATER
NO
UH
AYE
Y YOU SAVED IT
DOES IT SAVE AUTOMATICALLY IN THE PROJECT FOLDER
OR
OKAY
WE'LL SEE
JUST PUT BACK MY LAPTOP
ALRIGHT
YEAH YOU CAN OPEN IT WITH THE PICTURE PREVIEW OR STUFF LIKE THAT
INTERNET
ALRIGHT
YEAH JUST TESTING
MM
ENGLISH
BREAK IS OVER
WHOO
SPICY
SO HE'S COMING
OH OKAY
AH
SHE
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FINAL REPORT 'CAUSE I HAVE TO RECORD EVERYTHING WE ARE DECIDING AND SUCH SO I'M TRYING TO WRITE IT DOWN BETWEEN EVERYTHING ELSE
OH
YEAH
HERE WE GO AGAIN
WELCOME
UH WE HAVE AGAIN THREE PRESENTATIONS AND THEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON WHAT CONCEPTS THE MOBILE PHONE HAS TO UH F THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS TO SUPPORT
SO WHO WANTS GO
YES
YEAH SURE
DOESN'T MATTER
NO
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH SURE
NO
COOL
YEAH YOU'RE JUST THE USER INTERFACE HMM
YEAH LAYOUT
YEAH OKAY
YOU PROBABLY OPENED IT
F. FIVE
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
CALCULATOR'S CAN DO IT
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH I THINK YOU CAN ONLY FIT ONE UH SOURCE OF ENERGY ON THE
YEAH I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY INFO UH
YEAH
S YEAH IT'S SAFE
'KAY NEXT
UH
OKAY
CAN WE UH
YEAH
WELL THE VISUAL REPRESENTATION IS NOT THERE WITH SPEECH BUT YOU CAN
YEAH
JUST YEAH
I THINK YOU CAN JUST UH MATCH THE SPEECH COMMANDS WITH THE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY PRESENT
SO I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO DESIGN ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT
BOTH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT WOULD BE THE BACK
BACK AND OKAY
YOU DID READ THE MINUTES I WROTE
YOU DID READ THE MINUTES I WROTE
OH OKAY 'CAUSE I PRETTY MUCH SUMMED UP ALL THE BUTTONS THERE WERE
SO
I HATE DOING WORK FOR NOTHING
MM-HMM
THAT WAS IT
OKAY
UH
AGAIN
UGH
OKAY SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT KIND OF COMPONENTS DO WE USE
UH ENERGY SOURCE CHIP TYPE CASE TYPE
AND USER INTERFACE
BUT I DIDN'T SEE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE SO I THINK WHAT WE HAVE IS OKAY
SO WE ONLY WE ALREADY DECIDED THAT KINETIC WOULD BE THE CHOICE FOR ENERGY
UH THE CASE WOULD BE DOUBLY CURVED
SO
RUBBER MATERIAL
AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE HAVE LEFT
OH OKAY
NO IT'S EASY
ADVANCED CHIP
OKAY
TOO
UH I DIDN'T GET ANY INFO ON THIS
SO
YEAH
I HAVE TOTAL HERE
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
I DIDN'T GET ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SO
YEAH
WHO DOESN'T
UH LET'S SEE
IS THERE A NEW THING
YEAH THE INTERFACE MAYBE CAN
OOH
NO
UH DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF DOUBLY CURVED CASE
AND COULD YOU PUT THAT IN THE GROUP FOLDER
OF THE PROJECT FOLDER
AH YOU DIDN'T DRAW IT YOURSELF
AH
ARROW
YEAH
'S THE TARGET GROUP
YEAH SURE
YEAH
OH OKAY
I SEE
YEAH ALSO LIKE THIS
SO YOU CAN HOLD IT
THE CHILDREN'S STORY
YEAH I'VE GOT IT
DISTINCTION
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
DIFFERENT
MM-HMM
CAMERA
YEAH SUBMARINE
WELL
YEAH BUT THIS THIS THE IS FOR THE
OKAY
UH
AH YEAH BRIGHT COLOURS
THAT'S SINGLY CURVED
OKAY
WELL WE COULD MAKE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THAT
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT
UH INSTEAD OF DOUBLY CURVED WE TAKE A SINGLE CURVED
SO TO APPEAL A LITTLE MORE TO THE ALL THE PUBLIC
MM-HMM
YEAH
ALSO
YEAH THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH I'D AGREE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
DIFFERENT
STANDS OUT
OR
OH YEAH A ONE HAND UH SOLUTION
CAN TURN IT MAYBE
TO SWITCH FROM BUTTONS TO INTERFACE HMM
IF YOU TURN IT A LITTLE
OH YEAH
LEAST YOU CAN EASILY SEE IT
IF YOU CAN UH FLIP
UH SO YOU HAVE A THE THE SIDE VIEW
SO AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO
MAKE THIS
OKAY SO THE BUTTONS ARE ON TOP HERE AND YOU FLIP IT OVER THAT WAY
YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S GOOD IDEA
YEAH
NO NOT ALL BECAUSE YOU NEED MOST OF THEM THE ARROW BUTTONS
BUT YOU CAN HIDE THE OKAY AND THE BACK UH BUTTON
AND THE MENU BUTTON ALSO BECAUSE WHEN YOU FLIP IT OPEN AND YOU CAN MAYBE EVEN DROP THE MENU BUTTON BECAUSE MAYBE IF YOU FLIP IT OPEN IT WILL AUTO ACTIVATE AMAUTO UH UH AUTOMATICALLY
WHY
YOU COULD JUST MAKE IT MECHANICAL
IF YOU COVER IT WITH RUBBER
MM
YEAH
SO IT CAN BOUNCE
YEAH OKAY SO THAT THAT MAY WORK
OKAY BUT THEN WE STILL HAVE THE THE THE THING OF THE THE THE SHAPE
YEAH
WHAT KIND OF
HARDER
MAYBE CAN DESIGN TWO VERSIONS
MM-HMM
AND ERGONOMICAL SHAPE
YEAH
THE FEMALE SHAPE YEAH
WITH TWO UH
OH YEAH
SOME UH K ESK UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
SO THE KEYWORDS ARE PRIMARY CO COLOURS SPONGEY
YEAH
YEAH
BUTTONS
OKAY
I THINK THAT UH IT'S A NICE DESIGN
IT'S COOL
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S
ORANGE OR SOMETHING
MM
YEAH
HUH COOL
NO IT'S
YEAH IT'S TEXT
N NO YOU HAVE TO EXIT
YOU COULD ALSO MAKE LINE WITH UH YEAH
MM
YEAH
Y
YEAH AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT
SOME YELLOW
BANANA COLOUR
YEAH IF YOU IF FLASHING COLOUR SO YOU CAN'T LOSE IT BASICALLY
WELL I THINK IT'S A BIT TOO MUCH BUT
YEAH
YEAH
WHO
AND THEN YOU CAN USE YELLOW OR SEMETHING
WHY NOT
AYE
LIKE THIS
COLOURBLIND YEAH
NO SO THAT'S MOSTLY RED AND GREEN I BELIEVE
WOAH
ALL ALL BUTTONS
OKAY
IT'S DIFFICULT
BLUE
MAYBE GREEN
YEAH YOU CAN
MM-HMM FLASHY
MM BZZ
RED MAYBE
BLACK
WHY
YEAH
SO
OOH
UH NOT YET
YEAH WITHIN FIVE MINUTES YEAH
Y LEFT YEAH LEFT AND THEN UH I HAVE TO KICK YOU OUT
YEAH YEAH
THEY HAVE LEDS BUT THEY HAVE A COLOUR
YOU CAN MAKE THEM RED
YEAH
BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE LEDS ARE JUST EXTRA LIGHT
UH THEY THEY DON'T DETERMINE THE COLOUR THAT MUCH I THINK
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PRINT ON THEM YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND
EACH NUMBER IS TRANSPARENT
UH PARTLY BUT YOU HAVE TO PRINT ON THE NUMBER
OR THE THE SIGN
SO YOU CAN'T
CHANGE THE COLOUR SO
YEAH
BIT OF LIGHT
BIT OF FEEDBACK
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY WITH
UH
DON'T MEAN TO DISCOURAGE YOU BUT UH BASICALLY
YOU TWO ARE GOING TO WORK ON THE SMARTBOARD
NEXT THIRTY MINUTES TO DESIGN SOMETHING SO
AND THE
YOU WILL DO THE EVALUATION
YEAH
YEAH UH ABOUT
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
YOU PROBABLY GET A MAIL
YEAH
ONCE THEY ARE FINISHED
YEAH
YEAH BUT MAYBE YOU CAN DO THE EVALUATION YOU DON'T HAVE TO EVALUATE YET BUT YOU CAN MAKE A PROCEDURE WHICH TO FOLLOW
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
ABOUT
YEAH
YOU HAVE THE BASIC IDEA
AND YOU TWO UH ARE GOING TO DO THIS
LOOK AND FEEL AND
YEAH
GOOD LUCK
SO I UH MAKE NEW PAGE AND UH BE CREATIVE
YEAH YOU HAVE UH THIRTY MINUTES
THEN WE HAVE TO UH SEE SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN UH
SHOW TO THE MANAGEMENT
I WOULD YEAH
YEAH
NEXT
OH AND SAVE THIS UH BOARD
JUST SAVE IT
YEAH OKAY BUT JUST PRESS SAVE AND UH
IT'LL BE FINE
YOU CAN ALSO INCLUDE CLIP ART
SO IF YOU'LL RATHER DRAW IN PAINT OR SOMETHING
THEN LOOK
YEAH
YEAH
YOU CAN ALSO INCLUDE IT
IT'S NOT MUCH WORK
THAT'S INCLUDED
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
SENSITIVE
I DUNNO
MAYBE JUST START TYPING
YOU ALSO DO THE OTHER SIDES
NOT ONLY ON THE FRONT SI UH THE TOP SIDE BUT ALSO THE THE SIDE VIEW
UH
JESUS
WHAT DO I WRITE DOWN
WHY CAN'T I WORK HERE
THIS IS MUCH EASIER
YEAH
MM
NO SO I JUST WORK HERE A FEW MINUTES
FIVE MINUTES LEFT BEFORE THE MEETING ENDS
YEAH WE KEEP THE FLIP
KEEP THE FLIP LIVE
NO FLIPPING
IT'S SHAKING
YEAH JUST LIGHT ON TOP
SAFER
MM
YEAH OKAY THAT THE TARGET GROUP
WELL
I JUST UH ENDED THE MEETING
YOU TWO GO DESIGN
OH
BY THE WAY
UM
I UH THOUGHT UP A NAME FOR OUR PRODUCT
YEAH
IT'S CALLED UH THE REAL REMOTE
WITH A COPYRIGHT SIGN AFTER REAL
SO MAYBE YOU CAN INCLUDE THAT SOMEWHERE
YEAH
I DON'T SEE ANY POWER CABLES HERE SO
'KAY
GOOD LUCK
OKAY
I I'VE GOT THE SAME PROBLEM AS WELL
OH
NO
YEAH
NO PROBLEM
YEAH
NO
I I DON'T MI I DON'T MIND
THAT'S
DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S BETTER THAN THAN MY UH DRAWING
YEAH OKAY BUT I HAVE TO DESIGN THE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
PUSHBUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AS AN OPTIONAL UH FEATURE
OR COMBINE UH BOTH WITH A WITH ONE UH
OKAY
AND THROW IT
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
ONE ONE UH VERY IMPORTANT THING I WAS UH YEAH THINKING ABOUT IS THE SPEECH UH OPTION
WE WERE GOING TO USE THAT
YEAH
SO UM
YEAH UM YEAH THAT'S ONE THING UH WHICH I'M NOT SURE UH OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT UH INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL
NO OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE COMBINED WITH WITH THE MENU UH FOR FUNCTIONS AND
SO OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
BUT DO UH J DO WE UH DO THE SPEECH JUST FOR THE BASIC OPTIONS FOR THE SIMPLE BUTTONS
FOR FOR EVERYTHING ALSO FOR THE ADVANCED OPTIONS
OKAY
UH WE HAVE THIS VERY UH BASIC UH TRENDY DESIGN
EVERYBODY SAYS IT SO THAT'S WHAT'S UH YEAH UM
YEAH IN THE IN THE LAST UH MEETING WE UH WE WERE YEAH PUTTING THE THE SIMPLE AND THE ADVANCED OPTIONS SEPARATED
THAT'S
YEAH OBVIOUS
UM YEAH
PRESSING THE THE MENU OPTION UH WILL DISABLE UH ALL OTHER OPTIONS ON YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL
AND ONLY THE THE L. C. D. PANEL WILL UH LIGHT UP AND THEN YOU CAN ONLY UH CHANGE THE YEAH THE OPTIONS
YEAH
UM YEAH DESIGN HAS TO BE VERY ATTRACTIVE BUT THAT'S YOUR YOUR OP YOUR YEAH
YOU HAVE TO UH DELETE THIS BUT THIS IS THE THE THE SIMPLE UH LAYOUT
UH DISPLAY ON THE UPPER SIDE WITH THE THE MENU BUTTON AND MAYBE A SOME SORT OF CANCEL BUTTON OR SAVE BUTTON
I'M
THE BACK
BACK AND OKAY YEAH
UH
WHAT
A LITTLE BIT I THINK BUT NOT NOT EVERYTHING W
OKAY
OH I UH DIDN'T READ THAT
BUT
BUT THIS IS THE THE BASIC UH DESIGN UH FOR THE FOR THE M YEAH FOR THE BUTTONS
UM
I WANTED TO TO CATEGORISE EVERYTHING
UH WITH A SPEECH DISPLAY UH YEAH SOUND EVERYTHING YOU YOU NOTED IN YOUR UH MINUTES
UM EVERY PUSHBUTTON HAS UH HAS ITS OWN UH LED LIGHT
SO YOU CAN UH YEAH CHANGE UH M MAKE IT MORE TRENDY FOR FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE
AND UH IF THERE ARE OLDER PEOPLE THEY WANTED MORE UH YEAH MORE UH LUXUROUS SO THAT'S AN A ALSO AN OPTION
UM THAT WAS IT
YEAH
YEAH
WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE IT IN UH CHINA SO IT'S NO PROBLEM
UH IT'S IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL THE OPTIONS UH YEAH
YEAH
THIS IS THE THE MENU I WAS UH LOOKING UH AT
YEAH
ARROW YEAH
YEAH
S YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT HAS ALSO TO IT IT HAS ALSO TO BE UH LUXUROUS UH FOR FOR YEAH RICH PEOPLE
TH THIS LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE LIKE FOR ONLY FOR CHILDREN
SO
YEAH
THE COLOUR
YEAH
OKAY BUT THE THE COLOURS YOU YOU CAN MAKE IT UH MAKE THE COLOURS WITH LEDS UH BENEATH THE THE BUTTONS
IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU CAN DISABLE THE THE COLOUR LEDS FOR FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
VERY CHEAP UH CHEAP LOOK
YEAH BUT IF YOU IF YOU MAKE IT MORE CURVED WE WE CAN MAKE MORE AND MORE OPTIONS FOR BUTTONS
IF YOU HAVE UH IT HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND
YOU YOU YOU ARE NOT ONLY UM YEAH YOU DON'T NEED ONE DIMENSION BUT YOU CAN USE OTHER DIMENSIONS FOR PRESSING THE THE BUTTONS
YEAH
SOMETHING TO SHOOT AT YOUR TELEVISION
YEAH
THAT'S YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
THAT'S THE THE MORE ADVANCED OPTIONS WERE UH FOR THE FOR THE MENU
BUT YOU YOU WANT OKAY
YOU JUST WANT TO HIDE THEM ALL
THE OH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
THAT'S BUT IT'S IT'S NOT
IT'S NOT VERY UH VERY STRONG UH YEAH IF YOU DROP IT ONE TIME
OKAY
BUT WHEN YOU ARE LEFT HANDED THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM
BUT THAT'S THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE UH
YEAH
WE WE COULD MAKE SOME SOME RUBBER UH SOME RUBBER UH YEAH MOUSE WITH WHICH YOU CAN CHANGE UH AND SO IF YOU
YEAH
OKAY
SOME YEAH
NO NO NO NO
OKAY
YEAH
NO THE ARROW'S OVER HERE
YEAH
OR BLUE
DARK BLUE OR
YEAH
YEAH BUT THE PRIMARY COLOURS W WE CAN UH CREATE WITH THE WITH THE LEDS ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
IF YOU WE UH YEAH
IF YOU MAKE IT UH JUST A YEAH BL GIVE IT A BLUE COLOUR THEN IT'S JUST A NEUTRAL COLOUR
ALSO FOR THE FOR THE MORE UH YEAH FOR THE PEOPLE
SO THAT'S
SO THAT'S BLUE
MM
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE A
YEAH
AND WHICH WHICH COLOUR SHOULD UH SHOULD I GIVE THE THE DISPLAY
UH
OR
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE A MAYBE A WHITE A WHITE BACKLIGHT
DARK UH LETTERS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S ADJUSTABLE
YEAH
OR NOT
THAT'S HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT UH MORE TRENDY
OR IS IT UH TOO EXPENSIVE
MM
AND IT IT LOOKS QUITE CHEAP THAT COLOUR I THINK
IT'S IT'S NOT
YEAH
I DUNNO
IT'S IT'S TRENDY OKAY
BUT
MM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THE BUT THE BUTTONS HAVE THEIR OWN LEDS OR NOT
OKAY
OKAY
THAT THAT'S A DEFAULT UH SETTING
THE THE RED BUTTONS
OKAY
YEAH I I WAS THINK ABOUT A RED UH RED LEDS AND BLUE LEDS AND
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT AT THIS MOMENT AFTER TH THIS MEETING
OKAY
YEAH
AH SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE WHAT WHAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT
YEAH L LET'S JUST UH DELETE ALL THESE UH OR
OH NEXT
OKAY
UH
YEAH
AND THEN AFTER THAT WE CAN MAKE THE USER UH INTER INTERFACE
YEAH
YEP
OH NO IT'S IT'S OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT THIS PART ISN'T UH FUNCTIONING PROPERLY
IT'S A BIT UH LARGE
L LET'S MAKE FIRST THE THE THE ALL THE VIEWS
THE THE FRONT VIEW SIDE VIEW AND THE BACK VIEW
YEAH
THE MIDDLE HAS TO BE VERY SMALL SO YOU CAN HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND
YEAH THE DISPLAY WE YEAH WE CAN PUT A DISPLAY
YEAH
THE THE ARROW FUNCTIONS
YEAH
YEAH
NO IT'S IT'S UH IT'S OKAY
YOU CAN MAKE IT M LARGER
MAYBE IT'S EASIER TO TO DRAW UH
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE BASIC IDEA
YEAH
YEAH ONLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT BUTTONS ON THE SIDE OF THE UNIT
THAT'S THE QUESTION
YEAH
FROM THE
YEAH I'M I'M
MAY MAYBE IT'S IT'S EASIER TO TO INTEGRATE THE THE THE L. C. D. SCREEN JUST INTO THIS THIS BUBBLE
BECAUSE IT DO DOESN'T HAVE TO FLIP THEN
BECAUSE WE HAVE EN ENOUGH SPACE FOR FOR MAKING A AN L. C. D
BECAUSE HERE
BUT WHY WHY DO WE NEED UH THE FLIPPING UH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH THE THE SHAPE IS OKAY BUT YEAH
I DON'T SEE THE THE YEAH WHY WHY WE SHOULD USE THE THE FLIPPING UH MECHANISM
BECAUSE WE
OKAY YEAH
IT'S IT'S FOR FOR FOR MORE TRENDY UH
BECAUSE WE HAVE ENOUGH SPACE
H HERE WE GOT UH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS THE THE ARROW UH YEAH BUTTON
YEAH AND THEN H WE SH MM
YEAH THEN IT'S
NO FLIPPING OR YOU WANTED THE FLIPPING SO
BUT IF YOU IF YOU
IF YOU DROP IT IT IT JUST BREAKS
AND IT HAS TO BE VERY STRONG BECAUSE OF THE
YEAH KIND OF
AND IT'S ALSO FOR THE FOR THE CHILDREN IT'S YEAH FOR PEOPLE NOT SIXTEEN YEARS
BUT THERE ARE MORE
YEAH OKAY
THAT'S TRUE
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY WI
YEAH
THE REAL REMOTE
I THINK UH IT'S THE SENSORS
OKAY
YEP
OKAY THAT'S THE SIDE
AH IT'S IT'S OKAY
BUT DO WE WANT UH OPTIONS ON THE ON THE SIDE WITH THE WITH THE BUTTONS
OR JUST LEAVE IT
UH COULD MAKE AN UH A VOLUME BUTTON UH SCROLL VOLUME BUTTON
FOR MENU
OR
YEAH
NO YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH YOU ARE GOING TO DESIGN IT SO
JUST KIDDING
SO ANNOYING
I JUST PUT IT IN THE IN THE SHARED FOLDER SO IT SHOULD BE YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
WHAT OR WHATEVER DOES IT
NO NO NO CAN YOU GO BACK ONE
UH 'CAUSE IT HAS TO BE POWERPOINT PRE YEAH COMPONENTS DESIGN THAT'S IT
I DID GET A BIT MORE DONE THAN THE LAST TIME 'CAUSE I KNEW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TIME SO I JUST COPY AND PASTE EVERYTHING INTO THE
SOMETIMES I HAVE THESE POP UPS OR THESE SOUNDS AND THERE'S NOTHING THERE
AND ALSO WITH I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE POWERPOINT SO IT TAKES ME FOREVER TO GET SOMETHING DONE WITH IT
YEAH
THI
MM-HMM
WHO WANTS TO START
SOUND
YEAH YEAH UH UH
YEAH
AND SHALL I GO FIRST
SO I
YEAH
ALRIGHT
UH COMPONENTS
OH NO
YEAH TRUE
UM
ALRIGHT
SO I'M DEALING WITH THE COMPONENTS DESIGN
UM LET'S SEE
I UH USED SOME DESIGN EXAMPLES WE HAD UH FROM SIMILAR PRODUCTS
AND I USED UH POSSIBILITIES FROM OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT ABOUT CURRENT COMPONENTS WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE DESIGN
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO WANTED TO GO FIRST
WELL THEY GAVE ME UM AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT
WE'RE F MAINLY FOCUSING ON THIS GROUP BUT I WANT TO MAKE THE DISTINCTION CLEAR
UH I COULD NOT DRAG THE PICTURES INTO THE THE SLIDES SO S SO I DON'T HAVE EXAMPLES OF HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
BUT IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT YOU UH WHAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO WITH THE SPONGEY AND THE FRUITY LOOKING UH TYPE
IF YOU THE YOUNG DYNAMIC PEOPLE WANT SOFT PRIMARY COLOURS UH WHICH LOOKS LIKE FRUITS YOU KNOW
YOU CAN AND SHAPES THAT ARE CURVED AND NOT UH SOLID STRAIGHT LINES ANYMORE
SO THIS BASICALLY UM YEAH GOES ON TO WHAT YOU WERE MENTIONING EARLIER
THERE IS A LOT OF UM FACTORS INVOLVED IN CHOOSING THE COMPONENTS
THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS
UH FOR EXAMPLE THE ENERGY SOURCE
WE HAVE FOUR TYPES
THE BASIC BATTERY
UH WE HAVE A HAND DYNAMO WHICH WE YEAH WE DUTCH REFER TO IT AS THE KNEIPGATT
UH THE KINETIC PROVISION OF ENERGY WHICH MEANS IF YOU MOVE THE THING IF YOU SHAKE IT
WHICH WILL BE FUN FOR TODDLERS RIGHT IF THEY WANNA USE THE
AND UH OF COURSE SOLAR CELLS
BUT I DUNNO HOW WE WOULD USE THAT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT
SO UH MY YEAH ALSO ALSO IN YOU KNOW COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S N ISN'T MUCH LIGHT LIKE IN SCANDINAVIA
THEY WOULDN'T BE Y ABLE TO USE IT HALF OF THE YEAR YOU KNOW
SO THAT'S NOT COOL EITHER
SO UM FOR THE UH A CASE THERE'S UH THE TRADITIONAL UNCURVED FLAT HARD CASE
SINGLE CURVED WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAS UH CURVES IN ONE DIMENSION
OR THE DOUBLE CURVED
UM I WASN'T ABLE TO FINISH MY UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES SHEET
BUT WELL YOU KNOW THAT WE WILL HAVE TO GO FOR THE DOUBLE CURVED 'CAUSE IT'S DARING AND DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE NOW
UH THE CASE MATERIALS
WELL WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF HARD UH MATERIALS LIKE THE THE HARD PLASTIC THE WOOD AND THE TITANIUM
I WOULD DEFINITELY GO FOR RUBBER 'CAUSE IT FITS MOST IN WHAT PEOPLE WANNA SEE NOWADAYS
UM POO THIS IS A LOT OF TEXT
I WASN'T ABLE TO ORGANISE THIS YET
WE HAVE YEAH SEVERAL UH INTERFACE DESIGNS
UH WE CAN USE A SCROLL BUTTONS FOR THE MENUS
BUT WE ALREADY KIND OF DECIDED TO GO FOR THE F FOR THE PUSHBUTTONS FOR THE THE ARROW BUTTONS
SO THAT'S NOT REALLY INTERESTING
ELECTRONICS
YEAH MAYBE WE WANNA DECIDE ON WHAT ELECTRONICS TO USE THE ADVANCED CHIP I THINK
IS EASIEST TO IMPLEMENT UH FOR THE PRODUCTION 'CAUSE THEY THEY CAN PRINT IT BETTER
UM
YEAH
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT IT
YEAH I WAS WORKING ON SOME PER PERSONAL PREFERENCES
I FIRST UH CHOSE FOR THE BATTERY 'CAUSE YEAH I'M TRADITIONAL AND THAT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS EASIEST CHOICE TO GO TO
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD MAYBE UH THINK ABOUT THE KINETIC ENERGY WHERE YOU HAVE TO MOVE THE THING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT
YEAH MAYBE WE
I CAN IMAGINE THAT THE KINETIC UH TYPE ENERGY SOURCE WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO MAKE
BUT IT IS MORE LONGLASTING THAT THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO EVER BUY BATTERIES AGAIN
AND IT'S ALSO MORE FUN YEAH
I ALWAYS CHUCK MY UH REMOTE CONTROL AROUND SO
YEAH Y EXACTLY
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SCARED ABOUT BOUNCING IT OFF THE G FLOOR AND BREAKING IT OR WHATEVER
SO THAT'S THE END OF IT
UH GO AHEAD
NO IT MEANS CURVED IN TWO DIMENSIONS
SO UH W SINGLE CURVED
UH LET'S SAY WOULD BE A B SQUARE BOX BUT THEN WITH CURVES ON ONE DIMENSION
AND DOUBLE CURVED WOULD MEANS THAT IT WOULD HAVE CURVES CURVES IN EVERY DIRECTION
LIKE THREE D.
YEAH
DESIGN
I
AND RUBBER
RUBBER MATERIAL
YEAH WE NEED THE THE CHIP ON PRINT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE THE SCREEN AND UH AND F AUDIO FUNCTION
YEAH
YEAH
OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HAVE A SIMPLE CHIP JUST FOR PRESSING BUTTONS
BUT WE NEED MORE
I'M JUST THINKING THIS IS NOT MY DEPARTMENT BUT I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS GONNA COST TO BE ABLE TO M
SO 'CAUSE WE NEED TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE EURO A PIECE
THAT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT HUH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
CHILD LABOUR MAN WE LOVE IT
UM LET ME SEE
WAIT A SEC
YEAH I'M GOING THERE NOW
INSPIRATION
WELL
UM YEAH MAYBE IT'S
MAYBE IT'S EASIER
YEAH
YEAH PERFECT
MAYBE IT'S EASIER IF YOU GUYS COME OVER HERE
S SEE THIS IS THE THE THE STANDARD TRADITIONAL TYPE WHERE THE FORM UH YEAH SERVES THE FUNCTION YOU KNOW
IT'S LIKE REALLY BASIC
BUT THIS M IS MORE APPEALING TO OLD PEOPLE AND WE DON'T WANT THAT
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
AND TH THAT MEANS CURVED IN BOTH DIRE DIRE UH DIMENSIONS
NOT ONLY LIKE THIS BUT IT HAS TO BE EXACTLY
IT HAS TO BE KIND OF INSTEAD OF THE PLAYSTATION THE MODULE
IT HAS TO BE LIKE THE THE GAME CUBE YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR THUMBS WOULD BE LAYING IN THE INSTRUMENT AND IT HAS TO BE NICE TO HOLD
AND
IT HA
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE THE PROBLEM UH YEAH THE DILEMMA ACTUALLY
'CAUSE WE WANNA APPEAL TO THE TO THE YOUNG PUBLIC WITH FANCY WITH FLASHY COLOURS AND WITH A LOT OF SHAPE
AND
YEAH AND THE AND THE RUBBER IT IT WILL LOOK CHEAP ALWAYS YOU KNOW WITH THE
THERE IS MOBILE PHONES IN WHICH YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR ALSO OF THE LIGHTS
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS FUNCTION
TO CUSTOMISE IT AND SO I MEAN KIDS CAN MAKE IT LOOK MORE FLASHY WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLOURS AND PEOPLE WHO WANT SOMETHING YOU KNOW DIFFERENT
OR MORE UH DESIGN THEY CAN GO FOR ONE COLOUR LIKE UH FOR EXAMPLE THIS UH PHOTO TH CAMERA
PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S REALLY UGLY
JUST GIVE ME THE THING THAT IT'S INSIDE THERE MAYBE I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS STUFF
YEAH
SO THOSE I THINK ARE ALL MY OH
AND THIS IS THIS IS WITH THE CURVED THAT I MEAN
YEAH
YEAH
A COMPROMISE BETWEEN WHAT
THIS THIS WOULD BE UH SINGLE CURVED UH
YEAH
YEAH
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
I THINK THE I MEAN OUR AIM IS TO MAKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT RIGHT
TO MAKE SOMETHING NEW
I WOULD GO FOR THE DOUBLE CURVED
AND I I'M I'M THINKING UH YOU KNOW UH A DRAWING PALETTE WHERE YOU HAVE THE SHAPE FOR YOUR THUMB
SO IT KIND OF HOLDS NICELY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL THIS IS REALLY YOUR DECISION BUT
YEAH
AS WELL
YOU CAN MAKE A TRIGGER BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH OR THAT THAT IS THE CONFIRMATION BUTTON OR SOMETHING THAT YOU SCROLL WITH YOUR THUMB WITH THE ARROWS AND THEN CONFIRM
THAT WOULD BE A NICE WAY TO USE IT BUT I MEAN YEAH I'M THINKING BIG ALREADY
AND WE NEED SOMETHING THAT WELL THAT THAT YOU CAN ABLE TO USE IN ONE HAND I THINK
YEAH
HOW ABOUT
MM-HMM
YEAH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN
HOW ABOUT WE DO A UH A POP UP SCREEN LIKE THE LAPTOP
SO THAT THE ONLY THE SIMPLE FUNCTIONS WILL BE VISIBLE AT FIRST
AND THEN IF YOU WANT
YEAH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
NO UH LIKE I WOULD DRAW IT LIKE THIS
LET'S SAY THIS IS THE SIDE VIEW
THAT YOU HAVE A A SCREEN THAT WILL COME UP HERE AND CAN GO DOWN THAT WAY
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
SO THAT IT WOULD COME UP LIKE THAT
YEAH OR PREFERABLY EVEN KEEP THE SIMPLE BUTTONS HERE AND THEN UNDER THE SCREEN EVEN YOU COULD PUT MORE MORE ADVANCED BUTTONS
F FOR THE L. C. D. MENU RIGHT
SO W W
OH
ACTIVATE AND TH THE YEAH
TRUE
TRUE
BUT YOU CAN MAKE A YEAH YOU CAN MAKE A TRIGGER HERE
YOU KNOW A SIMPLE UH WITH A
YEAH
EXACTLY
WELL YEAH THE THE IDEA OF IT WAS IS THAT BECAUSE YOU CLOSE IT YOU COVER THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND IT WON'T BE VULNERABLE TO SCRATCHES OR WHATEVER
AND
EXACTLY
EXACTLY
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CLOSING MECHANISM WON'T BREAK
TH IT'S VERY SOLID YEAH
THAT ACTUALLY WILL OFFER SOME EXTRA PROTECTION FOR THE
YEAH
YEAH I WAS THINKING IF IF YOU HAVE YOUR HAND IT THIS IS YOUR TH
OKAY
IF THIS IS YOUR THUMB AND THIS IS YOUR HAND LIKE THAT
WITH YOUR UH WRIST
THAT YOU THAT IT WOULD BE KIND OF SHAPE LIKE THIS YOU KNOW
SO IT'S EASIER TO HOLD IN YOUR HAND TO Y F
UH YEAH
YEAH OF COURSE
YEAH THEN W THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO TO MAKE IT LIKE THIS
LIKE LIKE YOU DREW HERE
AND MAYBE TH THEN MAKE THIS THICKER ALSO THAN THE CENTRE
GIVE IT I WOULD GIVE IT A FEMALE SHAPE BUT UH YEAH
ANYWAY
OBVIOUSLY
MAKE IT MORE APPEALING TO GUYS
I MEAN
YEAH BUT WE HAVE HARDWARE INSIDE WHICH IS SO IT HAS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF BASIC SHAPE
AND ALSO THE SCREEN YOU CANNOT MOULD IT
YOU KNOW KIND OF THING
YEAH
AND THEN YOU CAN
YOU CAN PLACE THE SCREEN HERE WHICH CAN COME
AND BUT THEN I W I WOULD
I WOULD DO THE ARROWS HERE KIND OF THING
THOSE BUTTONS
AND THE SIMPLE BUTTONS HERE SO THAT
I UH Y EAH THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
THE ARROWS OVER HERE AND HERE THE S SIMPLE UH
OR DO WE WANNA MAKE ITS SHAPE LOOK LIKE A BANANA OR SOMETHING
I DUNNO
YEAH
YEAH WE COULD MAKE
WE SHOULD USE
YEAH W WE NEED VERY PRIMARY COLOURS LIKE BRIGHT RED BRIGHT YELLOW
YEAH
YEAH OKAY YEAH
AND HOW ABOUT SOME UH SOME FLASHING STANDBY LIGHTS
LIKE YOU HAVE ON THE SAMSUNG WELL I DON'T LIKE TO CALL BRANDS PHONES
THE YOU KNOW THAT 'CAUSE I REMEMBER FROM ONE OF OUR FIRST MEETINGS THAT UH PEOPLE LOSE THEIR UH REMOTE CONTROLS OFTEN
SO IT NOT NOT ONLY IN IN THE COLOURS OF THE LEDS THAT WE WANT SOMETHING TO KEEP IT VISIBLE AT ALL TIMES OR
UM
YEAH
EXACTLY
YEAH
YEAH
AS LONG AS YOU LOO USE UH HIGH CONTRAST BETWEEN THE THE BACKGROUND AND THE FOREGROUND COLOUR
SO THAT PEOPLE WITH UH WITH
AND ALSO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE A BIT COLOURBLIND
BUT DON'T WE WANNA MAKE THE BACKGROUND THE THE BRIGHT COLO COLOURS
SO TH THE TOTAL OF THE THING IS VERY BRIGHT
LIKE THE PICTURES I SHOWED YOU GUYS
THOSE THINGS WERE ALL LIKE LIKE BRIGHT RED BRIGHT RED FLASHY
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETHING THAT STANDS OUT MORE
YEAH
THE GREEN
IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY TRENDY COLOUR AT THE MOMENT
DO YOU GET A POP UP IF WE
ALRIGHT
NO THAT'S ACTU
RED AND GREEN ARE ACTUALLY THE B THE EASIEST TO DISCRIMINATE
EVEN FOR COLOURBLIND
THEY WILL SEE ONE OF EACH AS GREY
BUT IF YOU USE UH GREEN ON BLUE THOSE KIND OF COLOURS WILL LOOK THE SAME
I THINK
I THINK SO
YOU CAN WHAT WE SHOULD DO I THINK IS IS MAKE KIND OF A SEE THROUGH PLASTIC BUTTON WITH UH ONE COLOURED LED BEHIND IT
SO THAT THE WHOLE BUTTON WILL SHINE
AS THE COLOUR THE
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT EASY TO USE BUTTONS WE HAVE TO
WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE IT THE SHAPE SO THAT IT'S EASY TO HOLD F FOR BOTH HANDS
BUT ALSO THAT YOU CAN REACH THE BUTTONS WITH YOUR THUMB IF YOU HOLD THE MACHINE
AH RIGHT
SO WE'RE GONNA WORK HERE
ON THIS SKETCHBOARD
ALRIGHT
THANKS
ALRIGHT
THIRTY MINUTES
ALRIGHT
YEAH
SHALL WE UH MAKE A NEW UH
YEAH I JUST MAKE A NEW ONE
ALRIGHT
HUH
YEAH I'LL JUST I'LL JUST KEEP IT THERE
YEAH
UH SORRY
OKAY
CURRENT COLOUR
SO UM
SHALL WE MAKE SOME OUTLINE SKETCHES OF THE BASIC SHAPE FIRST
BECAUSE I I
YEAH 'CAUSE I HAVE TO UH FOCUS ON THE ON THE BASIC LOOK AND FEEL DESIGN
SO HOW IT'S GONNA LOOK
AND YOU HAVE TO THINK UH HOW WE'RE GONNA PUT THE SCREEN IN IT AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS
SO IF I'M DRAWING AND YOU THINK OKAY I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PUT A SCREEN IN THERE YOU HAVE TO CORRECT
UH DO YOU MIND IF I DRAW IN BLACK THEN
FOR NORMAL SKETCHES
SO WE KIND OF WANT THE GIRLISH
FIGURE
I'M NOT SO GOOD AT DRAWING
EXCUSE ME
NO UH UH
HOW DO WE UH UH OR INSERT TEXT
OH THAT'S A BIT BIG
YEAH
YEAH
EX EXACTLY
UH
UH I THOUGHT FOR THE SIDE VIEW THAT THE W THE BASIC SECTION WOULD BE RATHER UH A BIT THICKER THAN THE MIDDLE
WHERE YOU'RE HOLDING IT WITH YOUR 'CAUSE YOUR FINGERS HAVE TO FIT UNDERNEATH AND
EXACTLY BUT THE UH BUT THE UPPER SIDE HAS TO BE A BIT MORE LIKE THAT I THINK
UH DON'T YOU THINK
SO THE DISPLAY WE WILL PUT IN HERE THE BASIC UH FUNCTIONS IN HERE WHERE IT'S MOST REACHABLE
THE
THE TH
EXACTLY
OH
THIS IS HARD
WHAT DO DON'T HAVE TO DRAW IT EXACTLY DO WE
WAIT
LET ME TRY IT ONE MORE TIME
MAYBE I'VE UH IT'S EASIER IF I DRAW IT IN ONCE
OKAY OF COURSE IT WILL BECOME WAY MORE UGLY
YEAH
THIS'LL TAKE FOREVER
IT'S FUN TO WORK WITH THIS PEN
UM SO LARGER
AND YEAH
SO SIDE
'KAY
UM OTHER VIEWS
UH
YEAH
LET'S FILL I FILL IN THE BUTTONS LATER
SO THIS IS GONNA BE FROM THE
UH FROM YEAH YEAH
SORRY
YEAH
YEAH
THE THE IDEA IS THAT IT HAS TO FLIP UP TO HERE
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
TRUE
YOU CAN ADJUST THE ANGLE TO WHICH IT FLIPS
SO IT CAN ALSO FROM THIS ANGLE IT CAN FLIP ALL THE WAY UP TO THERE
YOU CAN FLIP IT UP TO THERE IF YOU WANT
THINK SO
YEAH BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL FEEL WEIRD IF YOU WOULD MAKE THIS SMALLER AND THIS BIGGER OR SOMETHING THAT I DUNNO
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL
IT DOESN'T AIM SO WELL
YEAH YEAH YEAH
DEFINITELY
YEAH I GUESS BUT UH I MEAN MOST VOTES COUNT RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH TRUE TRUE
YEAH
YEAH IF YOU IF YOU'RE GOING FOR THE KINETICS
YEAH
I'M JUST THINKING TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESIGNS ALSO
REMEMBER THAT THE WEIRD POCKETPHONE THINGY WHICH LOOKED LIKE KIND OF A GAMEBOY
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT YEAH
OH RIGHT
ALRIGHT
YEAH
I LIKE IT
OKAY
THIS CAN GO
OH YEAH WE HAVE TO F UH INCLUDE THAT IN OUR DESIGN AS WELL
LET'S SEE
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT
UH
YEAH
I THINK WE DO
YEAH OR J OR ALSO SCROLLING FOR THE M YEAH
YEAH
I DUNNO
WE W KIND OF WANTED TO STICK WITH THE
YEAH I'M JUST THINKING IF WE I WE WANNA MAKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT RIGHT
SO THE WITH THE SCROLL IS IS MORE FUTURISTIC THAN THE STANDARD ARROW BUTTONS
I THINK
HELLO
YES I MADE IT
ENGLISH FROM NOW ON
DRAWING OR
YEAH
OOH IT WORKS
SPICY
WHERE ARE ARE ALL THE OTHER PRESENTATIONS
THE CONCEPTUAL OR
AH
BECAUSE I SEE ONLY MY OWN PRESENTATION YEAH
THIS
I'LL JUST PUT IT IN THERE
OR NOT
AH I CAN'T CUT AND PASTE IT INTO THE OTHER FOLDER BUT
MOVE TO MEETING ROOM
YEAH
YEAH ME TOO
YEAH
YES
ME FIRST AGAIN OR YEAH
ALRIGHT
DID YOU OPEN IT ALREADY OR NO
AH
AH
YES
SO WELCOME TO THE MARKETING PRESENTATION ONCE AGAIN
UM THIS TIME ABOUT TRENDWATCHING
UH WELL THERE HAS BEEN INV INVESTIGATION AGAIN IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET
UH IT SHOWS A NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTS
UH I WILL ADDRESS THEM UH IN A MOMENT
UM FASHION WATCH WATCHERS UH HAVE DETECTED THE TRENDS FOR YOUNG PUBLIC BECAUSE THAT'S OUR PUBLIC
UM WELL FRUIT AND VEGETABLES WILL BE WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THEME FOR CLOTHING UH SHOES AND FURNITURE
AND THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGEY
SO UM THE DEVELOPMENTS I WILL ADDRESS THEM OH YEAH WELL THIS IS THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES LOOKS OF FRESH BRIGHT COLOURS
SO TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA
UM WELL THE DEVELOPMENTS
UH DEVELOPMENT ONE
UH WELL MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROL HAPPENS TO BE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT UH FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL
UM WELL FANCY STANDS FOR AN ORIGINAL LOOK AND FEEL OF THE CASE AND THE INTERFACE
AND THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT A REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICAL UH INNOVATIVE
UM WELL IT STANDS FOR THE USE OF TECHNICAL FEATURES THAT DO NOT EXIST IN CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
I THINK WE PRETTY MUCH COVERED THAT WITH OUR SCREEN AND UM AND SPEECH RECOGNITION SO I DON'T EXPECT THAT TO BE A PROBLEM
AND THE THIRD DEVELOPMENT UM IS THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
UM
WELL THE FIRST ASPECT UH WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SECOND WHICH WAS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE THIRD ASPECT
SO UM THAT KIND OF GETS YOU THIS RATIOS
SO FANCY LOOK AND FEEL UH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT UH POINT OF ATTENTION
UH SO THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN COMBINATION WITH THE SPONGEY MATERIAL
UM WELL TECHNOLOG TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION WE'VE COVERED THAT PRETTY MUCH I GUESS
UM AND EASY TO USE I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE PROBLEM
SO MY POINT OF ATTENTION IS ESPECIALLY THIS PART
THAT THIS WILL BE A CRUX
SO THAT WAS THE MARKETING UH PRESENTATION
I HAD ONLY ONE DOCUMENT LEFT
SO KIND OF THIS
SO A K A SMALL EXAMPLE
KIND OF THIS THIS LOOK
UH NOTHING ABOUT THE BUTTONS BUT JUST SPONGE KIND OF THING AND AND SOME FRUIT AND COLOURS I DUNNO
JUST MADE A QUICK DESIGN
ALRIGHT
YEAH
IT'S OKAY
F. FIVE
YEAH
WI AN INDOORS
OH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I GUESS WE CAN ONLY CHOOSE ONE
YEAH
AND IT'S MORE FUN
YEAH JUST PLAYING WITH IT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MATERIAL'S RUBBER
IT CAN BE DONE I MEAN YOU CAN'T HARM IT SO IT'S A PERFECT COMBINATION I GUESS
YEAH
SO
SO DOUBLE CURVED IS LIKE THIS THIS THIS OR
MM
YEAH
ALSO IN IN HEIGHT
YEAH OKAY
YEAH WITH THE PROGRAMME
AND AND THE AND THE BUTTONS THAT YOU NEED TO CONTROL IT I GUESS
YEAH
BACK AND OKAY
NO
RUBBER MATERIAL
SO THAT'S UH IS THAT IS THAT THE ADVANCED CHIP
WOW
YEAH
ALRIGHT
KINETIC
DOUBLE CURVED
THE COST OF MAKING IT SHOULD BE TWELVE AND A HALF
YEAH SO IT'S CHEAP
UM WELL THE INTERFACE TYPE SUPPLEMENTS
IF YOU GO TO YOUR HOMEPAGE OR SOMETHING YOU SHOULD
GET YOUR OWN INFORMATION
I GOT MY FRESH AND FYOO FRUITY UH PICTURE UH ALSO UH OVER THERE SO
NO
TOO LESS TIME
YEAH ALSO THE MENU
YEAH THAT THAT W
YEAH
YEAH I WAS THINKING OF THAT ALSO WITH WITH A WITH A UH ARROW
SO THAT INDICATES THAT THERE'S AN MENU UNDER THAT MENU
SO
OH YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
COOL
S UNDERWATER UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ALSO A KIND OF RUBBER UH
YEAH
THAT SHOULD BE NICE
SO S
YEAH THERE'S ONLY IN IN THIS DIMENSION
LIKE THIS
SO CURVY OR NOT
YEAH SO WE KEEP IT SINGLY C SINGLE CURVED THEN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO FROM TOP VIEW IT LOOKS KINDA LIKE THIS
BUT FROM THE SIDE YOU YOU CAN HAVE IT ALSO IN A KIND OF SHAPE
MAYBE BECAUSE THE THE SCREEN IS ON TOP YOU CAN HAVE
MAYBE YOU CAN C HAVE THIS KIND OF SHAPE
A LITTLE UPWARDS
SO THAT THE SCREEN IS MORE
TOWARDS YOURSELF SO YOU CAN EASILY SEE YOUR SCREEN
WELL WELL YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND SO IT'S A KIND OF AN ANGLE FROM YOUR EYES TO THE SCREEN
SO THEN YOU HAVE DOUBLE DOUBLE CURVED IN SOME WAY
SO THIS THIS IS SO THE SCREEN IS POSITIONED OVER HERE
OH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THE BUTTONS ARE MORE WELL IT'S VERY THICK NOW BUT
THAT'S UH THAT'S
YEAH
THAT THAT YOU CAN PRESS IT AND THEN IT COMES UP
OR
BUT THEN THE SIDE VIEW CAN BE STRAIGHT
IF YOU HAVE A POP UP SCREEN
BUT I DUNNO IF THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
I MEAN MAYBE IT'S TOO MUCH
OH THE ADVANCED BUTTONS
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO OKAY B BUT YOU HAVE T YOU NEED SOME BUTTON TO FLIP THIS OPEN
YEAH
YEAH AND IT SAYS MENU AND IT FLIPS OPEN AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BUTTONS TO CONTROL IT IN COMBINATION WITH YOUR
TRUE
IT UH C IT CAN GO OPEN
AN ADV AN ADV AND IT WILL BE COVERED IN SOME KIND OF UH THIN RUBBER LAYER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH UH
IT'S VERY NO IT'S VERY STRONG
YEAH
YEAH THE LOWER PART DOESN'T WORK I GUESS SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT OVER THERE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT BUT THAT'S OPTIONAL FOR LATER I GUESS
I MEAN WE HAVE TO MAKE
YEAH WE WE BETTER SO CHOOSE ONE
YEAH SO OKAY WE SHOULD BETTER CHOOSE ONE SH ONE SHAPE
BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THE IDEA SO IT LAYS GOOD IN THE HAND AND THEN ON ON THE SIDE WITH WITH YOUR THUMB
YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN USE YEAH YOU CAN USE THE BUTTON OPTION
SPONGEY
SPONGEY CAN BE REACHED BY MEANS OF
YEAH
AND AND THE AND THE CONTROL THNGS IN THE MIDDLE
THE THE THE ARROWS
YEAH AND THEN NUMBERS
YEAH
ALRIGHT
UH PRETTY NICE DESIGN
YEAH
YEAH IT LOOKS UH PRETTY FANCY
UH BANANAS WIERD SHAPE AND OTHER FRUITS ALSO SO IT'S BETTER TO HAVE UM SOME SORT OF BASIC PRINT AND THEN A FRUIT PRINT IN SOME PRIMARY UH COLOURS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT COLOURS SHOULD THE BASIC PRINT BE LIKE
LIKE SOME SOFT GREEN OR SOMETHING
OR AND THEN
OH YEAH YEAH DARK BLUE AND THEN AND THEN VERY BRIGHT UH A YELLOW BANANA AN ORANGE
UH A GREEN APPLE STUFF LIKE THAT WITH VERY UH BRIGHT TONES I GUESS
SO YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE
YEAH
MM
THAT DOESN'T REALLY WORK
TO DRAW I GUESS
OH
WHAT'S THIS
RIGHT
HM
YEAH
TWO HOURS FURTHER
THICKNESS
OH
OH
WH WHY NOT GO FOR THE TWENTY
YEAH
THAT'S WHAT I CALL PAINTING
SO THAT'S THAT'S A DARK BLUE BASIC COLOUR I GUESS
IT'S PRETTY NICE
AND THEN UH
OH
YEAH WITH SOME SOME YELLOW BANANA
LIKE
YEAH
HOW DO YOU MEAN
SOME SOME
YEAH AN ORANGE
WELL ALRIGHT WELL THIS IS MORE LIKE PURPLE I GUESS BUT IT'S SHOULD BE MORE REAL DARK BLUE
SO THE CONTRAST WITH THE WITH THE FRUIT OBJECTS IS UH PRETTY HIGH
SO UH YEAH
THAT WOULD BE A NICE UH NICE DEVICE I GUESS
I MEAN THE THE COLOUR OF THE BACKGROUND OF THE DISPLAY
AH WELL I DON'T GUESS IT S HAS TO BE A SIXTY UH SIXTY SIX FIVE THOUSAND UH COLOUR SO YEAH TOO EXPENSIVE
SO JUST JUST A A BLUE BLUE BACKLIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
GREEN IS TOO OLD FASHIONED
BUT BLUE BLUE'S OKAY
J
WHITE BACKLIGHT AND DARK
YEAH
WHATEVER WHICH IS VISIBLE
I KNOW YOU SH YOU SHOULD TEST IT UNDER UH UNDER A LIGHT CONDITIONS
I MEAN IT'S HARD TO TELL UH I DUNNO
YEAH
TRUE
WHICH WHICH UH COLOUR SHOULD THE BUTTONS BE
WHY ADJUSTABLE
NO UH
BUT MAYBE I MEAN THEY HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME COLOUR RIGHT
AND IF THE BACKGROUND IS VERY DARK BLUE
YEAH
SO MORE LIKE
DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
UH
MORE LIKE THIS COLOUR
AND THEN THEN YELLOW AND ORANGE AND RED OBJECTS ON IT OR SOMETHING
BUT THEN THEN AGAIN WHICH COLOUR SHOULD THE BUTTONS BE
THE THE PRESS BUTTONS
SHOULD THEY BE WHITE OR BLACK OR
UH
YEAH BUT IT'S PRETTY FRESH ON THE OTHER SIDE
YEAH
MY COUCH IS IN THAT COLOUR
YEAH
WELL IT WORKS PRETTY WELL
AND THEN TIME WAS UP
UH
THAT YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES LEFT OR
SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THAT SHOULD BE PRETTY NICE COLOUR
BUT MAYBE THE BUTTONS ALL BUTTONS IN RED IS MAYBE A BAD CONTRAST FOR COLOURBLIND PEOPLE
BECAUSE THE OF THE GREEN
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
SO RED BUTTONS ARE OKAY
HOW DO YOU MEAN
YEAH
NO THAT'S THAT'S TOO BUSY I GUESS
YOU BETTER BET BETTER BETTER KEEP THE LED AND THE BUTTON ITSELF IN THE SAME COLOUR I GUESS
SO JUST AN EXTRA
BIT OF LIGHT AND ATTENTION
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
OF THE PRODUCT
WHICH WE DON'T HAVE YET
SO WH HOW SHOULD I DO THAT
OH OKAY
OR YOU YOU OR YOU SEND IT TO ME
OR JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO DESIGN IT ON THIS BOARD RIGHT
YEAH
I I PROBABLY GET INSTRUCTION ON THAT HOW TO DO THAT SO I MAKE ANOTHER PRESENTATION I GUESS
I KN I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN IN YEAH SO
I'VE A BASIC IDEA
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT SO THAT'S UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ON THE LEFT
S SO YEAH
YEAH
THIS
UH PRETTY ACCURATE
OH WE SKIP THIS I GUESS
SOUND BUTTON PRESS
LIGHT ONLY BUTTON USER CA USER INTERACTION
YEAH
YEAH
SO THE PL THE PLASTIC PLASTIC BUTTONS ALSO HELP UH BECAUSE OF UM THEY ARE ONLY LIT DURING INTERACTION
SO
WELL IT'S A GOOD THING THAT THE BUTTONS AREN'T UM
WELL THAT THEY ARE PLASTIC BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN LIGHT UP THE LIGHT ON WHEN WHEN THEY ARE USABLE
MAYBE YOU SHOULD DRAW IT VERY LARGE LIKE THIS
OH RIGHT
ERASE
YEAH
MUCH EASIER YEAH
I DON'T SEE A SIGN THAT THE MEETING IS OVER YET BUT
YEAH
OH
WRONG ONE
ALRIGHT
BUT WE WE
I IS IT IF IF THIS IS FROM THE SIDE WOAH
STEADY
BECAUSE THERE THE SCREEN GOES UP LIKE THAT RIGHT
SO THEN IT'S LIKE THIS OR THAT'S NOT CONVENIENT BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE THE SCREEN LIKE THIS AND LOOK LIKE THE IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS
OR DOES IT FLIP ALL THE WAY
IT'S BETTER TO TO HAVE THIS LIKE THIS I GUESS AND THEN FLIP IT LIKE THIS
YEAH
SO W YEAH
BUT WE STILL KEEP THE FLIPPING MECHANISM
YEAH
YEAH BUT MAYBE YEAH BUT MAYBE WE WE SHOULD THEN
YEAH THERE THE MIDDLE
SH SH SHOULDN'T WE INTEGRATE IT
AND THEN LIKE I OH TH DOH
COME ON
SO THIS IS THE SHAPE
OH
IT HASN'T
OKAY BUT THE SCREEN IS A BIT LOWER BECAUSE IF IT FALLS ON THE OTHER SIDE IT DOESN'T FALL ON THE SCREEN
SO THERE'S A LAYER OF RUBBER ON THE SIDE
SO NO FLIPPING BUT JUST NO
THROWING AND THE KINETICS
OH
WE BETTER MAKE WE BETTER MAKE IT LIKE THIS
EVENTUALLY
YEAH
UH THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO HAVE A MOBILE PHONE SO ALSO TO TO DEAL WITH THEIR UH REMOTE UH CONTROL
YES
YEAH
OOH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
GOOD
YEAH
WE SHOULD WORK IN OUR OWN ROOM RIGHT
OR NOT
YEAH
YES
SEE YOU TWO IN HALF AN HOUR UH
OKAY
UH FIRST OF ALL I'LL START WITH THE COSTS BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO INFLUENCE OUR DESIGN
IF YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU AL ALREADY HAD A LOOK OR NOT
BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE
UM I ALREADY TOOK THE LIBERTY TO MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS
AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE FIFTEEN BUTTONS ONE L. C. D. SCREEN ONE ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
WE USE A UH SENSOR THAT'S FOR THE SPEECH
UH WE USE KINETIC ENERGY
AND WE WANTED UH THE BUTTONS IN A SPECIAL COLOUR
OKAY
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD DROP
THE SPECIAL COLOUR OF THE BUTTONS
OKAY
UH
SHOULD WE SWITCH TO A HAND DYNAMO
UH THAT'S THE STILL THE SAME IDEA AS THE KINETIC ENERGY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO USE IT AND DO THINGS
BATTERIES
BATTERIES
YEAH
SO
YOU'RE GOING TO REDESIGN SOMETHING
OKAY SO WE'RE AT TWENTY FIVE
UM
DO WE KEEP THE SHAPE DOUBLY CURVED OR G DO WE GO FOR SINGLE CURVED
MM-HMM
UH
YEAH
UM UH ANOTHER OPTION I SAW WAS TO DROP THE BUTTONS ONE THROUGH NINE
SO YOU CAN'T DIRECTLY ACCESS A CHANNEL BUT INSTEAD USE ONLY THE UP AND DOWN ARROWS
THAT WOULD SKIP NINE BUTTONS AND FOUR AND A HALF EUROS
YEAH
UH THEN WE HAVE LEFT
UH YEAH
WE DO
THEY DON'T NEED SPECIAL COLOURS
FINE
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH SOME MORE MENU OPTIONS
YEAH
OKAY SO MAYBE WE CAN DROP FEW MORE BUTTONS
BUT UM NOW LET'S LOOK
MM-HMM
UH
YEAH SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON UH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
UH YEAH
YEAH
IT'S UH ONE INTEGRATED BUTTON IS FIVE TIMES THE COST OF A NORMAL BUTTON
SO
YOU COULD ALSO DROP J THREE MORE OF THESE WITHOUT LOSING MUCH FUNCTIONALITY
YOU JUST DROP THE OKAY AND THE BACK
OH THAT'S FOR THE SPEECH
YEAH
S S DROP SPEECH RECOGNITION
YEAH THAT'S POSSIBLE
BUTTONS
THAT'S NOT VERY EASY TO USE
YEP
OKAY
BECAUSE IF YOU D LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE NEED A LOT OF YEAH
WE NEED A LOT OF EXTRA BUTTONS
OKAY SO WE DROP THE SPEECH
AND DROP IT YEAH
OKAY
S FO FOUR LESS EUROS
SO WE STILL HAVE THREE AND A HALF EURO TO LOSE
YEAH IF YOU LOSE THE THE BACK THE OKAY BUTTON UH V LET'S SAY WE ONLY HAVE THE FOUR ARROWS AND THE MENU BUTTON
THEN YOU'RE
OH AND THE POWER BUTTON WE HAVE ALSO
YEAH
SO THAT'S ONE EURO
YEAH
YEAH
AND
THAT WOULD SAVE ZERO POINT TWO EUROS COMPARED TO NO
YEAH
TO THIS TOGETHER IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OOF IT'S ALMOST THE SAME AS T KEEPING THIS
AND WE CAN DROP THESE TWO
VOLUME
AND THE POWER BUTTON
THAT'S THE BASIC
YEP
OKAY TH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S ONE EURO MORE EXPENSIVE
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION
MENU POWER
FOUR ARROWS
POWER
UH
YEAH
OKAY
SO FOUR ARROWS
UH POWER I BELIEVE
UH
WE HAVE A BACK AND A OKAY BUTTON
AND THE MENU
YEAH AND EVEN IF WE DROP THREE BUTTONS FROM HERE WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AROUND HERE
SO
THE L. C. D.
YEAH
THEN I RATHER MAKE IT WOOD
BECAUSE THEN ALSO IT'S GOOD IN THE MARKET WITH THE FORTY FIVE PLUS UH PEOPLE
NO THAT MAYBE NOT
BUT MAYBE IT'S BETTER THAN PLASTIC ANYWAY
YEAH
YEAH OKAY UH
YEP
YEAH YEAH
YEAH OKAY
PLASTIC
UH THAT'S EASY BECAUSE PLASTIC IS FREE
YEAH OKAY
UH IF WE DROPPED UH
YEAH
YOU STILL NEED THAT
S
NO I KEEP THE RE YEAH
YEAH
BECAUSE WE ALREADY DESIGNED FOR IT
SO
YEAH AND SOMETHING ELSE
NO Y YOU WOULD REC
THEN YOU HAVE
THEN YOU STILL NEED TWO ADDITIONAL BUTTONS I BELIEVE
FOR THE VOLUME
YOU CAN USE THOSE YEAH
OH YEAH AND POWER
THAT'S THREE BUTTONS AND THIS WOULD COST
YEAH
THREE
UP DOWN OKAY
YEAH OKAY
IT WOULD SAVE ENOUGH YEAH YOU CAN CHOOSE THIS DROP THESE THEN WE HAVE A HALF EURO LEFT
SO WE CAN MAYBE STILL USE POWER BUTTON
YEAH
YEAH
YOU SEE
OH STILL YEAH
OH THEN I MISCALCULATED
OH YEAH
SHIT
DROP THE SPECIAL COLOUR
'KAY
WHAT ELSE
UNCURVED
YEAH
THEY MADE IT VERY EASY FOR US
AH I DON'T THINK I CAN S UH PERSUADE THE MANAGEMENT TO SAY THIS IS BETTER FOR THE MARKET SO YOU SELL MORE THAN
BUTTONS
THAT'S OH YEAH SINCE WE ONLY HAVE ONE BUTTON
I JUST M I DON'T I THINK UH YEAH IT'S I THINK IT'S GREY REGULAR
GREY AND RUBBER
OF PLASTIC
YEAH
YEAH
NO I DON'T THINK THE CURRENT STATUS OF UH CHIPS ARE PRETTY UH ENERGY CONSERVING NO
YEAH HAND DYNAMO
DO YOU WANT AN EXTRA BUTTON
YEP
INSTEAD OF AN ADDITIONAL POWER BUTTON
YEAH
IT'S FOR SCROLL
WITHOUT
YEAH BUT IT'S JUST A SCROLL WHEEL WHICH YOU CAN PUSH DOWN
SO
YEAH
SO WOAH WE'RE WITHIN BUDGET
IT'S A MIRACLE
YEAH
OKAY
UM WELL
'KAY THIS WAS OLD
YEAH BACK TO WORK
UH
DID I SAVE IT
YEAH
I I WANTED TO GO BUT I WASN'T ALLOWED
SO
UH I JUST FORGOT TO SAVE THIS
JUST A MINUTE

HMM
OH
OKAY
UM
WELL WE FIRST SHOULD HAVE HAD A UH PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
BUT WELL AS YOU SAW THAT HADN'T MADE NO SENSE BECAUSE WE HAD TO DROP IT
UH
YEAH
YEAH IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT SO I JUST
PUSHED UP THE AGENDA
UH
EVALUATION CRITERIA
YOU HAVE T PRODUCED SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
UH YOU PUT IT IN THE
YEAH
F. FIVE
ALT UP
FREAKY
YEAH
UH OF COURSE WE DROPPED A LITTLE BIT OF THOSE UH
MM-HMM
TWO
UH Y WE SHOULD FILL THIS IN NOW
YEAH OKAY
UH
YEAH IN THE NEW DESIGN I S WOULD SAY IT'S THREE
BUT NOW IN ORIGINAL DESIGN I SAY TWO

YOU SAY YOU DOUBLE CLICK ON THE
NO NOT ANYMORE
BECAUSE HE'S NOW HAVE A SCROLL WHEEL THAT YOU CAN PUSH IN

UM
OH NO
NO N I I ALREADY DID IT
IT'S NOT MUCH
IT'S JUST ONE QUESTION
YEAH
NO THAT'S THAT'S FOR THE TRENDY UH FEEL AND LOOK

EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO WITH WITH THE MENU
SO WITH THE DISPLAY
YEAH
SO YOU DO ONE INTE YOU CAN DO ONE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON
AND THEN JUST DROP ALL THE OTHER BUTTONS
BUT BUT TH THE COST OF ONE INTEGRATED BUTTON IS FAR MORE THAN A FEW EXTRA PUSH BUTTONS
YEAH
SO WE HAVE TO TO MAKE IT S UH MORE UH IT HAS TO BE
COULD DROP THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
WE WE D
YEAH
YEAH
WE LOSE OUR WHOLE CONCEPT
UH SO NO WE JUST WE KEEP THE L. C. D.
YEAH
IF WE DO UH TWO INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTONS WE CAN DROP ALL THE THE PUSH BUTTONS
WITH WITH ONE UH INTEGRATED BUTTON WE CAN UH DO THE WHOLE MENU THING
WITH THE OTHER WE CAN DO THE THE CHANNEL THE VOLUME ET CETERA
NO IT'S THREE EUROS
NO
UM
NO IT'S IT'S N YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
IT'S THE
LET'S MAKE THE LET'S MAKE THE CASE PLASTIC
YEAH
BUT
PLASTIC WITH A WITH A SPECIAL COLOUR
A WOO WOOD UH WOOD UH WOOD COLOUR

YEAH TH TH IT'S IT'S UH
AN ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
OH THAT
BUT THE
BUT THE INTEGRATED UH BUTTON
HOW MANY FUNC FUNCTIONS CAN IT UH HAVE
OKAY
OH NO

WH WHAT WE COULD DO IS UM
DROP THE THE SPECIAL COLOUR AND UH DO THE SPECIAL COLOUR FOR THE BUTTONS
YEAH
JUST SOMETHING ELSE THAN THAN BLACK OR WHITE I THINK

YEAH
SO IT'S IT'S NOT

THAT'S THE DETECTOR UH FOR THE
OKAY
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'S NOT WORKING BECAUSE IT'S MORE
YEAH
OH
OH YEAH
YEAH
YOU'VE TO MAKE IT S UH
NINETY DEGREES
YOU HAVE
OH WE'RE ALWAYS LONG
YEAH CAN WE T CAN WE GET TO THAT I
OH IT'S NOT WORKING ANYMORE
OH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH IT'S IT'S WORKING IT'S WORKING
YEAH
WE'RE IMPROVING UH YEAH
YEAH
NO IT
SO CAKE
NO
NO
YEAH
YEAH
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE FIRST MEETING
AND
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT ONLY THE THE FINANCIAL PARTS UH YEAH
YEAH
FINISH MEETING
I THINK THE POWERPOINT IS IS TOO LIMITED
YOU CAN'T UH DRAW EASY IN IN POWERPOINT
IT HAS TO BE UH YEAH
THE DRAWING BOARD HAS TO BE INTEGRATED INTO POWERPOINT SO THAT YOU CAN JUST EASILY
YEAH
YEAH JUST FOR TEXT FOR TEXT IT'S UH IT'S OKAY
BUT
'KAY
OKAY
OH
OKAY
DID YOU DO YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE ALREADY
UH
IT WANTS
YEAH BUT EVERYTHING IS
JUST A NORMAL BATTERY THEN YEAH
OH MY GOODNESS
WELL I GUESS I WE'LL HAVE TO GO FOR SINGLE CURVE THEN
I MEAN WE HAVE TO DROP ON EVERYTHING
YEAH
HOW ABOUT SORRY
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING
A A
AND UH 'CAUSE THEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO N THEY DON'T NEED SPECIAL COLOUR AS WELL
THAT WAS EXACTLY MY POINT
LIKE LET'S DROP ALL THE BUTTONS AND JUST MAKE ONE I MEAN WE'RE GONNA USE THE L. C. D. SCREEN ANYWAY
SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO USE IT FOR EVERYTHING
AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE AN OVERVIEW OF CHANNELS IN THE SCREEN AND SELECT A CHANNEL CLICK
YEAH WE NEED ONE INTEGRATED BUTTON FOR EVERYTHING THEN
YEAH
KIND OF
I WAS BECAUSE
YEAH
IF YOU IF YOU GO TO IF YOU GO TO OUR UH VIEW LIKE YOU IF YOU ARE IN THE SOUND SYSTEM THERE
UH AND YOU WANNA ADJUST THE TREBLE FOR INSTANCE THIS IS JUST UH AN EXAMPLE
Y Y YOU WANNA SEE A BAR ON WHICH YOU CAN ADJUST IT FROM ZERO TO TEN FOR EXAMPLE
BUT YOU WANT A SOUND PREVIEW OF HOW IT'S GONNA SOUND RIGHT
SO YOU WANNA CLICK ON IT ACTIVATE IT WHE AND WHEN YOU MOVE IT HEAR THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TREBLE COMING OUT OR GOING INTO THE SOUND
SO YOU'LL YOU'LL NEED A A KIND OF A JOYSTICK UH BUTTON
YEAH
EXACTLY
YEAH IT'S R YEAH
NO
NO BUT
YEAH IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT UH WE NEVER CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITIES OF UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
'CAUSE IT CAN TAKE THE FUNCTION OF A LOT OF UH UH BUTTONS
I
NO
YEAH BUT LETS JUST SAY THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION WORKS
WE UH WE WE HAVEN'T REALLY INTEGRATED THIS THE SPEECH INTO THE SYSTEM SO WE CAN MIGHT AS WELL S DROP THAT
WE NEED TO LOSE SOME BUTTONS
WHICH THAT'S EVEN
YEAH IF YOU IF YOU GO TO EIGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
YEAH WE NEED THE CHIP FOR THE FOR THE L. C. DISPLAY
YEAH
TRUE
OH
HMM
YEAH UH
YOU UH UH
YEAH
SO THE OTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO GO FOR THE THE SAMPLE SPEAKER AND WHICH CAN USE A REGULAR CHIP WH WHICH IS SIX EUROS IN TOTAL
THAT DOESN'T MATTER
WELL YEAH
EXACTLY
YEAH BUT THE UH CAN'T WE F UH FIT ALL THE BUTTONS IN AN INTREG INTEGRATED SCROLL PUSH BUTTON
'CAUSE THAT WILL SAVE US ONE AND A HALF EURO ALREADY
AND THEN IF W
TH THEN WE HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH A LOT OF MENUS TO BE ABLE TO GET WHERE YOU WANT HUH
AND UH
YEAH D AT L YEAH
AT LEAST ONE FOR POWER
OH
YEAH IT'S JUST AS EXPENSIVE AS WHAT WE HAVE NOW
YEAH ENDLESSLY
I MEAN IT CAN BE A POWER BUTTON AS SOON AS IT POWERED ON
YOU CAN GO INTO YOU IN YOU MAIN MENU YOU CAN CHOOSE UH FLIP CHANNEL UH YOU CAN CHOOSE SOUND OPTIONS ANY OPTIONS
YEAH
MAYBE WE SHOULD
'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MONEY AND W WE WANT THE SCREEN
I GUESS WE HAVE TO
WE'LL WE'LL BE ON
YEAH IT SAYS RIGHT HERE
YEAH
BUT WE DEFINITELY WANT THE THING TO BE A SPECIAL COLOUR THOUGH
DAMN
YEAH AND THEN
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
WELL YOU ONLY HAVE TO POWER IT UP WHEN YOU WANNA USE IT
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORT
WE ONLY HAVE
YEAH BUT
WELL WE COME BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD THEN HUH
IT'S SILLY 'CAUSE WE WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS MEETING BEFORE WE START DRAWING
OH YEAH
OKAY
DROP EVERYTHING
YEAH
WE WENT STRAIGHT INTO FINANCE
FOR YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
I THINK IT DOES
BECAUSE THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE YOUNG USER WAS ALSO DEFINED IN COLOUR AND SHAPE AND THE USE OF L. C. D. RIGHT
YEAH
WELL WE HAVE EXTENDED MENUS ON THE ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN
SO
I
NO
YEAH
YEAH ALRIGHT
YEAH YEAH
DEFINITELY ONE
IT HAS TO BE
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND THEM
YEAH THE NEXT NOT SO MUCH SO
YEAH
YEAH IT'S UH IT'S INTEGRATED
E EXACTLY JUST LIKE A M MOBILE
WELL UH WE SHOULD B BUILD IT SO THAT IF YOU DON'T KIND OF PUSH INTO THE MENU OR SOMETHING
IF WHEN IT'S ON YEAH IT'S TURNED ON
IT AUTOMATICALLY HAS THE THE PROGRAMME AND THE VOLUME FUNCTION
BUT AS SOON AS YOU CLICK IT YOU GO INTO THE MENU OR SOME OF YOU OR YOU DOUBLE CLICK IT
NO BECAUSE IT HAS FOUR ARROWS RIGHT
OH YEAH
YEAH I WAS THINKING STILL ABOUT OUR UH INTEGRATED JOYSTICK
SAY
YEAH THAT IS A BUMMER
WE'LL MAKE IT A MORSE CODE
YEAH
YEAH I WOULD GO FOR FIVE OR SIX YEAH
OKAY FIVE
LET'S NOT DISS OUR REMOTE
YEP
JUST ONE BUTTON
BUT UH YEP
WE STILL HAVE THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRINT
FR OH I MEAN THE OH NEVER MIND
I'M A BIT LOST
IT'S WAY MORE PRACTICAL YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO WE STILL UH WE STILL HAVE THE PRIMARY COLOURS
BUT ONLY ON THE ON THE OUTSIDE NOT ON THE BUTTON
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH STILL WE WE DROPPED ALSO ON THE THE DOUBLE UH CURVE
AND AND COLOUR
YEAH
S
YEAH
UH
ACTUALLY WE D WE DIDN'T DO SO WELL ON THIS ONE
BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY AN OLD ONE UH WITH LITTLE CURVE ON THE SIDE AND IN A DIFFERENT COLOUR
STILL IT'S STILL HARD
I MEAN THE SPONGE LIKE AND THE THREE D. SHAPE THAT WOULD GIVE IT SOMETHING YOUNG AND FRESH
OF COURSE
YEAH BUT IT BE BECAUSE UH WE COULDN'T HARDLY DRAW ON THE B S ON THE LOWER HALF OF THE SCREEN
WE COULD NOT MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY DRAW IN THE
SO I MEAN I WANTED TO PUT DIGITS ON THE BUTTONS AS WELL
BUT
HELL YEAH
IF WE HAVE ONLY ONE BUTTON
AND EVEN THE SHAPE WE HAVE NOW UH SIMULATES KIND OF AN R. AND THE REVERSED R. DOESN'T IT
SO
NO
THE ONLY E THE ONLY THING EASY ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE YOUR FINGERS
'CAUSE IT HAS ONLY ONE BUTTON
YEAH EXACTLY
I WOULD SAY SIX
IT'S REALLY NOT EASY TO USE
'CAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING EVERYTHING
MOST VOTES COUNT
UM
DEFINITELY IN CASING 'CAUSE WE HAVE A HARD PLASTIC YEAH
YEAH BECAUSE THE THE BATTERIES THOSE THINGIES LAST FOREVER
AND THE THE CASING HARD PLASTIC ALSO LASTS FOREVER
SO I WOULD GO FOR ONE
OKAY YEAH
OH
NO M
I WOULD G I WOULD GO FOR FOUR
BECAUSE WE KIND OF TRIED TO BUT WE KIND OF FAILED WITH THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S IT
AH WE CAN DO THE MATH
UH
YEAH
DID YOU MAKE THIS QUESTIONNAIRE OR WHAT
OH
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT THAT FAST
F
PRETTY DIFFICULT
JUST TYPE IN THE DIGITS
THEY'RE ALL ONE DIGIT NUMBERS RIGHT
AND THEN YOU CAN COUNT THEM TOGETHER
ELEVEN
FIFTEEN
SIXTEEN
SEVENTEEN
OH WHAT
HOW HARD IS THIS
NEVER MIND
TWENTY FOUR
TWENTY EIGHT
TWENTY EIGHT
YEAH THE LOWER THE THE LOWER THE SCORE THE BETTER RIGHT
YEAH BUT
BUT
I ARE YOU SURE WE THIS NUMBER ACTUALLY TELLS US SOMETHINGS
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE SOME QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO POSITIVE ISSUES AND SOME TO NEGATIVE
SO IF YOU GIVE A TRUE TO A POSITIVE IT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT THE LOW THE LOWER THE BETTER
BUT IF YOU GIVE TRUE TO A NEGATIVE QUESTION
NO
DURABLE THAT'S GOOD
EASY TO USE

PRODUCT EVALUATION

YEAH CAN WE DO IT UH UH CAN WE DO A PRINT
I THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE YEAH
OKAY SPECIAL COLOUR
WE DO HAVE SPECIAL COLOUR
DOES IT MEAN UH THAT
SHALL WE JUST GIVE IT SOME DOTS TO MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY
PURDY

THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THAT BUTTON
IT'S SO CUTE
DOH
IS THAT THAT
HOW THE WE DID WE DO THAT
WE CAN TRY
THAT DOESN'T RESPOND ALSO TO THE UNDO
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
NO
WHERE DO YOU WANT SOME MORE DOTS
OKAY IT'S NOT THE PRETTIEST I KNOW
IT'S NOT SO RANDOM HUH
YEAH OKAY
WE CAN MAKE A L A LOGO
LIKE UH PUT IT LIKE THE SHAPE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I MEAN IT'S NOT TOO UH
THAT'S NOT THEIR LOGO IS IT
YEAH
IT'S A
HOW SHALL WE DO THE LOGO IN BLACK OR NOT
ARE YOU DISSING MY DRAWING
THIS ONE
IT LOOKS LIKE A RIBBON
SO WHO WANTS TO DRAW
THIS IS ACTUALLY QUITE FUN
DO WE NEED TO DO ANYTHING
I HEAR YOU PEOPLE ARE TYPING
OH OKAY
IT'S ALMOST FOUR
AT FOUR YEAH
THIS IS REALLY BIZARRE
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A IT LOOKS LIKE A BUTTERFLY
NO BUT IT I IT'S NOT A BU A BEAMER
B IT'S A NORMAL T. V. SCREEN KIND OF THING
OH
YEAH THERE IS SOME KIND OF PROJECTION I THINK
WITH A WITH A MIRROR HUH
OR SOMETHING
YEAH
SO ARE WE GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING TO THIS
I MEAN IS IT GONNA
THIS IS GONNA BE FLAT
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
YEAH
AND THIS IS ALSO GONNA BE
NOPE
BUT SOMETIMES THEN UH ALL OF A SUDDEN IT DOES WORK
MAYBE
NO IT'S I THINK YOU ONLY NEED TWO POINTS
OR NOT
NO YOU SH
SLANTED YEAH
YEAH
WELL MAYBE
YEAH IT IT MATTERS FOR THE AIM OF THIS THING
YEAH
YEAH IT'S ONLY A BIT LIKE TO THAT SIDE BUT THAT IS THAT ONE BY THE WAY
'CAUSE THIS ONE MAKES THE ANGLE EITHER LIKE THIS
SO I IF I CHANGE THIS IT WILL GO THERE IF I CHANGE THAT WILL GO THERE
MM-HMM
I WILL TAKE THIS AWAY 'CAUSE IT LOOKS MESSY
MAYBE WE WILL
WHAT'S THIS ANYWAY
IT LOOKS LIKE CANDLE WAX
UH TH UH DO YOU MEAN THE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN US
OR
YEAH WELL AT FIRST I WAS REALLY STRESSED
BECAUSE IT WENT A BIT FAST
BUT THEN AS I KNEW THE TEMPO THAT I HAD TO BE ON THE SECOND TIME I THINK I DID A BIT BETTER
AND THE THIRD TIME YEAH I MEAN
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH WE
MM-HMM
YEAH
DEFINITELY
WELL YOU DID BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE THE THE SECOND TIME ROUND SO THAT YEAH
YOU WERE MORE IN CHARGE KIND OF THING
I GUESS SO
I MEAN
I
WE WERE PRETTY DEMOCRATIC
YEAH
MAYBE YEAH
IT'S UH IT'S THE THE PEN IS MORE INTUITIVE 'CAUSE WE'RE ALL USED TO WRITING WITH PEN
AND UH AS I SAID UH I UH HAVE NO IDEA HOW POWERPOINT WORKS
SO WILL TAKE ME HALF A DAY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A NORMAL POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
BUT ONCE I GET TO KNOW THE PROGRAM PROBABLY I MEAN IT LOOKS BETTER YOU KNOW
OR UH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU CAN
GIVE IT A KIND OF A HOME STYLE LIKE WE HAVE I
THE THE LOGO AND EVERYTHING
AND I DON'T KNOW
YEAH THE THE THE PROBLEM WITH POWERPOINT FOR ME IS THAT YOU HAVE TO I PUT IN THE PRE MADE CHUNKS C AS WELL
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DRAW SOMETHING ON THE SKETCH BOARD AND THEN TAKE IT THERE OR WHATEVER
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
WELL S SEE YOU IN A SECOND HUH
YEAH WE HAVE TO PULL IT THIS WAY HUH
WAIT
OH
NO
OH
NO
YEAH BUT YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE THAT
SO JUST DO NORMAL BATTERY
YEAH
IT HAS TO BE TWELVE AND A HALF
OR NOT
UH YEAH
BUT WE CAN KEEP IT SINGLE CURVED WITH UH TOP VIEW STILL CURVED
BUT FROM THE SIDE IT'S IT'S FLAT AND THE SCREEN SCREEN IS JUST WELL YOU JUST HAVE TO HOLD IT LIKE THIS THEN
SO
ALRIGHT
LET'S DO IT THEN
YEAH
WE
F. EIGHT
YEAH
THE JOYSTICK
INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON YEAH
YEAH OR OR THE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON
SO THAT'S KIND OF ON YOUR MOUSE AND THEN YOU CAN CLICK IT ADJUST IT CLICK AGAIN AND THEN YOU'RE OUT OF IT
BUT YOU STILL BUT YOU THEN STILL NEED TO HAVE
WELL YOU CAN USE THE SCROLL WHEEL AS WELL FOR UM MAYBE FOR THE CHANNELS
BUT YOU STILL UM
YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME SOME BUTTON IN THE MENU TO GO BACK
YEAH
WELL NOT ALL
NOT S NOT SOUND I GUESS
MM
YEAH
WH WH WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE UH SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER
SPEECH RECOGNITION
RIGHT
BUTTONS
NO IT CAN BE DISTURBED BY BY NOISE AND
STUFF LIKE THAT
LET LET LET ME SEE WHAT'S MORE WHAT'S MORE POPULAR
I GUESS THE THE SCREEN WAS MORE POPULAR THAN UM THAN THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
I HAVE TO LOOK ON THAT
LET ME SEE
UH WELL NO I WAS WRONG
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WHO LIKE SPEECH RECOGNITION THAN AN L. C. D. SCREEN
BUT IF IT
BUT IT IT IT'S A IT'S A BOTH A HYPERS
NO BUT WELL WE YEAH WE KEEP THE SCREEN
I MEAN IT'S IT'S ABOUT THE SAME
EIGHT ONE TO NINETY ONE PERCENT UH SIXTY SIX TO SEVENTY SIX
YEAH
LET'S DROP THE SPEECH
SIXTEEN EUROS
BUT Y Y
YEAH
YEAH
AND THEN AND THEN USE UM
THE THE OKAY
AND THE MENU BUTTON DOES ALSO DOES THE OKAY FUNCTION THEN
AND THEN WHEN YOU IN THE MENU
S SO SO YOU ACTIVATE THE MENU
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
WELL OKAY
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE F F FOUR BUTTONS CHANNEL UP AND DOWN UH VOLUME LEFT RIGHT OKAY I'VE I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT
AND THEN AND THE POWER BUTTON
SO THAT'S FIVE
THAT'S BASIC
THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED ANYWAY
AND THEN FOR THE MENU UM YOU CAN HAVE A BUTTON THAT ACTIVATES MENU
OR D OR DO WE JUST INTEGRATE AN AN AN SCROLL WHEEL WITH A PUSH BUTTON
AND THEN IF THE MOMENT YOU USE THE SCROLL WHEEL THE THE THE MENU GETS ACTIVATED
AND THEN YOU CAN SCROLL CHOOSE AN OPTION CLICK ON IT IT GOES INTO AN FEATURE
CLICK ON IT AGAIN SELECTS FEATURES SCROLL ADJUST IT
CLICK AGAIN IT'S OKAY
THEN YOU ONLY NEED ONE BUTTON TO MOVE BACK
OR OR UNDER EACH OPTION YOU SET A YOU SET AN A SCREEN THING WHAT SAYS BACK
AND YOU SELECT THAT ONE CLICK AGAIN AND YOU GO ONE STEP BACK
AND IN THAT MENU SCROLL CLICK ONE STEP BACK
SO THAT THEN YOU NEED FIVE BUTTONS AND ONE INTEGRATED SCROLL WHEEL PUSH BUTTON
BUT WE CAN'T DROP THREE BUTTONS
BUT I SEE THAT'S YEAH
SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA
BECAUSE WHICH BUTTONS DO WE HAVE NOW
THOSE FIVE WHICH I MENTIONED AND THEN MENU AND THEN
YEAH
F OF THE FOUR THINGS
YEAH TH POWER
WHICH MORE
YEAH
POWER
TH YEAH THAT'S FIVE
YEAH OKAY THAT'S SEVEN AND ONE TO ACTIVATE THE MENU YEAH
SO OKAY THAT'S EIGHT
WELL WE CAN'T REDUCE THAT
WE WE KEEP THE DISPLAY
OH WELL OKAY
YEAH
YEAH WELL WE NEED THE ADVANCED
INSTEAD OF R
YEAH BUT BUT THAT'S NOT OUR MARKET
AH NO HARD PLASTIC
YEAH PLASTIC WITH SPECIAL COLOUR
NO BUT I I BECAUSE WE HAVE TO USE THE SPECIAL COLOUR ANYWAY
YOU FORGOT THAT
SO LET'S GO FOR THE PLASTIC
AND SINCE IT'S NOT KINETIC IT DOESN'T HAVE TO FLIP AROUND THAT MUCH
WE STILL HAVE PROBLEM OF TWO EUROS
YEAH WE CAN'T DROP THEM
DO WE REALLY NEED THAT ADVANCED CHIP FOR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
OH
I RATHER KEEP I RATHER KEEP THE DISPLAY
SO THE ONLY OPTION IS AN HAND DYNAMO
OH NO THA OH THAT'S ONE EURO RIGHT
AND THEN INTEGRATED S YEAH BUT THAT WOULD MAKE IT NOT SO EASY TO USE
I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT EASY TO USE BUT
YEAH
YOU YOU PRESS IT FOR LIKE THREE SECONDS
THEN THEN THEN YOU SHOULD DO EVERYTHING IN THE MENU
ON THE SCREEN
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE'D ALRIGHT
IT S IT SAVES US FOUR EUROS AND IT COSTS US TWO AND A HALF
SO LET'S SEE WE WE DROP THE PRICE BY ONE AND A HALF
BUT WE STILL HAVE THIRTEEN LEFT
THIRTEEN
SO STILL HALF
THERE GOES THE SPECIAL CO WELL THAT WOULD MAKE IT LESS APPEALING
SO THAT'S NO OPTION
WE SURE ABOUT THE ADVANCED CHIP WE NEED FOR THE DISPLAY
WELL YEAH
YEAH
WE MADE IT HARD FOR OURSELVES WITH THE DISPLAY BUT IT'S A COOL FEATURE
YEAH BUT I MEAN WHAT IS MEANT BY SPECIAL COLOUR
S YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH
SO I RATHER HAVE AN HAND DYNAMO THAN THAN DROP THE COLOUR
YOU CAN STILL PLAY WITH IT THEN I GUESS
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH BUT A HAND DYNAMO COSTS A LOT OF ENERGY TO KEEP THE SCREEN WORKING
SO I GUESS THAT ISN'T AN OPTION
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH TRUE
LET'S LET'S GO FOR THE HAND DYNAMO THEN
OR OR DO WE OR DO WE DO UNCURVED AND FLAT
INSTEAD OF
YEAH IT HAS TO BE CURVED AND HAS TO HAVE THAT COLOUR
AND A SCREEN
YEAH
S WHAT WHAT IS SPECIAL F OH YEAH SPECIAL FORM
MAYBE THAT'S NICER
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS
SO DO D UH MAKE IT A SPECIAL COLOUR THEN
YEAH MA MAKE IT A SPECIAL COLOUR THEN
OKAY
MAKE IT A SPECIAL COLOUR AND THEN IT LOOK FANCY
SO
YEAH
LET'S LET'S SAVE IT
YEAH
LET'S DO IT LIKE THIS I MEAN BECAUSE IT DOES NOT LOSE OUR IDENTITY OF THE PRODUCT AS WE
YEAH ALL YOUR DESIGNS ARE UH PRETTY MUCH
YEAH BUT THAT BUT THAT'S THE FUN PART OF IT
ALRIGHT
YEAH WHAT'S THE NEXT UH PHASE
UH THE AGENDA
BY YOUR HUMBLE P. M.
OH F FRUSTRATED
ALRIGHT
YEAH
DROP YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT THAT'S YEAH
I UH I SURE DID
AND IT COMBINES WITH PRODUCT EVALUATION
UH SO
WE ALL HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHAT HAS CHANGED NOW
SO WHAT WE HAVE LEFT ON THE BECAUSE EVALUATION IS BASED ON THE INITIAL UH USER REQUIREMENTS
ALRIGHT
LET'S MAKE IT BIG
UM
WELL WE EVALUATE UH THE DESIGN WITH A SEVEN POINT SCALE AS FOLLOWING
WELL THE REMOTE CONTROLS ACCORDING CRITERIA BLAH BLAH BLAH
TRUE OR FALSE AND THEN ON A SCALE OF SEVEN POINTS A SCALE AS WE ALL KNOW IT
UM
WELL THE CRITERIA ARE BASED ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS UH THE TRENDS FROM THE MARKETING RESEARCH AND THE MARKETING STRATEGY OF THE COMPANY ITSELF
UM WELL THEY ARE IN A WORD DOCUMENT WHICH I WILL OPEN NOW
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW IT'S OPEN YET
NO
AND WE ALL HAVE TO UH AGREE ON A CERTAIN LEVEL
WHAT'S THIS
OH
I DON'T KNOW
UM
WELL THE FIRST POINT IS THE REMOTE CONTROL MATCHES THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE YOUNG USER
SO THAT MEANS THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR WAS USING QUITE A LOT OF FUNCTIONS
HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
YEAH THE US U
IT IT IT'S IT'S MAINLY CON MAINLY CONCENTRATING ON A LOT OF FUNCTIONS IN THIS QUESTION
SO DO YOU THINK
YEAH
YOU CAN YOU CAN MA YEAH YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF EXTENDED MENUS
THAT'S TRUE
I MEAN THE THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ALMOST UNLIMITED TO TO BUILD IN MENUS IN THE SCREEN
SO ON A SCALE FROM
ONE TO SEVEN WHAT DO YOU THINK
HUH
TWO OR THREE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL WE HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE
SO UH WHAT DO YOU SAY
I AGREE ON TWO
YEAH
I UH I SAY TWO PERSONALLY
BUT
YEAH WELL WE HAVE TO EVALUATE I GUESS WHAT WE HAVE NOW
YEAH
YOU SAY THREE AND YOU YOU SAID AL ALSO THREE
THREE
OKAY WELL I SAY STILL TWO BUT IT HAS TO BE THREE THEN
YEAH I KNOW
SO IT'S MADE BOLD
BUT IT'S NAH IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR ON THE SC MAYBE OTHER COLOUR YEAH
THAT'S BETTER
UH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
OH IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BOLD ANYMORE
ALRIGHT
YEAH
UM WELL THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS WHA
THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS IRRELEVANT OR LESS USED FUNCTIONS
FOR EXAMPLE AUDIO SETTINGS AND SCREEN SETTINGS
YEAH
WELL YEAH
SO IT IT'S A VERY TRUE POINT
I MEAN IT HIDES ALL THOSE FUNCTION
BUT I MEAN UH THEY'RE HIDDEN IN THE SCREEN
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THEM YOU DON'T S YOU S JUST SCROLL OVER THEM
AND YOU PLACE THEM
F I DON'T KNOW WHERE
SO THAT'S VERY TRUE I GUESS FOR OUR CASE
UH THE SECOND POINT
IT SHOWS THE RELEVANT AND MOST USED FUNCTIONS
POWER BUTTON
DO WE HA STILL HAVE A POWER BUTTON
WELL YEAH THE BUTTON'S INTEGRATED HUH
YEAH WE DROPPED IT
YOU J YOU JUST PUSH IT IN FOR YEAH JUST JUST PUSH IT IN FOR TH FOR THREE SECONDS OR SOMETHING AND THEN YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
UM IT SHOWS THE RELEVANT AND MOST USED FUNCTIONS
YEAH UH ON THE OTHER UH ON ONE SIDE I WOULD SAY YES AND THE OTHER SIDE I WOULD SAY NO
SO IT'S I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
WITH THE SCROLL BUTT YEAH AND THEN SAY CHANNEL
AND THEN
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT BUT HOW DO YOU CHANGE FROM VOLUME TO CHANNEL
NO
NO WE HAVE N WE HAVE NO BUTTONS LEFT
SO THE JOYSTICK WAS NOT AN OPTION
SO SO YOU HAV SO YOU YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE CLICK I MEAN
FOR I MEAN UH VOLUME AND THREE DOUBLE CLICK FOR THE MENU OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
BUT BUT EASE OF USE WAS NOT VERY IMPORTANT MAY I REMIND YOU
SO THAT'S YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S NOT A QUESTION
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOWS THE RELEVANT AND MOST USED FUNCTIONS
WELL I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH IN THE MIDDLE
YOU HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THEM IN IN THE IN THE S IN THE SCREEN IN THE MENU
SO
SO MAYBE IT'S MORE LIKE A F A FIVE
OR
YEAH
FIVE OR SIX
FIVE
ALRIGHT
YEAH
OH
YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
UH THE THE REMOTE CONTROL MAKES USE OF TECHNOLOG TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION LIKE L. C. D. SCREEN AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
WELL YEAH BUT WE DROPPED THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
BUT IT HAS AT LEAST ONE INNOVATION
I SAY TWO THEN
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THIS QUESTION
UH THI UH THAT'S THE OTHER QUESTION
THIS ONE
TWO YEAH
I THINK L. C. D. 'S MORE USEFUL THAN SPEECH WHAT
OH NOT THE BOLD ONE
RIGHT
OKAY IT HAS A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL BY USING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRINTS PRIMARY COLOURS AND SPONGE LIKE MATERIAL
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TWO QUESTIONS
I REALISE NOW BECAUSE SPONGE LIKE MATERIAL IS DROPPED
BUT THE LOOK AND FEEL
YEAH
THE BUTTON HAS ALSO COLOUR
YEAH
YEAH
THE ONE
MM MM
YEAH WE HAVE SINGLE CURVE NOW AND NO AND NO MATERIAL
SO MAYBE IN THE MIDDLE OR SOMETHING
YEAH I MEAN IT'S
WORTH THE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO DROP THE SCREEN
OH RED
YEAH
YEAH
I LIKE BOLD
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL DISPLAYS THE CORPORATE LOGO
YEAH
YOU JUST HAVE TO DRAW IT
YEAH
BUT THERE'S UH ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE CORPORATE LOGO
I MEAN IF THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
YEAH
SO I WILL SAY THAT IS VERY TRUE
YEAH
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS EASY TO USE
WELL I WOULD SAY SKILL UH I WOULD SAY SIX OR SOMETHING
I DON'T THINK IT'S EASY TO USE OR NOT SO
YEAH
YEAH
IT IT IT HAS A NICE SCREEN
BUT YEAH
YEAH
WELL I I WOULD SAY A FIVE OR A SIX
WHAT DO YOU SAY
EASY TO USE
FIVE OR A SIX
SO A SIX MORE
YEAH UH I WOULD GO FOR THE SIX TOO
SO
UM WELL ANOTHER QUESTION UH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS DURABLE
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE CORRECT WORD
BUT UH
IN USE BOTH BATTERY AS CASING
YEAH
TRUE TRUE
AND THE CASING IS PLASTIC
YEAH
IF YOU DON'T DROP IT TOO MUCH IT'S UH SHOULD LAST PRETTY LONG
YEAH
BUT UH I THINK RUBBER COMPARED IS BETTER
SO I THINK A TWO IS MORE APPROPRIATE
THAN
YEAH
LOGO
OKAY I WILL GO GO FOR TWO
UH THE LAST ONE
THE REMOTE CONTROL'S A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR COMPANY'S MOTTO WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
UH TURN AROUND
YEAH
BUT UM
YEAH
IT'S NOT
YEAH TRUE
SO A FOUR
IT'S IT G IT G GOES IT'S NOT THE BEST WE COULD DO I GUESS
BUT IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT THE BAD IDEA WE HAD SO
ALRIGHT YEAH
RIGHT
SO IF I UNDERSTOOD IT RIGHT WE HAVE TO COUNT THESE NUMBERS
UH
YEAH
MM-HMM
OH
OH ALRIGHT
WORD DOCUMENT THE YEAH WE HAVE TO COUNT THEM
UH
YEAH JUST ADD THEM AND THEN UH DIVIDE THEM
YEAH
MM
I ALL MADE IT PO I I ALL MADE IT I ALL MADE IT POSSIBLE UH FOR A POSITIVE QUESTIONS SO WE CAN COUNT IT
I MEAN IF YOU HAVE REVERSED QUESTION YOU HAVE TO REVERSE THE SCALE UH YES
YEAH
THANKS
OH EASY
QUESTION NUMBER FOUR YEAH
YEAH
HOW HARD IS IT
YEAH JUST USE OH THERE THO UH THERE'S NO N THERE'S NO NUM PADS
IT'S A IT'S A BIT UH
YEAH
I THINK YOU CAN JUST COUNT THEM BY A UM LET'S MOVE OVER
THREE PLUS ONE FOUR
NINE
UH YEAH
ARE YOU HERE
ELEVEN
FIFTEEN
SIXTEEN YEAH
NO SIXTEEN
UH SIXTEEN PLUS SIX
TWENTY TWO
TWENTY TWO YEAH
TW
TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT
TWEN UH OKAY
BY NINE
THAT'S UH THREE UH OR LE LESS THAN A THREE
YEAH
TWENTY EIGHT
DI DIVIDED BY NINE MAKES THREE POINT ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE
YEAH
YEAH BUT THERE ARE NO NEGATIVE QUESTIONS I GUESS
GOOD EXAMPLE
DURABLE USE
EASY TO USE
THIS IS GOOD
FANCY LOOK AND FEEL THAT'S GOOD
TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION WAS GOOD BECAUSE OF A MARKETING UH REQUIREMENT
RE RELEVANT MOST USED FUNCTION
AND HIDES THESE FUNCTIONS
THAT WAS ALSO A GOOD THING
AND THEN MATCHES THE OPERA OF THE USER WAS ALSO A GOOD THING
SO IT WERE ALL POSITIVE QUESTIONS BY UH BY PURPOSE
SO
YES SO THE IT TELLS US SOMETHING YES
BECAU BUT THE PICTURE WOULD BE A LOT DIFFERENT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DROP THOSE UH THOSE THINGS I GUESS
YEAH
NAH IT IT'S IT'S BETTER THAN AVERAGE BUT
YEAH
SO TH
YEAH
NO
THE COLOUR AND THE SCREEN
YEAH WE WE HAVE TO MAYBE IF WE HAVE TO REDESIGN IT ON THIS
WITH SOME CASING AROUND IT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OH YEAH
YEAH
DO WE HAVE TO DO OTHER THINGS
OR JUST REDESIGN
ALRIGHT
YEAH
SO YOU MADE A START RIGHT
YEAH
ALRIGHT
THE THE TARGET GROUP HAS A WEAK SPOT FOR FRUIT AND VEGETABLES LIKE PRIMARY COLOURS SPONGY SHAPE
THE PLAYFULNESS WE DECIDED TO USE KINETIC ENERGY AS A POWER SOUR
OKAY
THAT'S CONCEPTUAL YES
MM
HOW MANY PAGES
ALRIGHT
Y YOU HAVE YOU HAVE DONE THE FIRST TWO
OKAY AND AND THE LOOK AND FEEL IS
YEAH
THE ITEMS WE HAD TO DROP
WHERE DID WE START WITH PRICE
TWENTY SIX AND A HALF
OR NOT
OR TWENTY SIX
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THIS
SPECKLES
UH
YEAH
YEAH
SOME SOME BIG DOTS
YEAH
WE HAVE THE ORIGINAL BALANCE SHEET OR YEAH
WOAH
JUST CUT
CONTROL Z.
YEAH
YEAH
JUST DUAL SCREEN
VERY NICE
YEAH
Y Y YOU YOU YOU PUSH THE BUTTON OR SOMETHING
OR

IT'S CALLED THE REAL REMOTE RIGHT
MAYBE MAYBE IT C IT CAN SAY THAT
THE REAL REMOTE

JUST COMPARE UH
NO IT'S ON THE ON THE BEAMER I GUESS
YEAH
STRANGE
THIS SOMETHING WHAT'S PROJECTION FROM BEHIND I GUESS
YEAH IT IT'S A BEAMER BUT THEN WITH A WITHIN A MIRROR YEAH
SO IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG SCREEN BUT IN FACT IT ISN'T
WELL IT'S IT'S SINGLE SINGLE CURVED
TH THIS IS FLAT
YEAH
BUT IT'S IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IN THE FRONT THIS KIND OF SHAPE BECAUSE IT LOOKS NICE
I MEAN YOU SEE MORE OF THIS THAN OF THAT
YEAH MORE LIKE THAT
IT'S NOT VERY UH IDEAL
DO LIKE THIS
YEAH
WHAT'S THIS
OOH
BUT I DON'T SEE A DETECTOR OVER THERE
I THOUGHT IT WAS A KIND OF THING TO PUT IT ON AND THEN DRAW RIGHT LINES OR SOMETHING
YEAH
OR JUST MESSED IT UP
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT WASN'T GOOD
YEAH IT IT HAS TO TOUCH THE CORNERS I GUESS
BUT TH THIS ONE WASN'T GOOD BECAUSE IF I WAS DRAWING HERE I DREW A LINE AND THEN IT CAME OVER HERE
OH

YEAH ESPECIALLY IF F F IF YOU SEE UH YOU SE YOU SAW THE LARGEST DIFFERENCE FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND MEETING I GUESS
YEAH
YEAH
LI LIMITEDED AFTERWARDS BUT
IF IF YOU DON'T TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR CREATIV CREATIVITY
ALSO NOT ONLY THE DRAWING AND THE THE MAKING OF THE THING ITSELF BUT ALSO IN EXPLAINING IT TO THE OTHER PEOPLE BY MEANS OF UH
THE THE BOARD AND UH POWERPOINT AND WORD AND STUFF LIKE THAT
MM UH I THINK IN IN ESSENCE
THE DIGITAL PEN IS BETTER THAN THE SMARTBOARD
BECAUSE IT IT IT JUST WORKS BETTER
I MEAN UH UH I'VE MADE YEAH UH I'VE MADE SEVERAL NOTES JUST TO TEST IT
AND AND JUST PUT THE PEN IN INTO IT AND THEN IT CAME ONTO MY SCREEN AND IT LOOKED PERFECTLY
SO IT IT'S BETTER A BETTER DEVICE THAN UH
THAN THE SCREEN

AFTER A CAT A TURTLE AND A DOG
I THINK HE'S GONNA DRAW AN ELEPHANT
UH OH
NO
BETTER TO DRAW WITH A WITH
BUT WHAT IS HE UH
IS IT A RABBIT
DO YOU HAVE A RABBIT AT HOME
IS IT A WHITE RABBIT F IT'S THE WHITE RABBIT FROM THE MATRIX
OKAY THEN YEAH
OKAY
FINISHING TOUCH AND THEN WE'RE GOING FURTHER
YEAH
YEAH A LITTLE
WELL I THINK THE DOG IS THE THE MOST UH ARTISTIC
DON'T CHOOSE FOR YOUSELF
THAT'S SELFISH
OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA DIG INTO THE TO THE SERIOUS STUFF
UH THE SELLING PRICE FOR THE REMOTE WILL BE UH TWENTY FIVE EURO AND THE PRODUCTION COST UH MAY NOT BE MORE THAN UH TWENTY AND A HALF EURO
SO UH FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I DON'T THINK IT'S UH GONNA BE VERY UH VERY HIGH TECH HIGH DEFINITION
UH ULTRA MODERN UH KINDA REMOTE FOR TWELVE UH FIFT UH TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
UH THE PROFIT WE MUST MAKE WITH UH THE NEW REMOTE IS UH FIFTY MILLION
EURO
SO THAT'S A LOT
WE HAVE TO SELL UH A LOT OF UH
UH I THINK UH W WHEN THE SELLING PRICE IS TWENTY FIVE UH UH YOU GOT TWO MILLION TWO MILLION REMOTES
BUT OUR MARKETING RANGE IS UH MARKET RANGE IS INTERNATIONAL
SO WE HAVE UH VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE WORLD WE CAN SELL UH
WE CAN SELL OUR R REMOTES TO
AT LEAST THAT UH COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE UH A TELEVISION
UM
SO NOW IT'S TIME UH FOR US TO UH GOING UH TO DISCUSS A LITTLE UH THINGS
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT UH EXPERIENCE WITH A REMOTE CONTROL UH YOURSELF AT HOME
WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE UH A USEFUL UH NEW FEATURE
WHAT UH WHAT CAN DISTINGUISH OUR NEW TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL FROM ALL THE OTHERS
UM SO UH LET'S UH LET'S UH DISCUSS A LITTLE
I'M GONNA JOIN YOU AT THE TABLE
WELL WHAT WHAT'S THE MOST UH IMPORTANT THING AT A REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
SO NOT A NOT A REMOTE CONTROL WHO UH UH WHICH CAN UH CAN BE USED FOR TELEVISION AND A D. V. D. AND RADIO AND OR JUST ONLY
IF YOU HAVE THEM ON UH I CAN UH
OKAY
OH IN CASE YOU WANT IT
THIS IS A DEAD KIND OF FLY
BETWEEN THE THE THE YEAH THE THE UH
YEAH BE THE SCREENS
NO NO NO
ONLY ALL THE DRAWINGS GO THERE AT THE LEFT UH
OH THAT PEN DRAWINGS
UH NO I THINK UH WHEN IT IS UH IN WORD AND YOU HAVE SAVED IT IN THE SHARED DOCUMENTS FOLDER YOU CAN SHOW IT THERE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
FIVE MINUTES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
SO IT BE UH A MULTI PURPOSE UH VERY TECHNICALLY UH HIGH UH
REMOTE
YEAH IT MUST BE REALLY UH INNOVATIVE TECHNICAL WISE
YEAH
SO YEAH I I AGREE WITH YOU
SO WE MUST FOCUS ON THINGS WHO ARE REALLY UH REALLY ADD SOMETHING TO UH TO
YEAH
NO
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE THAT IT'S UH AT THE BEGINNING OF SUCH A PROJECT
IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY UH COOL TO TALK ABOUT WELL THIS WOULD BE COOL THAT WOULD BE COOL
UH BUT WE MUST NOT UH LOSE UH SIGHT OF THE THE USER UH UH FRIENDLY UH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE HIM
OKAY UH NEXT MEETING WILL START IN THIRTY MINUTES
SO UH YOU UH WILL HAVE UH INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS WHERE I PRESUME UH WILL BE SOME FEEDBACK UH VIA THE M THE MAIL
UM THE THE THE INDUSTRIAL UH DESIGNER HAS TO UH LOOK AT THE WORKING DESIGN
UH THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER HAS TO LOOK AT THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
SO THAT'S THE THING WE UH DISCUSSED
YEAH
OKAY
UM WHA
YEAH
YEAH
BUT MAYBE BECAUSE UH YOU ARE WORKING ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS YOU ARE WORKING ON THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
WE UH MUST UH HAVE A LITTLE OR KINDA UH UH UH HOW DO YOU CALL IT
UH
UH A LITTLE PLAN ON ON WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
SO YOU DON'T UH UH COME UP WITH THE USER REQUIREMENTS WHO DON'T FIT THE THE THE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS AT ALL
SOME BASIC THINGS WE CO WE WANT TO GOING TO DO
UH I THINK THAT'S WELL UH YEAH
WILL COME IN HANDY
OKAY
W HE SAYS
YEAH
WELL TH THAT'S THAT'S REALLY A STEP FURTHER
BUT IF YOU SAY UH IS IT UH UH ONE WAY OR MULTI PURPOSE THAT'S A
WHY
WHY
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
SO UH EACH INDIVIDUALLY I INDIVIDUALLY UH MUST THINK ON WHAT'S UH AT UH HIS POINT OF VIEW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
AND UH THEN WE'RE GOING TO FIT UH ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER THE NEXT MEETING
I MUST FINISH OFF NOW SO IT'S OVER
YOU UH WILL RECEIVE SPECIFIC SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS UH BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
AND I SEE YOU IN UH THIRTY MINUTES
THANK YOU
BE CAREFUL
HI
OH
GOOD MORNING
I'M JUERGEN TOFFS
I'M THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
ACH
OOPH
VERY ARTISTIC
OKAY
WOW
HE DOES HAVE BODY UH
HUH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE COLOUR AND THE PEN WIDTH DURING UH THE DRAWING
OR
YOU HAVE TO DRAW UH PUSH HARD ON THE PEN OR UH
OH
UH HMM
OKAY
OH
IT'S A VERY BLOODY CAT
IT'S A FROG
UH IT'S AN APPLE
A DOG
HUH
OH IT IS A TURTLE
IT'S UH INSIDE ITS SHELL
YOU'LL BE UH FINISHED SOONER
WOW
YES
OKAY
WHA THANK YOU
YEAH
UM
HOW DID IT WORK
PERFORMANCE
AND A PEN
UM
WELL VERY GOOD
I JUST UH THOUGHT I'D PICK THE EASIEST ONE
WELL WE HAD A DOG A FEW YEARS AGO
AND AND IT YEAH WHEN IT DIED WE DIDN'T GET A NEW ONE OR SOMETHING
BUT UH
UH A GRAPHICAL USER DESIGNER SO
HEY
OH
NO
CAN WORK TOGETHER
AH COLOUR
WELL IT'S OKAY
YEAH
UH OH
OH HE IS THE ARTISTIC DESIGN
REMOTE CONTROL ANIMAL
WELL WITH THE INTERFACE IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO HA TO DRAW HERE AND DISPLAY THERE UH
THAN ON THE WITH YEAH I M I MEAN LIKE UH LIKE ON HERE DRAWING DRAWING UH
AND THEN DISPLAYING ON SCREEN BUT
TOO EXPENSIVE YEAH
A GREEN RABBIT
THERE THE G WHITE GREEN RABBIT
HE'S A LITTLE BIT STONED THERE
YEAH HOW MUCH IS IT
HUNDRED MILLION UH REMOTES OR SOMETHING
OH YEAH
UM WELL I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF A REMOTE CONTROL IS THAT YOU CAN SWITCH CHANNELS
AND MY OPINION IS YOU SHOULD KEEP IT AS BASIC AS POSSIBLE
UH
IS IT POSSIBLE TO OPEN PEN DRAWINGS IN THIS UH ON THIS SCREEN
UH BUT UM WHICH THE ONES WE MADE ON THE
OH ONLY IN WORD OKAY
FOR WHAT PURPOSE
WE
AND AND THE PRICE
OKAY
AND HIM
YEAH
UM ONE THING UH WE MUST FIRST AGREE ON UH WHAT WE'RE GOING TO M GOING TO MAKE
DO WE ARE WE GOING TO USE UM IT IT FOR MULTIPLE SYSTEMS
OR UH WE SHOULD HAVE SOME AGREEMENT ON THAT BEFORE WE
OKAY
AH OKAY
CONSENSUS ON THE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
YEAH
WELL YEAH IF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED I I'VE GOTTA KNOW FOR WHAT KIND OF MACHINES THEY WILL BE
OR DO WE USE IT A TEXT SCREEN
OR UH WILL IT BE WITH UH WITH BLUETOOTH OR
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
SORRY
YES
YEAH
NO
COME UP
HI
MORNING
HI MY NAME'S UH
I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
BY THE WAY WHY WAS YOUR CAT UH RED
OH OKAY
OH YEAH SURE
NO IT'S A TURTLE
MUST BE A DOG
YEAH
UH
HMM
YEAH SURE
UH THANKS
I FIGURE I SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING MUCH MORE DIFFICULT
EXACTLY
UH
YES
NO
NO
YEAH EXACTLY
SO
UH I FIGURED THIS IS A PRETTY B GOOD IMPRESSION OF A RABBIT
UH UH
UH WELL
WHERE DOES THE PEN GO
JUST UH
UH I FIGURED THE RABBIT WAS ACTUALLY THE MOST UH IMPRESSIVE
OH SORRY
TWENTY MILLION
TWO MILLION OH YEAH TWO MILLION
YEAH
AND AND HIM
I FIGURE WE COULD GET BACK TO IT ON THE NEXT MEETING ACTUALLY
YEAH
YEAH ACTUALLY IT IS
THEN LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A F STEP FURTHER
YEAH WE CAN TAKE IT FROM THERE
YEAH I AGREE UH WE CAN TAKE IT FROM THERE
OR EDIT
OKAY CHEERS
GOOD MORNING
BY BIG BROTHER
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
OF OUR FACES
I'M UH TIM
UM MY FUNCTION IS THE MARKETING EXPERT
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
I HAVE A QUESTION
UM THIS EXERCISE UM DID THE COMPANY BOARD TELL YOU TO DO IT OR UH DID YOU JUST MAKE IT UP YOURSELF
IT'S PART OF THE INTRODUCTION OKAY
OKAY
UM YEAH
I DON'T KNOW REALLY HOW IT WORKS
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN SHOW US FIRST
YOU G YOU GET ELECTROCUTED OR
IT'S LIKE PICTIONARY
THE THE ONE WHO SAYS IT FIRST GETS A RAISE
IT'S A PORK
MM YEAH I HAVE IT AT HOME
WHAT'S IT CALLED
AH
MINIATURE SIZE
OKAY
OKAY
WE HAVE TO SPEED UP
REMEMBER YOU USE UH DIFFERENT COLOURS AND DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS
I OKAY
SAVE IT
YOU HAVE TO SAVE IT
I'VE DONE IT
NEW
'KAY
MM UH
NOT REALLY
UM
THAT ONE
YEAH
OKAY
OPEN
WHICH ONE IS IT
SMART BOARD
OKAY
AND NOW
OKAY
OKAY THANKS
'KAY I'VE SPEED UP
'KAY THAT'S FINE
LINE WIDTH
IT'S NOT AN APPLE
HMM
COLOUR
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
SMALLER
UM
'CAUSE I LIKED TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES
UH
NO IT'S UH
NO NO
IT'S COMING UP
MM
UH
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
OKAY YOU KNOW VERY ARTISTIC
YEAH
HERE YOU GO
UH THE BIG LINES WERE LIKE NINE
UH IT'S P
IT'S PRETTY GOOD UH
AN ARTIST
THINK YOU UH PICKED THE WRONG UH FUNCTION
WRONG JOB
WHA
THAT'S ENOUGH THANKS
I WONDER
I'M GONNA DESIGN A REMOTE UH REMOTE CONTROL ANIMAL
OH
SORRY
YEAH
THAT THAT MIGHT BE EASIER
BUT AT THE OTHER HAND UH A PEN LIKE THAT IS EASY TO HOLD IN YOUR HAND AND
I THINK IT'S EASIER TO DRAW
YEAH
WITH A PEN THAN WITH A MOUSE MOUSE
MOUTH
OH OKAY
YEAH
W WITH THIS PAPER IT'S TOO MU TOO EXPENSIVE
IT'S A RABBIT WITH UH BROKEN LEGS
YEAH
IT WILL DO
PROJECT MANAGER
UH
HAVE YOU BEEN UH COUNTING THE TIME
OKAY
LET'S GO ON THEN
IT'S PRETTY ABSTRACT
LIKE HOW MUCH
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK SO
UH BUT I HAVE SOME POINTS
CAN I SHOW THEM ON THE ON THE BIG SCREEN
MAYBE
YEAH
YEAH I CAN FIND UH
SCREEN
OKAY
OKAY I HAVE SOME UH POINTS FROM MARKETING POINT OF VIEW
UM JUST THE STANDARD THING LI THINGS LIKE UH INTUITIVE UH SMALL FAIRLY CHEAP
UH IT'S PRETTY CHEAP TWENTY FIVE EUROS
UH BRAND INDEPENDENT
UM I THINK IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MATTER UH WHICH BRAND YOUR T. V. OR OTHER THING IS
UM
FIVE MINUTES
OKAY I'LL WRAP IT UP QUICKLY
UM I PERSONALLY THINK IT HAS TO BE MULTI PURPOSE
UH MOST OF THE REMOTE C UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE UH JUST FOR ONE PURPOSE
AND UH BY MAKING IT MULTI PURPOSE IT UH HAS A NEW FEATURE ADDS A NEW FEATURE TO THE MARKET AND DISTINGUISH FROM UH FROM CURRENT PRODUCTS
UM MAYBE SOME OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAN INFRARED
UH I RATHER FIND IT VERY ANNOYING UM LIKE WHEN SOMEONE IS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE T. V. THEN YOU CAN'T SWITCH IT
UM THINK ABOUT UM SENDING IT OVER RADIO WAVES OR BLUETOOTH
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT UH EXPENSIVE
UM
AND SOMETHING LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN
UM UH LIKE I SAID HERE UM
MAYBE IT'S EASY
IT'S NICE AS AN ADDED FEATURE FEATURE THAT UM
WHEN YOU'RE ON A CERTAIN CHANNEL YOU CAN SEE ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN UH WHAT PROGRAMMES ARE COMING UP OR
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW YEAH
YEAH IT HAS TO BE UH
YEAH OUR COMPANY IS VERY UH
GOOD IN MAKING NEW INNOVATIVE UH THINGS
SO I I I I
TO THE CURRENT MARKET
LOOK YOU GOT SOME CHEAP UH REMOTE CONTROLS THERE
THEY JUST UH
YEAH YOU GOT A DOZEN OF 'EM
BUT WHEN YOU ENTER A NEW MARKET WITH A REMOTE CONTROL AND
UH WANNA GAIN MARKET SHARE
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL I THINK
YEAH
YEAH OF COURSE
BUT IT'S BUT BUT THIS IS JUST FROM MARKETING UH ASPECT
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT USER INTERFACE OR DESIGN
MM UH I I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO BE WE HAVE TO AGREE ON THAT
UH
I THINK TH THAT'S A PHA YEAH
THAT'S A PHASE FURTHER
JU JUST UH
MAKE SOME MOCK UPS SOME SOME GENERAL IDEAS
AND AND THEN WE CAN PLAN
YEAH
WE CAN PLAN FURTHER I THINK
MM YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU DECIDE
YOU'RE THE PROJECT MANAGER
UH THA THAT'S A SAME STEP FURTHER
YEAH
UH
YEAH
LIKE WE ALL HAVE A LIST OF UH THINGS THAT HAS TO B THAT HAVE TO BE IN IT OR HOW IT HAS TO BE LIKE
AND THEN IN THE NEXT MEETING WE DECIDE
W WHAT IT'S GONNA BE
A
AND THEN YOU S THEN YOU CAN DELETE UH
THE O THE OBSOLETE UH DETAILS
I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
DAMN
SUCCESS
HELLO
HI
YEAH
IT'S TOO BEAUTIFUL
A MINUTE PLEASE MY UH LAPTOP IS UH OH THERE IT IS THANK YOU
SO WELCOME BACK
AT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING UM
THE PLAN IS UH THAT UH EACH ONE OF YOU
SO NOT ME BUT ONLY YOU UH WILL UH PRESENT UH THE THE THINGS YOU WORKED ON UH THE LAST UH HALF HOUR
I WILL UH TAKE MINUTES AND WILL PUT UH THE MINUTES THAT I HAVE UH AT THE END OF THE SESSION IN THE SHARED FOLDER
ALSO THE MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS SESSION ARE ALSO IN THE SHARED FOLDER NOW SO YOU CAN READ THAT UH NOW OR AFTERWARDS
UM
UH I HAD AN EMAIL FROM THE FROM THE MANAGEMENT BOARD UH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU A AL ALSO UH RECEIVED IT
BUT THERE WERE FOUR POINTS UH WHICH UH I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT
FIRST ONE IS UH THEY THINK THAT UH TELETEXT TELETEXT BECOMES OUTDATED UH AND INTERNET WILL BE THE THE MAIN UH FOCUS
UH SECOND ONE IS ALSO IMPORTANT UH BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE DISCUSSION POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS SESSION
UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOU SHOULD ONL ONLY BE USED FOR THE TELEVISION
SO IT UH NOT GONNA IT'S NOT GONNA BE A MULTI PURPOSE REMOTE CONTROL SO UH THAT'S ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND
UH SECOND AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE MARKETING UH EXPERT
UH THE CURRENT UH CUSTOMERS UH ARE IN THE AGE GROUP GROUP OF UH FORTY YEARS AND OLDER
BUT WITH THIS UH NEW REMOTE UH THEY UH WILL UH WOULD LIKE TO REACH UH A GROUP UH YOUNGER THAN UH FORTY
UH AND UH I THINK TO KEEP IN MIND
BUT NOT REALLY UH FOR NOW IS THAT THEY UH WANT THE THE THE SLOGAN AND THE AND THE LOGO UH TO UH TO BE RECOGNISED MORE IN THE REMOTE
SO WE HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES SO I THINK UH NOT MORE THAN TEN MINUTES UH UH PER PRESENTATION UH EACH
AND PLEASE UH USE UH ALL THE THE THE FACILITIES SO THAT YOU HAVE EITHER SMARTBOARDS THE THE WORD FILES WHAT YOU UH WHATEVER YOU WANT
SO UH
TIM CAN YOU START
YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT IT'S STRANGE THAT THE THE MANAGE BOARD THE MANAGEMENT BOARD SAID THAT THE TELETEXT WILL BE UH OUTDATED BY THE INTERNET
SO THAT THAT'S STRANGE
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S A COOL IDEA
YEAH
THANK YOU TIM
JANUS CAN YOU UH
OKAY THANK YOU JANUS
YOU DO
THE LAST PRESENTATION
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TIM AND UH JANUS DON'T UH TALK TO TEN MINUTES SO UH TAKE YOUR TIME
IF YOU TAKE YOUR TIME TOO LONG I WILL UH EVENTUALLY UH
WARN YOU
UH YOU YOU JUST SAID UM UH YOU WANTED TO TO COMBINE MORE FUNCTIONS IN ONE SO UH YOU YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
BUT I THINK THAT IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT
THEN YOU CAN'T ESCAPE THE THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE BUTTONS UH WHICH GIVE S UH MORE OPTIONS THAN ONE
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
MM-HMM
SO YOU THINK IT'S WILL BE BETTER TO HAVE A T KINDA TOTAL TOUCH SCREEN
JIRUN
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
BUT LET'S NOT UH GO TOO WIDE ABOUT THE THOSE THINGS THAT'S THAT WHY WE'RE HERE
IT'S IT'S A NICE IDEA BUT I THINK THAT'S WE WEL LATER IN THE STAGE
I'VE ONE LITTLE QUESTION ABOUT UM A TOTAL TOUCH SCREEN OR UH UM A P YEAH A PARTIAL
UH BECAUSE I THINK UH ELDERLY PEOPLE MAY BE UH NOT USED TO UH A TOUCH SCREEN
SO THEY WANT THE THE THE NORMAL FUNCTIONS LIKE TELETEXT VOLUME CHANGING
UM UH TO BE UH YEAH KINDA TRADITIONALS UH AND UH THE THE THE THE OTHER FUNCTIONS
THE MORE DIFFICULT FUNCTIONS UH TO BE UH MAYBE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN BUT TO KEEP THIS AS UH NORMAL AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT ACCESSIBLE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT
YEP
MM-HMM
THEY LIKE THE FANCY STUFF YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH
OKAY AS YOU CAN SEE UH THE MINUTES FROM THE SECOND MEETING THIS ONE ARE UH ARE DONE
UH I'VE UH ADDED THE THIS UH FOUR THINGS FROM THE MANAGEMENT BOARD JUST TO KEEP IN MIND
UM EACH TIME I UH I HAD A SORT OF UH SUMMARY ON WHAT YOU TOLD AND UH WHAT YOU PERSONAL THINK
UH SO THAT CAN BE UH CAN BE READ OUT
UH A F A FEW THINGS I UH I NOTICED UH WERE UM
MOMENT
OOH
UH TH THE THE MAIN POINTS IN UH THIS UH UH IN THIS UH MEETING IS I THINK UH HOW UH IT'S GOING TO LOOK UH WITH UH WE MUST KEEP IT SIMPLE
BUT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UH HAVE MORE OPTIONS AND HAVE THEM UH HIDDEN OR SOMETHING
SO THEY DON'T UH YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG UH THING FULL OF UH BUTTONS OR UH UM AND UH THE POINT THAT UH YOU UH WANNA USE ONE UH CONTROLLER UH FOR UH UH HYPOTHETICALLY EACH TELEVISION
SO YOU MUST UH THE THE THE THE FUNCTIONS KNOW
LIKE THE MENUS OR THE THE PARENTAL CONTROL MUST BE ALL UH BY THE DONE BY THE REMOTE CONTROL AND NOT BY THE TELEVISION
I THINK THAT'S THE POINT WHAT UH
WE DISCUSSED
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE UH UH AN YEAH BUT YOU HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET RANGE SO YOU HAVE I THINK A BIG RANGE OF
YEAH
OKAY
AND IT'S NOT TOO COMPLEX TO DO IT
YEAH
JUST BUILD IT IN
YEP
OKAY
WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO GO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
N YEAH
IT'S VERY SENSITIVE
YEAH
OKAY WELL UH IT'S ALMOST AT THE END
SO WE HAVE NOW A LUNCH BREAK FINALLY YEAH
UH AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK UH IT'S BACK TO UH INDIVIDUAL WORK ONCE AGAIN UH THIRTY MINUTES
UH I WILL PUT MY MINUTES UH I HAVE UPDATED THEM SO UH S THEY'RE UPDATED IN THE SHARED FOLDER TOO
THIRTY MINUTES THE
FAILURE
UH UH THE SPECIFI UH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE NEXT UH MEETING YOU WILL ALL WILL RECEIVE UH AT THE UH THE THE EMAIL
I DON'T THINK I CAN UH SAY MUCH ABOUT IT
SO UH UH WAIT FOR YOUR EMAIL AND UH HOPEFULLY YOU GET IT DONE UH IN THE IN THE THIRTY MINUTES
AND I W WILL SEE YOU AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK AND THE THIRTY MINUTES
YEAH
UH WELL UH THIRTY MINUTES
UH YEAH
THIRTY MINUTES LUNCH BREAK YEAH
OH
FORTY FIVE
UH THEN WOULD IT BE UH ONE O'CLOCK
OR WE WE ASK OUR PERSONAL COACH
OKAY
THANK YOU
THANK YOU UH THAT WAS A VERY UH GOOD SESSION I THINK WE UH WE
UH YE WELL
YEAH BECAUSE UH ALL UH THINGS ARE UH STORED IN SMART BOARD DOT UH X. D. K. AND THAT'S IN
NO
WELL I CAN I CAN UH
YOU ALL UH HAVE THE THE QUESTIONNAIRE AGAIN ABOUT UH THE AFTER WORK
DESKT HUH
NO
PROJECT DOCUMENTS YEAH
OKAY THANK YOU
UH WELL IT'S IT'S SIMPLY FILLING OH NO IT'S UH IT'S ALSO FILLING OUT NO I'D DO IT AFTER LUNCH I THINK
I'M HUNGRY SO DO IT AFTER LUNCH
THANK YOU ALL
YOU'RE WELCOME
YEAH
WELL I BRING IT TO MY UH PERSONAL ROOM
MY EXECUTIVE UH BIG ROOM WITH THE WITH THE PANTING
HI
YEAH TRUE
MM
MM-HMM
OKAY
YES I CAN GO AHEAD
LAST PRESENTATION
OKAY
WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE A PRESENTATION ABUT SOME OF THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS OF THESE DESIGN AND UH USABILITY FUNCTIONS
UM WHAT'S MY OPINION ABOUT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO COMBINE THE DESIGN
TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES AND THE USER FRIENDLINESS IN ONE SO IF YOU UM GOING TO DESIGN A REMOTE THAT LOOKS GOOD
THAT SHOULDN'T WEIGH OVER THE UH IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE OF COURSE BUT ALSO THE USER FRIENDLINESS SO THA THAT'S THAT'S SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS
AND ANOTHER ONE IS UM THE USE UM OF MANY FUNCTIONS WILL WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
SO USE AS AS LITTLE FUNCTIONS AS POSSIBLE OR AT LEAST DON'T DISPLAY THEM ALL AT ONCE ON THE SAME REMOTE
IF YOU HAVE FIFTY FUNCTIONS YOU DON'T WANT FIFTY BUTTONS UH T UH TO BE SHOWN AT THE SAME TIME
'CAUSE WHEN YOU VISIT AN INTERNET UH SITE YOU DON'T WANT FIFTY LINKS UH TO SEE BUT MAYBE USE A HIERARCH HIERARCHY UH STRUCTURE
AND UH WELL ONE OF THE IDEAS WAS MAYBE UH USE TOUCH SCREEN BUT S I DON'T KNOW IN HOW FAR THAT IS POSSIBLE
SINCE WE ARE STICKING TO UH UM INFRARED AND AND THE REMOTE CANNOT RECEIVE ANYTHING BUT UH WE MIGHT UH CONSIDER THAT
UM WELL OF COURSE I I HOPE THIS IS ALL CLEAR TO YOU
IF YOU YOU CAN USE REMOTE LIKE THIS WITH ALL THE FUNCTIONS
MANY FUNCTIONS BUT WELL YOUR THUMB IS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN TH IT THAN THIS
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT YOU PUSH
AND UM IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TELETEXT YOU'LL BE UH SEARCHING FOR HALF AN HOUR FROM UH UM YEAH WELL WHERE IS IT
WHERE THE HELL HE HERE I GUESS AND YEAH WHEN YOU HAVE TO UH USE SOMETHING ELSE
SO JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE MAKE CLEAR BUTTONS EASY TO USE
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO USE A PLAY AND BACK AND STOP
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
UM WELL THIS WAS BECAUSE OF OUR LAST DISCUSSION IF MULTIPLE MACHINES ARE USED CREATE EASY SWITCH BETWEEN THE MACHINES BUT UM IT'S NO LONGER UH APPLYING
WELL YEAH I PREFER TO USE IT ONLY FOR T. V.
AND UM
N UH NOT TO GIVE TOO MANY OPTIONS AND AND IF POSSIBLE UH THE BUTTONS SHOULD GIVE A DR DIRECT ACTION NOT FIRST SELECT
YEAH AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFICULTIES LIE
YEAH THIS SO THAT'S THE THING YOU HAVE TO WEIGH AGAINST EACH OTHER
DO WE WANT TO USE A FEW OPTIONS AND MIGHT NOT BE SO OR ORIGINAL
OR UH MULTI PURPOSE AS WE THOUGHT OR DO WE WANT TO USE UM MANY BUTTONS
SO UM WEIGHING THOSE FACTORS
THE DOESN'T
YEAH
YEAH BUT WHEN ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAD DO WE WANT TO USE UH A MENU DISPLAY ON THE T. V.
OR UM DOES HAVE TO F EVERYTHING UH BE IN REMOTES
'CAUSE IF YOU USE A MEMORY DISPLAY ON THE T. V.
YOU CAN SIMPLY PUSH UH A MORE MENU AND THEN SELECT THE OPTIONS YOU WANT TO HAVE AND PRESS OKAY
UH SO THAT'S MY RECOMMENDATION IF YOU USE MANY OPTIONS IN ONE BUTTLE BUTTON
UM DISPLAY THE MENU ON THE T. V. AND DON'T UM USE COMBINATION OF T OF TWO BUTTONS AT THE SAME TIME OR PRESSING BUTTONS THREE TIMES FOR FIVE SECONDS
IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR MOST USERS
YEAH THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM
YES
SO IF WE HAVE TO STICK WITH CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES AND UH
UM
WELL YEAH THE RESTRICTIONS OF WHAT'S UH IS ON THE MARKET TODAY UM YOU SHOULD KEEP IT S AT THIS
USE BIG CLEAR BUTTONS
NOT TOO MANY
SO MAYBE WE'LL LOOSE A FEW OPTION UH OPTIONS BUT I THINK I THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT
UM
ESPECIALLY THE IMPORTANT BUTTONS UM IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH CHANNEL CHANGE YOUR VOLUME UH USE TELETEXT
IT UH IT HAS TO WORK AT ONCE AND MORE ADVANCED OPTIONS MAY BE PUT IT S SOMEWHERE AWAY ON THE REMOTE
BEHIND UH A LITTLE UH LITTLE THING OR A TOUCH SCREEN
AND YEAH IF YOU WANT TO UH UH S PUT ON STAND BY OR CHANGE THE CHANNEL THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE TO DO
NOT FIRST CHANGE MENU OPTIONS OR SWITCH SOMETHING
UM WELL YEAH AS YOU ALREADY TOLD GIVE SOME FEEDBACK
IF THE USER IS PUSHING A BUTTON HE SHOULD KNOW IF THE TELEVISION OR N AT LEAST REMOTE IS REACTING AND NOT JUST THAT THE BATTERIES MAY BE LOW
AND UM WELL MY CONCLUSION IS UH IS UH LESS IS MORE KEEP IT SIMPLE
SO UH MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST EASE DOWN ON THE FUNCTIONALITY TO UH TO KEEP IT ACCESSIBLE ON T BECAUSE YOU ALL KNOW
IF THERE ARE A LOT OF FUNCTION ON THE THE TELEVISION SOME YOU YOU'LL NEVER KNOW UH AND NEVER USE
AND THEREFORE IT'S UH IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE VOLUME OR CHANNEL THAT IS ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE AND EASY AND OTHER FUNCTIONS UM THAT ARE NOT SO IMPORTANT UM WELL YOU WE SHOULD CONSIDER JUST NOT USING THEM OR AT LEAST PUTTING THEM SOMEWHERE ON THE REMOTE WHERE THEY'RE NOT IN THE WAY FOR THE FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
MAYBE THAT'S AN OPTION
UM KEEP THE PRIMARY BUTTONS VISIBLE
UH MAKE A REMOTE THAT FITS EASILY IN THE HANDS AND FOR SOME DESIGN ISSUES UH WELL
PUT A LOGO ON IT AND MAYBE USE IT UH IN SOME AESTHETIC UH AESTHETIC FORM
BUT UH TH THE IMPORTANT BUTTONS M MAKE THEM ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE AND PUSHABLE AND CLEAR AND MAYBE USE A TOUCH SCREEN
OR IF THAT'S UH WILL BECOME TOO DIFFICULT JUST UH
LIKE TELEVI SOME O OLDER TELEPHONES USE A L UH MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE TO TO FLIP THEM OPEN AND UH JUST EXPAND THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT ARE NORMALLY VISIBLE
UM
YEAH
THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS YOU UH YOU JUST SEE A MENU FROM SYSTEM FUNCTIONS OR TELETEXT FUNCTIONS
AND YOU JUST CHOOSE ONE AND THEN ALL ALL THE OPTIONS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE AND YOU JUST C S YEAH T SCROLL THROUGH THEM
WELL UM THEN I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PROPOSAL
IF YOU MAKE ONE BIG TOUCH SCREEN
USE THE SAME CONCEPT AS HERE KEEP THE BUTTONS ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND USE THE LOWER PART OF THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE REST
YEAH
YES
OKAY
OKAY I AGREE BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY ALWAYS UM MAKE THE SAME BUTTONS ACCESSIBLE
SO USE JUST FOR SPECIAL OPTIONS A PART OF THE TOUCH SCREEN
AND SO UM AN ELDER DESIGNER PICKS UP TH THE OF AN ELDER PARENTS OR GRANDPARENT PICKS UP THE REMOTE FROM THE LITTLE CHILD AND WHO'S ALL IN THE SYSTEMS FUNCTIONS
YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO TURN OFF THE T. V. OR TO SWITCH THE CHANNEL WITHOUT UM WELL USING ALL THE MENU STRUCTURES TO GET BACK TO THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH WH
IS THAT POSSIBLE TO USE OR NO
WELL YEAH WELL DOES IT HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE TELEVISION
WELL I THINK THAT HE MEANS THAT UM MAYBE BY SOME OPTION UH MAKE SURE THAT UM REMOTE CONTROL AND THE T. V. MATCH
AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU CAN UM USE SOME S INSERT SOME PASSWORDS AS BEING APPARENT THAT THE CHILDREN CANNOT USE THIS UH CHANGE THE SETTINGS OF THE T. V.
LIKE COLOUR AND THEN VOLUME AND UH
MM-HMM
OH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL B BUT MAKE IT A SEPARATE OPTION IN THE MENU SO THAT IT'S IT'S DIF DIS DISPLAYED FROM UH DISPLAYED HERE SO UH PARENTS UH
YEAH YOU CAN DE DISPLAY IT ON THE ON THE OLD STYLE
YOU CAN DISPLAY ACTUAL BUTTONS ON THE TOUCH SCREENS
YEAH OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES
WELL YOU CAN USE UM WHEN YOU UH HOW DO YOU CALL IT S UM SYNCHRONIZED THE UM REMOTE AND THE T. V. THEN THERE'S ALWAYS
THERE ARE ALWAYS UH POSSIBILITIES TO CHANGE THE COLOUR AND THE BRIGHTNESS AND THE VOLUME AND UM WELL MAYBE WE CAN LOOK OUT IF THERE'S OPTIONS THAT THE REMOTE UM IN ITS MEMORY CAN SEE WHAT KINDA T. V. IT IS
FROM AH IT'S A PHILIPS THIS AND THIS AND THAT AND THEN GIVE THE OPTIONS THAT ARE CAPABLE THE CAPABLE FROM THE T
WELL THERE ARE UNIVERSAL D UM UM REMOTES AND THEY ALL HAVE A FUNCTIONALITY FOR ALL THE T. V. S
UH SO THIS WOULDN'T BE A EXTRA FEATURE TO INCORPORATE THE MEN MENUS OF THESE
YEAH
YEAH
WELL
YEAH
MM-HMM
OH UM MO NO YOU CAN JUST SAY UH THE C
YEAH
IN CODES Y YOU YOU GET A B A BOOK WITH CODES
YOU LOOK UP
I HAVE A PHILIPS H. FIFTY FIVE AND IT SAYS PRESS CODE FOUR FIVE FIVE AND YOU PRESS CODE FOUR FIVE FIVE ON THE UH IN THE REMOTE AND IT DISPLAYS ALL YOUR UH MENU OPTIONS
MEMORY IN THE IN THE REMOTE
YEAH WELL UM IF YOU LOOK AT THE UM MANUALS FROM UNIVERSAL UH REMOTES THERE ARE MAYBE UM THREE FOUR HUNDREDS T. V. S AT MAXIMUM
IF YOU HAVE ALL OF THEM ALL THE OLD AND NEW T. V. S SUMMED UP SO UH I THINK UH IT IS POSSIBLE
YEAH
WELL THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY A NEW ONE IT'S VERY GOOD FOR MARKETING
MAYBE OR AN UPDATE SOFTWARE UPDATE
FIRMWARE UPDATE YOU SAY
YEAH
WELL AT UH YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE SHOP AND UH THEY
YEAH SER O AND THEY CAN DOWNLOAD IT FOR YOU
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL ALREADY DIGITAL INFORMATION IS SENT T TO THE THE STANDARDS T. V. UH CONNECTIONS
YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S UH PROGRAMME IS ON ON THE NEW UH CHANNELS SO MAYBE J THEY WE CAN SEND THAT INFORMATION ALONG WITH STANDARD T. V. UH
RECEIVING
OH YEAH
YEAH
DIFFICULT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH UH S I THINK SOME I THINK IT'S GOOD IDEA YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY LET'S UH SAVE THIS IN THE MEANWHILE UH
UM M FOR WHICH ONE ARE WE GOING
MY MISTAKE
THAT ONE OR UH
YOUR VOTE AND YOUR OKAY
WELL I WAS UH DOUBTING ABOUT WHICH ONE TO TAKE
BUT UH YOU'VE CONVINCED ME THAT UH IF YOU DI DISPLAY BUTTONS ABOUT THE SAME AS THEY WOULD LOOK ON A NORMAL UM REMOTE ALL ELDERLY PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO
OPENS UP IS TOO DIFFICULT OR UH
BREAK IT I DON'T GET
OH SO YEAH
YEAH
A QUARTER TO ONE MAYBE
OKAY
YEAH IS IT POSSIBLE TO STORE THIS ON THE SHARE DOCUMENTS OR WHAT
'KAY SAVE IT AS AN IMAGE ON THE RES
NO AND USE AN IMAGE IF POSSIBLE
J. PEG
J. PEG
YEAH IT'S BETTER
YEAH
OH YEAH IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE
TO OUR P. C. S
IT'S CONNECTED
YEAH
IT GIVES THE NA OH
YES
THE QUESTIONNAIRE FILL IN UH WE FILL OUT D AFTER LUNCH OR UH
OKAY
YES
WE CAN LEAVE THE P. C. ON I THINK YEAH AND RETURN TO THE
YEAH BRING TO I GOTTA BRING IT HOME
A BIG OFFICE
YES
HI
I SEE MY BUNNY IS STILL STANDING
NO ONE DRAWING IT
UH I FIGURED UH THAT MUCH
WHEN YOU MENTIONED UH IMPROVING FUNCTIONS WHAT UH WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU THINK ABOUT
UH THE FUNTIONABILITY
AH OKAY SO FOCUSING MORE ON THE USED BUTTONS
YEAH
COULD YOU USE PERHAPS UH ONE BUTTON FOR MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS LIKE EXAMPLE PRESSING IT IN LONGER MAKES IT SWITCH TO AN DIFFERENT FUNCTION FOR EXAMPLE
THANK YOU
YEAH MA PERHAPS JUST JUST AN IDEA
YEAH
UH YEAH YEAH I'LL GO SURE
RIGHT UH I'LL BE UH EXPLAINING A BIT ABOUT UH WORKING DESIGN ABOUT UH THE PROJECT
WELL UH WHAT I DID WAS I DISSECTED UH UH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS AND UM I VIEWED HOW HOW THEY W LOOKED
HOW THEY WORKED UH WHAT KIND OF COMPONENTS ARE INVOLVED AND HOW THEY ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER
AND UH AFTER THAT I PUT UP A SCHEME ABOUT HOW UH THESE THINGS ARE ORGANISED AND I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU IN IN A IN A FEW SECONDS
AND I'LL EXPLAIN A BIT ABOUT UH HOW IT WORKS AND HOW WE COULD UH BUILD ONE AND WHY I THINK SEVERAL POSSIBILITIES UH THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE EARLIER MEETING FALLS OFF
UM RIGHT
UH WELL WHAT I DID WAS UH I I CHECKED UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND THE UH REMOTE CONTROLS OF TODAY ARE ALL INFRARED NOT LIKE ALL PROBABLY KNOW
AND THE THING ABOUT THAT IS UM THE REMOTE CONTROLS UH HAVE TO ACT AS A T. V. OR UH A STEREO OR SOMETHING
AND THOSE UH HAVE A TRANSMITTER THAT'S ALSO FOCUSED ON INFRARED
SO IF WE WANT TO UH BUILD UH MM A REMOTE CONTROL UH WITH BLUETOOTH FOR INSTANCE THEN UH THE T. V. SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH TOO IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE
SO THAT WOULD MEAN EXTRA COST FOR THE USER AND THUS UH THAT'S THAT WOULDN'T MEAN A A CHEAP UH REMOTE CONTROL FOR US
SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHY MOST CONTROLS ARE STILL INFRARED
FURTHERMORE THEY ALL HAVE UH A A VERY SIMPLE STRUCTURE
SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY UH MEAN LOWER COSTS AND UH I THAT COULD MEAN FOR US A GOOD THING UH 'CAUSE UH WELL WE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD A RELATIVELY CHEAP UH A CHEAP UH REMOTE
WELL UH AS I MENTIONED READY WE HAVE SOME BLUETOOTH WELL IT MAY BE POSSIBLE BUT UH I FIGURED IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE IN WITHIN OUR BUDGET
BUT THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE BUT THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING FOR MARKETING TO LOOK INTO
F BECAUSE UH WELL MY PERSONAL OPINION IS UH IS NOT TO DO UH BLUETOOTH OR OR RADIO WAVES ALTHOUGH
YEAH ACTUALLY I HAVE T
YEAH
YEAH I ACTUALLY I FIGURED THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE RATHER NICE BUT THEN YOU'D STILL HAVE THE UH THE INFRARED FUNCTION
SO IN IN THEORY YOU'D ACTUALLY JUST MOVE THE PROBLEM
BUT UH WHAT I DID UH THINK ABOUT WAS WHEN YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE UH THE CUP HOLDER
IS WHY NOT UH INTRODUCE A SPEECH FUNCTION LIKE WHERE IS THE REMOTE
IF SOMEBODY SAYS WHERE IS THE REMOTE THEN IT GOES UH BEEP UH BEEP BEEP BEEP OR SOMETHING I DUNNO
MAYBE UH MAYBE SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO I DUNNO UH WHAT THE COST THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE
BUT IT MAY BE UH MAY BE SOMETHING TO EXPLORE
UH I'LL I'LL JUST EXPLAIN A BIT OF THE COMPONENTS
UH FIRST YOU HAVE THE ENERGY SOURCE
THE ENERGY SOURCE WOULD BE A BATTERY SIMPLE UH BATTERY UH THAT YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE
I FIGURED THAT WOULD BE BEST 'CAUSE WHEN THE BATTERY UH STOPS FUNCTIONING UH WE COULD JUST UH USE YOU COULD JUST GO OUT AND BUY A NEW ONE
SO WE DIDN'T AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL UH TO BE TOO COMPLICATED ABOUT THAT
UH THE ENERGY SOURCE IS CONNECTED TO THE INFRARED BUTTON
BUT UH THE INFRARED BUTTON UH WORKS ONLY VIA THE CHIP AND THE SUBCOMPONENT TO UH THE SWITCH THERE IS A SWITCH UH BETWEEN THESE
WHEN THE SWITCH IS PRESSED IN A W ON THIS THIS CASE IT SWITCHES A BUTTON
WHEN A BUTTON IS PRUSH PUSHED IN UH A ELECTRIC CURRENT GOES THROUGH HERE
AND IN UH IMMEDIATELY A L A BULB LIGHTS UP UH DISPLAYING TO THE USER THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
THAT'S UH THAT'S SO THE H USER WON'T BE UM THINKING WELL UH DID THE BUTTON BE PRESSED W WHAT HAPPENED UH
OR I PRESS BUTTON BUT NOTHING'S HAPPENING ON THE T. V. SO IS IS SOMETHING WRONG OR SOMETHING
SO THAT'S JUST TO UH TO TO EXPLAIN THE OF TO TO UH MAKE IT CLEARER TO THE USER
UH W WELL THE SIGNAL GOES VIA CHIP THAT'S TRANSLATED INTO UH ELECTRIC SIG UH ELECTRONIC SIGNALS AND THEN IT'S PROCESSED AND THEN IT'S SENT TO THE INFRARED BULB WHERE IT WILL BE UH UH RECEIVED ON THE RECEIVING END
AND THOSE UH INTERPRETED BY THE DEVICE WELL IN THIS CASE THE TELEVISION
UH WELL MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES HERE WELL WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
NOT TOO MANY UH GADGETS AND FUNCTIONS
JUST LIKE YOU SAID UH WELL THE MOST USERS N UH YOU HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS AND YOU U U USE YOU DON'T USE THEM
SO WHY WHY SHOULD WE INVENT UH W SPEND MORE TIME ON THOSE
UH I I THINK WE SHOULD STICK BY WITH INFRARED TRANSMITTING AND UH NO RECEIVING
SO UH NO INPUT FROM THE TELEVISION
SO I THINK WE SHOULDN'T BE UH SPENDING TIME ON UM TELETEXT AND ST THINGS LIKE THAT
BECAUSE WHEN YOU UH WANT TELETEXT ON UH INFRARED YOU'D HAVE TO BUILD IN A RECEIVER TOO
AND SO IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE SIGNALS FROM UH WHAT'S ON T. V. AND SUCH
SO I FIGURE THAT WOULD BE UH SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY AND TIME AND
YES BUT WHAT SHOULD WE UH S I I I F I AGREE WITH YOU
BUT SHOULD WE SPEND MONEY OR AND TIME ON BUILDING A RECEIVER INTO THE UH REMOTE CONTROL
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE I MEAN EXTRA COMPONENTS EXTRA DESIGNS UM LARGER G UH REMOTE CONTROL
THESE ALL UH ALL STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT
SO I I MY PERSONAL OPINION IS NO NO NO RECEIVER AT ALL
UM WELL WE SHOULD UH LOOK INTO THE DESIGN AND THE FUNCTIONABILITY
LIKE I SAID UH USE ONE BUTTON FOR INSTANCE FOR M MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS
OR WELL UH JUST HIDE THE FEW BUTTONS O OF SWITCHING IT OPEN OR SOMETHING THE USUAL UH STUFF
AND UH DON'T OVERBUILD WE SHOULDN'T MAKE A BIG UH REMOTE CONTROL FOR SIMPLE FUNCTIONS BUT WE WE SHOULD STICK TO THE BASICS
SO THAT WAS MY UH MY PERSONAL OPINION
AND THAT WAS MY UH MY PRESENTATION UH
YEAH BUT
YEAH
YEAH BUT
YEAH BUT
WELL YOU D YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT UH SEVERAL T. V. S UH DON'T EVEN HAVE A MENU STRUCTURE OR THEY HAVE A VERY SIMPLE MENU STRUCTURE
SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT NOT ALL UH D NOT OUR REMOTE WON'T BE ABLE TO WORK ON ALL TELEVISIONS
AND THAT WOULD BE UH A CONSIDERABLE PROBLEM
YEAH
NOT EMBED
YEAH BUT THEN WITH SOMETHING LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN COULD COULD MAKE MORE MENU UP POP UP OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH
THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS
YEAH
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO MAKE JUST ONE BIG TOUCH SCREEN
UH ONE ONE SMALL UH TOUCH SCREEN UH APPLET AND UH I'LL JUST MAKE UM UH LET'S SAY FIFTEEN BUTTONS ON IT
AND UH WE HAVE THREE OF THOSE UH ACTUALLY JUST UH MENUS WITH SUB MENUS WITH OR SUB ITEMS SUB FUNCTIONS
YES
YEAH
YEAH YEAH LIKE LIKE THE IPOD IDEA THAT THAT WE JUST SAW
YOU JUST HAVE A F A FEW SELECTED BUTTONS AND UH A FEW MENUS
AND WITH THIS IDEA YOU COULD ACTUALLY MAKE UH SEVERAL YOU CAN ALSO IMPROVE UH LATER ON
UH UH I THINK THAT WILL BE GREAT
YEAH I WOU I WOULD ACTUALLY GO FOR THE
YEAH
THAT IS POSSIBLE THAT WELL THAT ACTUALLY DEPENDS ON THE TELEVISION BUT I THINK I FIGURE THAT WOULD BE
WELL Y YOU S YOU SEE THE FI UH THING IS WHEN YOU BUY A REMOTE YOU YOU SET THE UH CHANNELS
THE THE CHANNELS ARE DIFFERENT ON EACH TE TELEVISION THEY AREN'T SET IN A PRESET ORDER
SO UH IF YOU UH LOCK ON A REMOTE UH LET'S SAY CHANNEL FIFTEEN
WELL CHANNEL FIFTEEN ON THIS TELEVISION IS DIFFERENT THAN CHANNEL FIFTEEN ON THE OTHER TELEVISION SO THAT WOULD BE UH THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY THE MAIN CONCERN
YES
YES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT WOULD B
YEAH THAT
UH
I I DO
UH I DO AGREE BECAUSE WELL IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME WHEN YOU TOUCH A TOUCH SCREEN OR WHEN YOU TOUCH A BUTTON
BUT WELL WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S OUR TARGET UH AUDIENCE
W WE ARE AIMING FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE AND THEY THEY CHOSE
SO THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY UH A
BUT THEY
WELL THEY UH THEY ALL HAVE TO BE PROGRAMMED TO FIT YOUR T. V. AND THAT THAT IS BIT OF A TRICKY JOB
I ACTUALLY USE ONE OF THOSE WHEN THEY ARE THEY ARE KINDA KINDA TROUBLESOME
BUT BUT THE THING IS WHE WHEN YOU UH START UH BUILDING SOMETHING LIKE THIS YOU HAVE TO BUILD A RECEIVER INTO THE UH T INTO THE REMOTES
BECAUSE UH IN ORDER FOR THE REMOTE TO PROCESS SOMETHING FROM THE T. V. LIKE UH TO SYNCHRONISE AND YOU HAVE TO SEND AND RECEIVE AND THAT'S WELL
YEAH
YES
YEAH
OH OKAY YEAH SURE UH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
OH YEAH YEAH SURE THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE YEAH
PROFILES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
YEAH SURE
NO THAT WOULDN'T BE UH
YEAH A FEW VARIABLES
YEAH
AH IT IS
IT IS DEFINITELY PO
YEAH FIRMWARE UPGRADE
THAT'S MAYBE THE CUP HOLDER
YEAH
WELL NOT EVERYBODY HAS UH HAS UH A P. C. AT HOME
WELL THE MOST MOST PEOPLE HAVE BUT NOT NOT EVERYBODY AND
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE SERVICE CEN OR YOU COULD WELL YOU COULD S ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PLACE HOLDER YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER
AND YOU COULD PROBABLY UH MAKE A CONNECTION TO UH AN TELEPHONE LINE OR A INTERNET CONNECTION
YEAH
WELL THEN THEN IT'S BE UH BACK TO THE BUILDING A RECEIVING UH WELL UH IF IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH IT TO BUILD IT IN
WE COULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT INTO IT BUT I DUNNO IT IT WOULD BE UH BRINGING MORE COSTS UH WITH WITH IT AND
YEAH THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY BEST YEAH
LIKE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BUY A T. V. YOU JUST ASK WELL I'LL
YEAH
YEAH THAT WOULD BE BEST YEAH
NO NO
EXACTLY SO
YEAH MY VOTE GOES OUT TO THE RIGHT
FLIPS OPEN
EXPORT
MAYBE NOT EXPORT FUNCTION
G. YEAH J. PEG
N OH
TO ROOM
I'LL JUST UH SAVED IN MY DOCUMENTS
YEAH IN MY OWN UH IN MY OWN MESSENGER
YEAH
OKAY NICE
AYE CHEERS
HEY GUYS
TOO WICKED
OKAY
'KAY WELCOME
I HAVE SOME UH NEW FINDINGS ON UH MARKETING EXPERT LEVEL
WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU
THE METHOD I USED WAS UM GIVING ORDERS TO OUR USABILITY LAB UH TO DO A QUESTIONNAIRE
UM ONE HUNDRED RESPONDENTS WERE INVOLVED
AND MY MARKETING UH DEPARTMENT GENERATED A REPORT WITH A LOT OF RESULTS
UM
THESE WERE A COUPLE OF FINDINGS FIRST PAGE OF THREE
UM
WE HAVE THREE AUDIENCES OF TWO AUDIENCES I'M SORRY
UH THE FIRST ONE THIS SCALE FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE AGE
UH THE SECOND ONE IS FROM SIXTY FOUR UH FORTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE
UM AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THE MARKET SHARE FOR THE FIRST AUDIENCE IS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT UM SIXTY FIVE
UH SECOND AUDIENCE AUDIENCE IS UH THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
MM AND SOME INTERESTS FROM THE FROM THE AGE GROUPS
UH IT SEEMS LIKE THE YOUNG USERS OF REMOTE CONTROLS REALLY LIKE THE FANCY UH NEW TECHNOLOGY STUFF LIKE UH AN L. C. D. SCREEN ON THE REMOTE CONTROL UM
SPEECH RECOGNITION
I DON'T THINK THAT'S UH REALLY APPROPRIATE
UM AND WHEN YOU SEE UH THE AUDIENCE
THE AGE IS GOING UP UH
YEAH THEY DON'T REALLY WANT IT ANYMORE AT LEAST THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES
SECOND FINDINGS OUT OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE UM ARE THE OPINION
THE OPINIONS UH OF THE AUDIENCE ABOUT CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
FIRST POINT IS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS FIND THE MOST REPO REMOTE CONTROLS VERY UGLY
UH AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE USERS WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY
SO THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING FOR THE USER INTERFACE UH DESIGNER
OKAY THIRD FINDINGS
ACCORDING TO THE FREQUENCY OF USE VERSUS IMPORTANCE INVESTIGATION UM FOLLOWING BUTTONS ARE MOST IMPORTANT
UM I WILL TELL SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THIS UH THIS TEST WAS YEAH DONE
UM PERSONS WERE ASKED
UH WHAT THE BUTTONS WERE UH THEY USE MOST HOW MUCH AN HOUR AND UH IN THE SECOND TABLE THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE BUTTONS
UM WHEN YOU MULTIPLY THEM YOU GET THE THESE THREE POINTS
SWITCHING CHANNELS UM YEAH
THAT'S PRETTY UH
PRETTY NORMAL THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH A REMOTE CONTROL
UM THE SECOND TELETEXT UH AND THE THIRD UH VOLUME CONTROLS
UM I THINK IT'S GOOD UH THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE USER WANT WANTS UH AT LEAST THE THESE THREE POINTS HAVE TO BE UH VERY CLEAR
YEAH OKAY
YEAH OKAY BUT UH AT THE MOMENT UH TELETEXT IS
YEAH TH THE BEST THING YOU CAN GET UH ON T. V. LIKE GETTING INFORMATION
SO UH WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE WHAT DO THEY USE
THEY USE TELETEXT AND NOT THE INTERNET ON A REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S RIDICULOUS
THAT'S A NE I IT IT'S A NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S NOT INCORPORATED RIGHT NOW
OKAY MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
UM
I THINK WE SHOULD AIM AT THE UH AUDIENCE FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE
MM FIRST OF ALL UM IT'S THE BIGGEST SHARE THE BIGGEST AUDIENCE SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
UH SECOND I THINK YOU WILL GET THE MOST REVENUE FROM I FROM IT
UM
YEAH PEOPLE FROM SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE WATCH A LOT OF T. V. MORE THAN UH PEOPLE WHO ARE EL UH ELDER
UM SECOND POINT WE HAVE TO IMPRO IMPROVE THE MOST USED FUNCTIONS AS I SAID HERE SWITCHING CHANNELS TELETEXT AND VOLUME CONTROLS
THIRD POINT UM THAT CAME OUT OF THE UH OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE UH PEOPLE USED TO UH
GET LOST OFF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER SO MAYBE IT'S AN IDEA FOR US UH TO DESIGN EX KIND OF PLACEHOLDER UH ON SIDE OF THE
YEAH OF THE T. V. WHERE YOU CAN PUT THE THE REMOTE CONTROL IN
UM
THAT'S ABOUT IT I THINK
YEAH
UH NOT NOT THE R NOT THE FUNCTIONS BUT UH IT CAME OUT THAT A LOT OF BUTTONS WEREN'T EVEN USED UH ON A REMOTE CONTROL
SO YOU CAN HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL FULL OF BUTTONS A HUNDREDS HUNDREDS OF BUTTONS BUT IF YOU DON'T USE THEM YEAH IT'S
YEAH THEY HAVE TO BE ON IT J JUST TO T TO GET IT DONE IF NECESSARY
BUT UM THE MOST USED BUTTONS UH HAVE TO BE BIGGER OR
YEAH PERHAPS
JUST FOR THE MINOR FUNCTIONS PERHAPS
JUST TO GET LESS BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL TO MAKE IT EASIER AND QUICKER TO LEARN
YEAH
'KAY THAT'S IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UH INCORPORATING BLUETOOTH OR A RADIO UH RECEIVER UH IN THE PLACE HOLDER NEXT TO THE T. V. CONNECTED TO THE T. V.
SO IT'S IN THE WRONG PRODUCT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
YEAH MAYBE ANOTHER PROBLEM UH
I THINK CURRENT T. V. S CAN EVEN SEND INFRARED
HUH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
HMM
HMM IT'S MAYBE AN OPTION UH IF YOU USE AN L. C. D. OR A TOUCH SCREEN UM
THAT IN THE MIDDLE ARE THE THE MAIN KEYS LIKE DISPLAYED ON THE
UH YEAH
YEAH THIS
NO
YEAH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OKAY JUST UH IN THE MIDDLE THE GENERAL FUNCTIONS LIKE PLAY UH
CHANNEL SWITCHING AND THEN UH AT THE TOP OR AT THE BOTTOM SOME MENUS LIKE UH SETTINGS OR THAT YOU CAN DROP DOWN
MM
NAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK SO TOO BUT AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE UM UH A LOT OF T. V. S HAVE DIFFERENT MENUS
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR MENU UH AT YOUR DEVICE UH IT COULD BE THAT DON'T CORRESPOND TO THE MENU WHAT'S ACTUALLY ON T. V.
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH I THINK THE IDEA UH ABOUT UH TOUCH SCREEN
UM IS VERY GOOD
UM
BECAUSE RECENTLY UH I SAW NEWS ITEM ON T. V. UM ABOUT
UH NEW TELEPHONES UH FOR ELDER PEOPLE
UM THEY HAVE LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN WITH UH REALLY BIG PICTURES ON IT LIKE UH UH CALL UH HANG UP UM
AND THAT'S A BIG AD ADVANTAGE I THINK BECAUSE
ONE THE ONE HAND UH
YOU MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL COMPATIBLE FOR ELDER USERS JUST BY UH SCALING UP THE PICTURES OR SOMETHING
IT'S UH
VERY VISUAL INTENDED
WHAT WAS I TO SAY MORE
YEAH
YEAH OKAY BUT BUT IF YOU PICK THE THE IDEA THE LEFT IDEA
THEN WHAT'S GONNA BE DISPLAYED ON THE TOUCH SCREEN
YEAH BUT L LIKE MENU FUNCTIONS OR
AH OKAY
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH OF COURSE
YEAH I HAD ANOTHER UH IDEA ABOUT MAYBE PARENTAL CONTROL
UM
LIKE BUILDING IN UH SOME KIND OF PIN CODE UH WHICH ALLOWS UH PARENTS TO SWITCH TO ALL CHANNELS
UH BUT CHILDREN UH IF CHILDREN DON'T DON'T KNOW THE PIN CODE THEY CAN'T SWITCH TO UH VIOLENT UH CHANNELS OR
TH THERE'S JUST
JU JUST A SIMPLE LOG IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
YEAH TH THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT MAYBE UM IF YOU LOG IN FIRST AS A PARENT UM
YOU ADDRESS THE THE CHANNELS AND LIKE UH OH THAT'S CHANNEL FIFTEEN THAT'S UH
VI VIOLENT CHANNEL UH M MY KI MY KIDS UH I DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO WATCH THAT THEN YOU SET THE PRIORITY TO ONLY PARENTS
FOR EXAMPLE
BUT
YEAH OKAY BUT BUT YEAH THAT'S JUST
THAT'S AN A AN ADDED FEATURE
YEAH TH TH THOSE THINGS ARE NICE
PARTIAL
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT BUT IF YOU DISPLAY IT ON L. C. D. SCREEN WITH R R REALLY BIG NUMBERS
THAT'S JUST AS E JUST AS EASY
YEAH
YEAH IT'S DIFFERENT
YEAH AGE B BELOW FORTY
AND TH THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE YEAH
Y YOU SAW IT IN MY MARKETING REPORT THEY LIKE THE NEW FANCY STUFF SO
A TOUCH SCREEN LIKE MICROSOFT AL ALREADY DEVELOPED SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR UH UH MULTI MEDIA APPLICATIONS
I TH I THINK WE CAN DO THAT TOO
DONE
YEAH YEAH SOME OF THEM
THE MENUS UH ARE NOT IDENTICAL FOR ALL TH FOR ALL T. V. S SO YOU HAVE TO DISPLAY IT ON ONE UH T. V.
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE
MM-HMM MM YEAH
ADD TH THAT THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
YEAH
BUT
NO
NO NO NO
HE HE HE HE ME HE MEANS JUST JUST ONE OTHER THING
UH WITH THE CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS THE UNIVERSAL ONES UM YOU HAVE TO PRESS YEAH YOU HAVE TO PRESS A CODE FOR T. V.
YEAH
YEAH
NOW WE UH JUST CONNECT UH THE T. V. TYPE UH TO A SET OF OPTIONS IN JUST JUST IN THE MEMORY
SO THAT IF YOU YEAH LIKE PROFILE SO THAT IF YOU UH TOUCH IN LIKE UH ONE FOUR ONE ZERO KIND OF T. V. UH
THE MEMORY UH
POPS UP THE OPTIONS
I TH DON'T THINK THAT'S UH THAT TAKES A LOT OF STORAGE SPACE OR SOME JUST VARIA VARIABLES
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ON THE OTHER HAND UH IF YOU HAVE A REMOTE AND BUY A NEW T. V. THAT ISN'T INCORPORATED IN THE REMOTE
NEW REMOTE
A FIRMWARE UPGRADE OR SOMETHING BUT FROM WHERE
AH
MAYBE W
NO M MAY NO MAYBE WE CAN INCORPORATE SOME KIND OF UH U. S. B. OR A FIREWIRE CONNECTION
SO THAT YOU CAN UH CONNECT IT TO THE P. C. AND DOWNLOAD THE NEWEST FIRMWARE FROM UH FROM THE INTERNET
YEAH LIKE A S KIND OF SERVICE CENTRE
YEAH
YEAH
I I THINK IT'S UH
MOST CHEAP OR CHEAPEST TO JUST DO THE UPDATES UH AT THE SERVICE CENTRE OR AT THE SHOP
IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT A LOT OF WORK JUST ONE UH DOCKING STATION WHERE YOU PUT IT IN PRESS START BLING BLING UPDATED
YEAH
YOU DON'T BUY A T. V. EVERY WEEK NEW TEEV SO
LET'S VOTE
MY VOTE TOO
AND YOUR VOTE
YEAH
AND ALSO LIKE A CLAPPING UH
LI LIKE DEVICE THAT UH POPS OPEN
UH TOO DIFFICULT UM MAYBE UH IT'S EASIER TO BREAK IT
YEAH TH TH TH THAT I UH
YEAH
LIKE MY TELEPHONE IT'S UH IT'S SENSITIVE TOO
AH
THIRTY MINUTES
HOW MINUTES
ONE QUESTION UH HOW LATE DO WE HAVE TO GET BACK BE BACK HERE
THIRTY MINUTES LUNCH BREAK
I THOUGHT FORTY FIVE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH ME TOO
SAVE AS
YEAH V
BUT BUT YOU CAN OPEN A FROM YOUR PR FROM YOUR LAPTOP
YEAH MAYBE
SAVE AS
NO
EXPORT
EXPORT H. T. M. L.
HUH IMAGE
PAPER SIZE A. FOUR
UH SCREEN SIZE
IN THIS DIRECTORY
NO
YEAH IT IS CONNECTED
YEAH I THINK SO
OH
THANK YOU
YEAH OF COURSE
TO MY EXAVE EXECUTIVE
AYE
YEAH
OKAY
HELLO AGAIN
MM YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YES
YES
YOUR PROJECT MANAGER
WELCOME TO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
FOR REAL REACTION
UH HELLO AGAIN
UH IT'S UH THE SAME AS THE LAST TIME
UH UH ALSO THIS TIME THERE WILL BE UH THREE PRESENTATIONS
AND WE UM MUST UH REACH A DECISION ON UH THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS
UM UH AND AT THE END UH I UH WHEN I FINISH IT OFF I HAVE SOME UH INPUT FROM UH A MASTER CLASS I UH VISITED
INFORMATION
THE THE THE THE THE CONCEPTS ON UH WE UH WHERE WE UH MUST REACH A DECISION ON
UM UH OUR FROM UH ARE OF TWO SORTS
COMPONENTS CONCEPTS AND USER INTERFACE CONCEPTS
UH THE FIRST ONE IS UH REALLY ABOUT THE THE THE THE THE TOTAL PACKAGE UH WITH UH WELL
WE HAVE DECIDED TO DO A DO THE UH WITH A TOUCH SCREEN THAT MUST BE A CASE AROUND IT SO UH IT WON'T BE UH UH AS BREAKABLE
UH HOW HOW ABOUT THE ENERGY
CAN YOU UH CAN YOU RELOAD IT OR UH JUST HAVE BATTERIES WHICH YOU MUST EXCHANGE
UH THE USER INTERFACE CONCEPT
UH WITH THE TYPE AND UH THE THE SUPPLEMENTS
SO UH WHERE TO PUT WHAT BUTTON
AND UH UH I WOULD SAY UH JANS CAN YOU BEGIN
OKAY
AT THE END UH I WILL TAKE NOTES UH AND AT THE END OF THE MINUTES UH WILL UH BE AT THE SHARED FOLDER
MM-HMM
ONE ONE LITTLE QUESTION
UM ABOUT THE THE MATERIAL
UH A SOFT MATERIAL FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
YEAH
THANK YOU
MM-HMM
OH
BUT YOU PREFER KINETIC
OKAY
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T MOVE A A REMOTE CONTROL TOO MUCH
AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO TO KEEP THE ENERGY LEVEL UH
OKAY
OKAY
THANK YOU TIM
YEAH
DYNAMIC DYNAMIC LOOK
A LITTLE ARTISTIC
OKAY
IT'S SOFT
THAT'S THE MATERIAL THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT UH AIN'T IT
JUST LIKE THE WATCH FROM SEIKO
YEAH
I I UH I WOULD PREFER UH BOTH UH TOO
YEAH
COMBINE THEM
RUBBER
YEAH
YEAH
MM YEAH
ME TOO
YEAH
OKAY
MM YEAH
THANK YOU
YEAH
DO YOUR THING TIM
BRING IT ON
YEAH
FLASHY
YEAH
YEAH BUT WOOD IS NOT A NOT A MATERIAL YOU WHICH YOU BUILD A A REMOTE CONTROL OF
YEAH BUT NEVER SEEN ONE
CASE
OH A WOODEN LOOK YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
WOULD YOU PREFER UH UH THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE THE COLOUR OF YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL OR
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
MAYBE YOU COULD USE YOUR REMOTE AS A PHONE
THERE ARE NUMBERS ON IT SO UH
SO THAT YOU SAY UM S. P. S. S. AND IT GOES TO UH OKAY
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T USE THAT TH GAMES WHEN YOU WATCHING TELEVISION I THINK
YEAH OKAY
YOU TAKE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH YOU
UH GREAT
OH OKAY
UH
I THINK WE CAN DISCUSS A LITTLE ABOUT THE THE THREE UH KIND OF REVOLUTIONARY THINGS UH TIM UH CAME WITH
THE PARENTAL CONTROL THE GAMES AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION
UH
THERE'S N NOT UH TOO MUCH DECISION ON UH THAT ONE SO UH I THINK THAT PARENTAL CONTROL IS A GOOD FUNCTION TO UH TO PUT IN THE REMOTE
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU THINK ABOUT IT
YEAH
YEAH
NO BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE UH FIND IT UH MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT THEIR CHILDREN DON'T WATCH UH SEX OR VIOLENCE UH ON THE TELEVISION
AND UH WAIT UH TEN OR FIFTEEN SECONDS LONGER SO THEY CAN UH FINALLY WATCH IT UH BECAUSE OF THAT
UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT'S A B THERE'S A BIG MARKET FOR IT BECAUSE UH YOU YEAH
YOU READ MANY TIMES IN MAGAZINES SAME KIND OF STUFF AND YOU HEARD ON THE NEWS THAT UH THAT HE YEAH
THEY BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN UH ARE INFLUENCED BY THE TELEVISION AND UH WELL WE'RE WE'RE AIMING UH TO UH BELOW UH FORTY UH YEARS
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF UH PEOPLE WILL BELOW FORTY WHO HAVE UH CHILDREN IN YOUNG AGE UH WHO WHO WANT UM TO UH NOT WATCH UH VIOLENT OR UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
THAT'S A THAT'S A BETTER IDEA
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH WITH AND ONE WITHOUT
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE IT CAN WORK WITH SHOW VIEW
UH YOU YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR VIDEO RECORDER WITH SHOW VIEW
UH WHEN YOU TICK IN A NUMBER IT WILL UH START AND END UH RECORDING
BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOME OPTION THAT UH THAT T UH THE KIND OF SHOW VIEW NUMBERS ARE VIOLENT AND THAT THEY ARE BLOCKED OUT
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
I WOULDN'T PUT IT IN AN OPTIONAL DEVICE
THAT THAT THEN THEN THEN IT BECOMES TOO MUCH I THINK
IF WE DO IT WE WE MUST DO IT IN A KIND OF WAYS THAT LIKE A PROFILE
A PARENT PROFILE AND A FAMILY PROFILE AND OTHERWISE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
AND WHAT DO YOU UH GUYS THINK OF THE GAMES IN THE VOICE RECOGNITION
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THAT BECOMES TOO MUCH
IT'S MORE LIKE IT GETS YOU TO THE FUNCTIONALITY BUT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
AND GAMES
THAT WOULD
OKAY
SO THAT WILL UH THAT THAT THAT MUST BE IN IT YOU THINK
OKAY
SO THE GAMES UH ARE IN IT
THE VOICE RECOGNITION ARE NOT
AND THE PARENTAL CONTROL ARE
OPTIONAL
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
UH BUT UH WILL THERE UH UH LIKE THE FIRST IDEA UH FROM UH YOU CAN BUY IT WITHOUT AND UH WITH PARENTAL CONTR CONTROL
OR ARE WE GOING TO PUT IT IN AND UH JUST UH
YEAH
MM YEAH
YEAH YOU YO YEAH BUT MOST OFTEN NOT
YEAH
OKAY
SO UH I THINK WE HAVE DECIDED ON THE THINGS THAT UH FROM JANUS THE ENERGY THE COMBINATION BETWEEN BATTERY AND KINETIC
THE CASE WILL BE DOUBLE CURVED AND UH RUBBER IN A FR FLASHY FRUITY COLOUR UH THAT WITH COVER IS REMOVABLE
THE BUTTONS WILL BE UH TOUCH SCREEN
UH BUT THERE MAY NOT BE TOO MANY BUTTONS
AND IN THE THE MENU STRUCTURE UH THERE MUST NOT TO BE UH
FIVE MINUTES TO GO
UH TOO UH TOO MANY LEVELS
AND UH IT MUST BE EASY TO USE
THE PARENTAL CONTROL WILL BE INCORPORATED BUT IT MUST BE NOT TOO COMPLEX
AND THE GAMES ARE IN IT
SO
I THINK WE HAVE UH WE HAVE DECIDED UH OKAY
UH LITTLE MORE
YEAH
LIKE A LIKE A MOAT OR S OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE THAT IN THE
YEAH
YOU USE THE
YEAH
IT'S ALREADY INCORPORATED A LITTLE IN THAT CONCEPT
OKAY
WE TAKE IT TO THE OTHER MEETING OKAY
I HAVE A LITTLE W UH LITTLE CHAT TO DO AND UH THEN WE UH FINISH
I WENT TO UH A MASTER CLASS AND UH UH TWO THINGS UH ARE UH ARE UH CAN COME IN HANDY UH FOR US
FIRST THING UH IS UH WE TALKED ABOUT KNOWLEDGE UH MANAGEMENT
KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING AND UH UH THE FACT THAT UH THAT UH THAT THE IDEA OF KNOWLEDGE UH SHARING AND LEARNING KNOWLEDGE FROM OTHER COMPANIES IS UH LIKE THAT
IT'S IT'S UH VERY HOT AT THE MOMENT SO IT'S IT'S MOSTLY FOR THE MANAGEMENT EXPERT TO TO LOOK WHAT OTHER UH MARKETING OR DID I SAID MANAGEMENT
OH
JUST TALKING ABOUT MYSELF
UH W
WHAT OTHER COMPANIES UH HAD TO UH ALSO WITH THE THE THE THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN WHEN THEY PUT ON A NEWER REMOTE JUST SOME UH YEAH
IMPORT EXPORT
AND UH ANOTHER ONE
UH THEY'RE A HA THEY'RE AT YEAH BENCHMARKING THAT'S THE WORD I SAW
I UH COULDN'T UH OKAY UH ANOTHER UH THING IS UH THERE WERE THERE THERE WAS A SURVEY
AND UM UH IT CAME OUT THAT UM PEOPLE LIKE TO BUY THINGS FROM A SINGLE LARGE PROVIDER INSTEAD OF THOSE WHO UH ARE PARTNERING UH WITH US
SO WE MUST UH WE MUST BRING IT AS IF UH REAL REACTION IS UH IS BIG COMPANY UH A TRUSTFUL COMPANY AND UH IT HAS M
OKAY
I HAD A I HAD ANOTHER IDEA TO PUT UH UH THE WHOLE THE WHOLE IDEA OF UH REAL REACTION AND UH UH UH A SINGLE BRAND AND UH UH THAT KIND OF THING
WHEN YOU UH PUT ON REMOTE YOU SEE A KIND OF A JUST LIKE WHEN YOU TELEPHONE YOU SEE A LITTLE UH ANIMATION
REAL REACTION REMOTE
AND UH WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE MOTTO WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
AND THEN YOU GO UH
THE
YEAH
BUT W TH THE IDEA FROM THIS UH THING IS THAT WE MUST PRESENT IT AS A AS WE ARE A A SINGLE LARGE PROVIDER WHO WILL STAND ON OUR OWN
MM YEP YEAH
ALSO ALSO
BUT WE WE ARE UH
YEAH YEAH Y YEAH YEAH
OKAY BUT UH THINK ABOUT THAT KIND OF THINGS
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID IN THE MASTER CLASS
N UH NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES
SO UH MAYBE YOU CAN GO TO PARIS AND MILAN UH ONCE AGAIN
THE MASTER CLASS
FRANZ MEHLER'S
UH VERY SPECIAL UH NEXT UH SESSION
UH IDEA THAT YOU UH THE THE INDUSTRIAL UH DEVELOPMENT UH CENTRE AND UH USER INTERFACE UH WILL WORK TOGETHER ON A PROTOTYPE
AND UH WILL DRAWING IT ON THE SMARTBOARD
SO THAT'S A KINDA NEW UH THING
AND UM THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL UH WILL UH KE HE WILL BE KEEPING BUSY WITH THE PRODUCT UH EVALUATION
BUT THE MOST UH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY EMAIL
YEAH THE WELL UH DIDS THIS WHAT I UH WHAT I HEARD
I
NOT IN THE MASTER CLASS
SO YOU UH JUST WAIT FOR THE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AND UH BUT I THINK IT WAS A VERY UH VERY GOOD UH SESSION UH GENTLEMEN
I WILL THANK YOU ALL
AND UH
GIVE ME A GOOD EVALUATION
CHEERS
SEE YOU IN A HALF HOUR
BUT KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR UH LAPTOPS FOR A REAL UH
YEAH BUT TH THERE'S THERE'S STILL THE MY UH INSTRUCTIONS THAT YOU WILL WORK TOGETHER
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM
BYE BYE
THE PROJECT MANAGER ALWAYS WORKS ALONE
HELLO
UM PROJECT MANAGER I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEMS WITH MY LAPTOP
AND UH S S S SO I HAD A LITTLE LESS TIME TO COMPLETE
NO A LITTLE PROBLEM UH BIG PROBLEM
I JUST THOUGHT UM IT DIDN'T WORK ANYMORE
THE ENTIRE WINDOWS UH
IT IT HUNG
DURING LUNCH YEAH
HE'S THE MASTER YEAH
WOW
OH HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE OPTION OF USING A SOLAR PANEL
W NAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
TH TH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
YEAH
UM I THINK YOU SHOULD USE KINETIC AS A BACK UP
A COMBINATION YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
PSYCHO KINETIC
YEAH
BUY A FIFTY CENTS BATTERY AND UH
WELL MAYBE I HAVE SOMETHING IN MY PRESENTATION TO UH TO COPE WITH THAT
UM ISN'T POSSIBLE TO MAKE COMBINATION WITH KIND OF RUBBER IS OR BENDABLE REMOTES WHERE YOU'VE GOT A
OR DO YOU THINK IT RUBBER CASING YEAH
YEAH
UM WELL D MAYBE I CAN ASK IT RIGHT NOW THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE
UH IS IT POSSIBLE UH OF IS IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A TOUCH SCREEN SQUARE
IT ISN'T I THINK YEAH
WE'RE WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS SO MAYBE WE CAN UH
MM YEAH
MM-HMM
OH YEAH
OKAY I I GET IT
OKAY
THAT'S GOOD
WELL AS LONG A AS LONG AS IT'S IT'S UH IT'S FIRM
AND YOU DON'T UH IT'S NOT BENDABLE OR SOMETHING I TH I THINK THAT GOES TOO FAR
OH
OKAY
IT MIGHT EVEN BOUNCE BACK WHEN YOU DROP IT ON THE FLOOR
OKAY
DO YOUR THING
SPONGEBALL
IT'LL FLOAT
TABLES
AH
HEY
TWELVE FIFTY UH
WHEN YOUR PARENTS ARE WATCHING SOME BORING PROGRAM YOU CAN TAKE THE REMOTE AND DO SOMETHING ELSE
TAKE IT
OOH
S
MM-HMM
IN
OKAY
UM THE INTERFACE CONTENTS
WELL THAT'S A JUST SIMPLE POWERPOINT MOCK UP I WANT TO M MAKE IT MORE AS DYNAMIC FOR YOU SO I'LL DRAW THERE
BUT THE MAIN CONCEPT IS UM TAKE ONE BIG TOUCH SCREEN
UM ALWAYS DISPLAY THE PRIMARY BUTTONS CLEAR AND VISIBLE
MAYBE EVEN LI LIKE THIS WITH UH U USES OF A LOT OF SPACE
AND UH MAKE THE MENU STRUCTURE CHANGEABLE
SO IF YOU PRESS UM SYSTEM THAT'S YEAH WELL M MULTIPLE SYSTEM OPTIONS CAN MAYBE FIVE OR TEN OR OR ONE CAN FIT IN
OR MAYBE EVEN A STEP FURTHER WHEN YOU WANT TO UM
T UM HAVE SOME OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT PROGRAMMABLE WITH ONE HORIZONTAL BUTTON
AND UM OTHER BUTTONS CAN MAY BE DISPLAYED HERE IF THAT'S NECESSARY
AND UM WELL HOW DO UH DO WE WANT TO LOOK AT UH UH F UM YEAH DOES A REMOTE LOOK WELL
IT'S YOU'VE GOTTA HOLD IT IN ONE HAND
SO UM THE MIDDLE LIKE ALL REMOTES HAVE TO BE IN A LITTLE BIT SMALL SO YOU CAN PUT IT IN
INSIDE YOUR HANDS
AND SOME REMOTES YOU CAN USE WITH YOUR THUMB
BUT I THINK THAT'S TOO DIFFICULT FOR THIS ONE
SO YOU CAN MAKE IT S A LITTLE BROADER
YEAH
AND HERE
AND MAYBE USE YOUR THUMB
ON THE ON THE MAIN BUTTONS
AND USE YOUR OTHER HANDS
ON THE MENU STRUCTURE
SO HERE ARE GONNA BE THE PROGRAM BUTTONS
ONE TWO THREE FOUR ET CETERA
AND THE THE VOLUME CONTROL AND PROGRAM CONTROL MAYBE
AND DOWN HERE
UM I ADDED THIS COULD BE ONE UH BIG L. C. D.
UM THE MENU STRUCTURE
SO YOU CAN USE IT IN UH IN THIS WAY
UM
ONE THING YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP IN MIND KEEP THE REMOTE CLEAR OF TOO MUCH FUNCTIONS AT THE SAME TIME
UM KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE CHANGING THE MENU STRUCTURE HERE UM
AND WELL I STILL BELIEVE YOU SHOULD KEEP DISPLAYING THE BUTTONS
BUT IF YOU'RE PROGRAMMING THE COLOUR OF THE T. V. DO NOT DISPLAY TWENTY OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE POSSIBLE
JUST KEEP IT AS SIMPLE AS UH AS POSSIBLE
AND DO NOT USE TOO MANY LEVELS
DO NOT HAVE TO SELECT A SCREEN FIRST AND THEN BRIGHTNESS AND THEN COLOUR AND UN PLUS AND UM PUSH PLUS TWENTY TIMES
BUT JUST THE UM UH JUST IN ONE BUTTON IF POSSIBLE
AND UM WELL YOU KN YOU ALL KNOW THE T. V. LEVELS
UM CHANNEL ONE TWO
AND WHEN YOU GET TO N TO UH TO TEN YE AND WANT TO GO BACK UH WELL YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
JUST M MOST MOST MODERN T. V. S YOU YOU PRESS ONE ZERO AND IT GOES TO TEN
AND ELSE TO ONE AND THROUGH AFTER THAT
SO THE S A BUTTON LESS
AND UM THINGS LIKE TELETEXT PUT THEM IN THE MENU
THINGS LIKE UM UM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH W YEAH I I FIND I MUST TRYING TO UH TELL IT
IS UH VOLUME PLUS AND MINUS
AND THIS IS PROGRAM UH PLUS
AND MINUS
UH
YES
OR IF YOU'RE WATCHING STUDIO SPORTS ON UH ON SEVENTEEN AND YOUR WIFE IS WATCHING SOME SOAP ON TWO WELL YES I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
BUT UM WELL M MY PREFERENCE WOULD TO BE PUT IT IN THE MENU STRUCTURE
AND IF YOU'RE USING THAT BUTTON A LOT OF TIMES WELL OF COURSE THE MENU WILL STILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN
YOU JUST DON'T HAVE TO PLAY GAMES UH IN BETWEEN
BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY SWITCHING BETWEEN TWO CHANNELS YOU WON'T HAVE TIME UH TO D USE THE OTHER OPTIONS
UM YEAH ALREADY ALREADY TOLD THAT
YEAH
THAT'S MY CONCLUSION
WELL I AGREE JUST PUT IT IN THE MENU STRUCTURE SOMEWHERE
UM YEAH UM SYSTEM PROPERTIES UM PARENTAL CONTROL
YEAH
MM
UM W WELL YEAH
IT IT HAS TO BE FAST
YOU DON'T WANT TO TO GO DOWN AND WATCH THE NEWS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND TURN IT ON AND WAIT TWENTY SECONDS FOR FOR UH THE LOG ON SCREEN AND THEN REMEMBER YOUR CODE AND ALL KINDS OF SETTINGS
MM-HMM
WHY
MM-HMM
YOU C MAY USE LIKE WHEN THERE'S UH X. P. UH A SIMPLE LOG ON D YOU JUST PUSH UH ONE OR TWO OR THREE
AND IF YOU PUSH PARENTS THEN YEAH
TO LOG IN
YEAH
AND IF YOU PUTS A YE
UH-HUH
AND IF YOU W YOU PUSH P CHILDREN UH YOU DON'T HAVE TO UH LOG IN BUT YOU CAN ONLY WATCH UH CHILDREN'S CHANNELS OR UH OKAY
WELL
YEAH
WELL MAYBE UM SOME IDEA ON THAT
JUST MAKE THROUGH A REMOTE AS IT IS BUT MAKE AN OPTION TO INSERT PROFILES
'CAUSE IF MY GRANDAD WOULD BUY THIS REMOTE HE WOULDN'T WANT TO BOTHER WITH ALL ALL THE ALL THE UH THINGS TO DO
JUST MAKE IT AN OPTION IN MENU INS INSTALL POWERFUL PROFILES OR SOMETHING
UM B WELL STILL SOME QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT HOW TO INCORPORATE THOSE ONES
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SOME CHANNELS THEY UH CANNOT SEE BUT WELL I I WHEN I THINK OH YEAH FOR THE F FOR ALL THE STANDARD CHANNELS
AND ONLY FOR MAYBE AFTER TEN O'CLOCK UH IN THE EVENING VIOLENT FILMS AND MOVIES UH WILL COME AND UH MAYBE MAYBE SOME SOME TIMING UH WILL BE UH NEEDED INSTEAD OF UH OF CHANNELS
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WATCHING UH I DON'T KNOW YOU'RE IN THE AT DAY UH CARTOONS WILL COME UP M ON MAYBE FRIDAY NIGHT
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH THE DISADVANTAGE VANTAGE IS THAT SOMEONE WILL HAS TO SEND ALL THE SHOW VIEW NUMBERS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY REMOTES AND EDIT IT ALL
WILL HAVE TO DECIDE UH
THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE
WELL YEAH YOU COULD SAY IF PARENTAL CONTROL IS ONLY IT IT'LL GO FROM FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN WITH THE PAGE UP THEN BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH ON A SEPARATE MENU UH OPTION
YEAH WELL YEAH I
A MAIL TOO FROM MANAGEMENT THAT IT'S VERY POPULAR TO USE VOICE RECON RECOGNITION
BUT I DON'T THINK WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. UH HEARING LOUD NOISES FROM THE T. V. SOMEONE SCREAMING ONE AND YOU F THE CHANNEL SWITCHES UH YEAH
YEAH
W YOU CAN PUT IT ON CHIP ANYWAY SO UH
AS LONG AS IT'S ISN'T A PRIMARY FEATURE OF THE REMOTE BUT UH
OPTIONAL IN
BUT HOW WE DO IT
WELL I THINK ALSO IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUTS VERY DIFFICULT TO INCORPORATE
SO WE SHOULD MAKE IT TOO COMPLEX
IS T SOME MENU UH FUNCTION YOU CHOOSE PARENTAL CONTROL AND MAYBE FOUR FILES WILL EMERGE FROM MENU WHERE PUT IT ON
BUT UH HOW HOW IT'S GONNA WORK UH UH WILL F BE A PROBLEM
MM-HMM
WELL
YE I I THINK BEST WOULD BE UH TO PUT IT IN AND MAKE IT AN MENU OPTION
YOU CAN PUT ON YEAH
AND YOU CAN JUST UH S WHEN YOU BUY IT YOU CAN SELECT UM PERSONAL PREFERENCE PARENTAL CONTROL ON AND THE PASSWORD OR SOMETHING
OH IT'S A P YEAH
WELL MAYBE YOU JUST HAVE TO RESTRICT IT TO WHAT PROGRAMS WHERE THE PARENT SAYS YOU CANNOT WATCH CHANNEL SEVEN
NINE AND TEN AND YOU CANNOT WATCH ALL CHANNELS AFTER TEN O'CLOCK
AND THERE'S JUST SOME LITTLE UH CLOCK IN THE REMOTE
NO NO IT'S VERY SIMPLE
THERE UH TH I H I'VE SEEN SOME OF REMOTES WHO HAVE A CLOCK IN IT
SO THE REMOTE DOES DOESN'T TRANSMIT WHEN IT'S AFTER TWELVE CLOCK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL THAT'S TO PUT IT VERY BLUNT THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM
JUST HAVE UM THE PARENTS BUY UH SOME GLUE AND UH IT'S NOT NOT A PART OF THE REMOTE
YOU HAVE TO F YEAH
UH OR MAKE IT OURSELVES VERY DIFFIC
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OH
YEAH
I'M LISTENING
UM WELL
WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT IS JUST A MENU STRUCTURE WHEN YOU DON'T USE IT IS SIMPLE
AND WHEN YOU PUSH UH SYSTEM PROPERTIES UH ENTIRE LIST POPS UP WITH E EV ALL KIND OF F STUFF YOU CAN PROGRAM
SOM SOME BENCH MARKER
OH
UH LOGO
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL YOU CAN SHOW SOMEBODY A LOGO FOR POINT FIVE SECONDS THEY'LL STILL REMEMBER IT
AND IT IT L LINGER ON EVERY TIME YOU SEE IT
VERY ANNOYING
YEAH
YEAH I IT'S OK FOR F
OH FOR THE NEXT MEETING RIGHT
UM
STAY HERE AND
P.
AH NO NEW EMAIL
OKAY
THANK YOU
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YEAH
UH-HUH
SEE YOU
YEAH
HERE
OR UH
YEAH
IF YOU GOT A NO
SO STUPID MANAGER
NO
DON'T GET WHAT'S
HI
YEAH SURE
OKAY
UH LET ME SEE
I THINK IT'S THIS ONE
HA
RIGHT
UH WELL I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPONENTS
UH WHAT I DID WAS I REVIEWED PREVIOUSLY USED ITEMS UH BY UH TWO TWO UH DIFFERENT UH AGE GROUPS
UH BELOW FORTY FIVE AND ABOVE
AND UH I JUST UH WATCH WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE AND I CHECKED UH WELL WHAT WHAT D DO WE WANT
AND HOW CAN WE UH D AIM A AT UH THE TARGET GROUP
WELL UH WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT A SENIOR UM
SENIOR CITIZENS UH
YE AH IT'S IT'S OKAY
UH THEY WELL THEY LIKE MORE THE THEY LIKE THE TRADITIONAL MATERIALS LIKE WOOD AND AND SUCH MORE
WOOD AND CHROME
AND UH UH THEY LIKE UH STRAIGHTFORWARD SHAPES
UM UH THEY THEY THEY THEY LIKE LUXURIOUS UH STYLES WHERE WHEREAS THE YOUNG AND DYNAMIC THEY LIKE A MORE UH SOFT MATERIALS
THINK OF THE TELETUBBIES FOR INSTANCE
UH UH SOFT AND FLUFFY AND COLOURFUL AND WELL UH SHAPES ARE CURVED AND ROUND
Y Y YOU GET THE PICTURE
AND UH THEY LIKE SPORTS AND GAMING AND THAT GIVES THEM UH THE VITALITY
UH SO W WELL UH FIRS YES
YEAH
NO I'LL I'LL GET TO THAT
YOU YOU'LL SEE
YEAH
UH WELL F FIRST OFF LET'S START START WITH THE ENERGY
W I UH I HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN UH A FEW DIFFERENT UH SOURCES
BUT UH THE TWO BASIC SOURCES THAT I FOUND WERE THE BEST POSSIBLE WERE THE BATTERY UH VERSUS KINETIC
UH KINETIC THAT'S WHEN YOU MOVE SOMETHING THEN UH IT GETS ENERGY
I FIGURED WELL THAT'S KI KINDA HIGH TECH WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT WELL WHEN YOU PICK IT UP IT HAS POWER
THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY VERY NICE UH I FIGURED
WELL WE COULD ALSO USE A BATTERY THAT'S A BIT
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YOU C JUST YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT
AND THEN THEN IT D THEN IT HAS SOME MORE UH ENERGY
WELL Y YOU COULD JUST GO FOR A BATTERY
OR YOU CAN GO FOR BOTH
YEAH I ACTUALLY DID
BUT UH THE THING IS ABOUT SOLAR PANEL IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE L UH LIGHT
WELL SUNLIGHT PREFERABLY
UH AND YOU YOU COULD YOU COULD USE NORMAL LIGHT BUT UH YOU WOULDN'T GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT YOU WOULD FROM A BATTERY OR SOMETHING
UH FOR UH ULTIMATE B UH N UH USE OF UH SOLAR PANELS YOU COULD ACTUALLY USE UH YOU COULD USE UH SOLAR PANELS
BUT UH YOU HA YOU'D HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THEM INTO UH THE REMOTE CONTROL LEAVING YOU UH A BIT LESS SPACE FOR THE INTERFACE
SO UH SO I I IT IT WO WHAT'S ACTUALLY I I C JUST IN F I'VE FIGURED IT OUT THAT WELL
UH SEEING THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE UH WITHIN THE L UH DISTANCE OF T. V. AND THE FROM T. V. THERE COMES A A A WHOLE BUNCH OF LIGHT
SO IT WOULD ACTUALLY POWER ITSELF UH FROM A T. V.
BUT WELL YOU JUST TAKE UP ALL THE SPACE AND YOU WOULDN'T UH HAVE THE FULL AMOUNT OF POWER ACTUALLY USED
SO I I PREFER KINETIC BECAUSE IT'S UH WELL THE COSTS AREN'T THAT MUCH HIGHER
AND UM JU JUST A BIT MORE HIGH TECH THAN THAN A NORMAL BATTERY
I MEAN IF
NO BUT UH D WELL YOU PICK IT UP AND YOU PRESS BUTTONS AND Y WELL YOU
YEAH WELL UH ACTUALLY IT IS
AND IT IT IF IT ISN'T YOU JUST SHAKE IT A BIT AND AND ADD ADD WITH POWER UP AGAIN
BUT WHAT L WHAT JAREK SAID YOU COULD YOU COULD USE A BATTERY THAT YOU'D JUST KEEP IT ON THE RECHARGING WHENEVER IT MOVES
AND FOR REST YOU'D JUST ADD JUICE ON THE BATTERY
EXACTLY
AND SO THAT UH UH WELL F FURTHERMORE YOU YOU WE UH CHECKED UH THE CASES
WE HAVE UH DIFFERENT OPTIONS UH CONCERNING THE CASES
YOU HA I YOU SIM UH YOU SIMPLY ADD A BASIC UH STANDARD UH MODEL UH IT WAS KIND OF SQUARE AND UH I FIGURED THAT'S A BIT BORING
SO YOU YOU WE COULD GO FOR UH THE SINGLE CURVED OR THE DOUBLE CURVED
UM SINGLE CURVE IT'S JUST A WELL UH YOU KNOW IT'S JUST UH A NICE CURVE
OR BUT BUT YOU COULD GO IN A IN AN DOUBLE CURVES
AND THAT'S LIKE SEVERAL DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS
THAT GIVES YOU AN WHOLE NEW UH EFFEC
YEAH THAT GIVES YOU A YOUNGER AND UH MORE HIGH TECH LOOK I F I FIGURED
BUT THAT UH WE'LL DISCUSS LATER
WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO DRAW IN THREE D.
UH YEAH I CA I CA I COULD I COULD SHOW YOU
I COULD SHOW YOU
WELL UH LET'S SAY Y UH YOU UH
LET'S SAY THAT'S YOUR STANDARD UH
THAT'S A BIT YOUR D STANDARD DESIGN
BUT YOU COULD ACTUALLY GO LIKE UH SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AND THEN UH IN THREE D. EFFECT YOU COULD GO
SO Y YOU YOU JUST
YEAH THIS IS A THIS BIT UH DIFFICULTY IN I DIDN'T TAKE A MAJOR IN ART
SO BUT BUT YOU COULD HAVE UH UH A WHOLE NEW UH THE BACK BACK THE THE THE DEPTH
YOU COULD YOU COULD UH JUST PLAY AROUND A BIT WITH
YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE STANDARD UH
YEAH YOU COULD Y IT LEAVES MORE SPACE FOR CREATIVITY
UH THAT MIGHT BE AN IDEA BUT JUST A WELL FURTHERMORE UH WELL UH PLASTIC VERSUS RUBBER
YOU WE COULD CHOOSE UH WHAT UH WHAT'S BETTER PLASTIC UM OR RUBBER
I I CH PREFER RUBBER BECAUSE IT FEELS UH YEAH
YEAH IT'S SOFT AND IT'S THAT I LIKE SOFT
YEAH YEAH I MEAN UH PLASTIC UH IS PLASTIC ALSO HAS THAT CHEAP FEELING TO IT
LIKE PLASTIC UH YOUR YOUR I USUALLY ASSOCIATE PLASTIC WITH UH SOMETHING THAT'S CHEAP
UH THAT'S MAYBE JUST ME BUT UH WE COULD UH
UH OH TALK ABOUT IT LATER
UH FURTHERMORE BUTTONS
UH TRADITIONAL UH OR A TOUCH SCREEN
WELL WE DISCUSSED IT IN A PREVIOUS MEETING SO I FIGURED I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THE L. C. D.
AND UH CHIP SET WELL UH IF WE ARE GOING TO USE TRADITIONAL BUTTONS WE COULD GO UH WITH A SIMPLE CHIP SET
BUT UH IF WE DECIDE TO GO ON A N UH UM L. C. D. SCREEN WE WOULD USE AN UH WE HAVE TO USE AN A ADVANCED CHIP SET
AND THAT WOULD BRING UH THE NECESSARY COSTS WITH WITH IT
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE TH HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND
IF IT ISN'T UH MANAGEABLE UH BUDGET WISE WE'D HAVE TO GO OVER TO UH TO SIM TO SIMPLE BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH PROBABLY
YEAH PROBABLY BUT BUT UH YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THAT SHOULDN'T SHOULDN'T BE UH THAT BIG A ISSUE
I'LL I'LL I'LL JUST ADD UH UH I PUT A BIG SUMMARY HERE SO WE COULD DISCUSS IT A BIT
UH WHAT I WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS CONCERNING BATTERY VERSUS KINETIC
YEAH YOU YOU YOU SHOULD WE SHOULD A COMBINATION
UH YOU USE THE BATTERY AND W CHARGE IT UP WITH KINETIC
WHEN YOU PICK IT UP IT CHARGES UP
YEAH
YEAH YEAH I KNOW
YEAH I CON EXACTLY
WHAT UH WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU AGREE
YEAH
BOTH
OKAY
UH WELL THAT WOULD BRING THE M M SOME MORE COSTS BUT I MEAN THE
WHO CARES RIGHT
THAT'S THE PROJECT MANAGER'S PROBLEM
YEAH WELL FIFTY CENT UH UH WHY DOESN'T AND THEN WE HAVE SINGLE CURVED VERSUS DOUBLE CURVED
THAT
OKAY
NO WE'LL WE'LL JUST WAIT AND UH UH PLASTIC VERSUS RUBBER
ANY IDEAS
UH RUBBER
YOU
UH I FIGURED IT WILL BE M RATHER THAN HARD NAH RUBBER C UH THIS IS A CASING YEAH
RUBBER CASING BECAUSE WELL IF YOU USE AN UH D A TOUCH SCREEN UH IT'S JUST A CASING UH AROUND IT
SO UM YOU COULD GO FOR PLASTIC BUT I FIGURED
I I I WOULD CHOOSE RUBBER
WELL M I DON'T KNOW
NO
YEAH
THAT ISN'T
YEAH THAT WOULD COVER IT
THAT THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM
SO MM UH UH SO UH SO WHAT ARE THE OPINIONS
UH RUBBER OR PLASTIC
I I I PREFER RUBBER
YEAH YOU TOO
YOU SURE
YOU YOU YOU SEEMED TO HESITATE A BIT
YEAH IT IT SHOULDN'T IT SHOULDN'T FLOP OVER WHEN YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND UH NO
THAT THAT THAT THAT'S GONNA THE THE CHIP SET WILL HOLD IT FIRM IN PLACE AND UH AND AND UH AND A L. C. D. SCREEN ALSO
YEAH IT M MIGHT IT MIGHT
UH TRA UH TRADITIONAL VERSUS L. C. D. WELL I FIGURED WE WE ALL SET ON THAT
AND UH THEN ALSO THE SIMPLE VERSUS ADVANCED
WELL I FIGURE IF WE GO FOR L. L. C. D. WE WE SHOULD HAVE THE ADVANCED
SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM
OKAY WELL THAT'S MY UH
UH YOU'RE WELCOME
WELL THE TELETUBBIES SH
WELL YOU COULD
YOU YOU COULD
WELL UH
YEAH
WELL I ACTUALLY SAW A PHONE THAT YOU COULD USE AS A REMOTE SO YEAH
HEY
THAT MIGHT BE A NEXT STEP
WELL YEAH
YOU TAKE YOUR UH REMOTE WITH YOU TO SCHOOL
YEAH
VERY NICE
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH UH THE TIME AND EFFORT WE ARE GOING TO SPEND ON IT
BECAUSE WELL IT'S A SIMPLE FUNCTION BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF RESOURCES AND A LOT OF TIME UM TO PROGRAMMING IT
BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO START WORKING WITH THE PROFILES AND SUCH
AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH UH INVESTING THAT MUCH TIME AND EFFORT INTO IT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
BUT WELL IF YOU WANT TO I I I IF WE IN INCORPORATE UH THE PARENTAL CONTROL
UH LET'S SAY WE DO AND AND WELL WHATEVER CHO UH CHILD JUST GOES UP TO THE T. V. AND PRESSES UP FOR INSTANCE
WELL UH NOB NOBODY'S STOPPING THE CHILD FROM UH WELL CHECKING UH THE CHANNEL
BUT THAT
WELL I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE UM FOR THAT TO HAPPEN YOU D YOU WILL HAVE TO RECEIVE A SIGNAL FROM THE UH REMOTE CONTROL
SO IT WOULD YEAH HAVE TO BE CONSTANT UH CONSTANT SIGNALLING
WHAT M WHAT MAY BE BETTER IS TO INCORPORATE AN UH A SEPARATE DEVICE THAT UH THAT YOU CAN PROGRAM WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND THAT UH PROVIDES PARENTAL CONTROL FOR INSTANCE
AND THAT'S JUST AN OPTIONAL UH DEVICE
SO THERE'S N THAT'S THERE'S UH BESIDES UH THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU'LL HAVE A SEPARATE UH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S TRUE BUT UH AT SAME INSTANT SAME HAPPENS WHEN UH YOU HAVE REMOTE CONTROL
SO
BUT ONLY DIFFERENCE IS UH THE UH THE PEOPLE BUYING THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL NOW GET THE F ADDED FEATURE OF PARENTAL CONTROL
AND THOSE PEOPLE WOULDN'T UH NECESSARY WANT IT
SO YOU YOU'D BE
YEAH
YEAH
I CAN SEE GAMES HAPPENING
YEAH
YEAH THAT WILL BE NICE
WELL I DON'T KNOW
I I FIGURE IF YOU HAD TWO DIFFERENT REMOTES YOU COULD BO CHOOSE ONE WITH UH WELL UH UH A RECEIVER IN IT
SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY EASILY UH BUILD IN UH PARENTAL CONTROL
BUT IT WOULD WOULD BE UH MORE EXPENSIVE
SO A AND THAT THAT WAY UH YOU COULD MAKE CHEAP MODEL AND A EXPENSIVE MODEL
COULD MA MAKE THE UH SIMPLE MODEL AND THE DELUXE MODEL UH FOR INSTANCE
YES THEY ARE
YEAH
YEAH YOU YOU HAVE SOME T. V. S ANY
YEAH
THAT IS TRUE THAT IS TRUE
WELL YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD EASILY YOU COULD EASILY YOU COULD EASILY TO THE MOTE CONTROL
BUT YOU STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM ABOUT UH THE TELEVISION ITSELF
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT IS TRUE
YEAH THAT IS TRUE
YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD YOU COULD GO LIKE UH THAT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE UH THINGS A LOT MORE EASY
YOU COULD JUST BLAME IT ON TELEVISION AND UH MAKE IT THEIR PROBLEM
YEAH I FIGURED I FIGURE WE COULD DO THAT
YEAH YEAH SURE
UH I'M NOT SURE WHAT MARKETING THINKS ABOUT IT BUT
USER PROFILE
WELL YEAH YOU YOU COULD ACTUALLY BUILD IN A FUNCTION THAT YOU CAN PROGRAM IT YOURSELF FOR THE MORE ADVANCED USERS
YEAH WHICH BUTTONS DO YOU WANT TO IN IT
BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN LIKE BUILD IN A BACK FORWARD BUTTON AND UH SOME PO SOMEBODY WOULD JUST WANT TO WATCH TWO CHANNELS
YEAH YOU COULD YOU COULD M HAVE PEOPLE WANT UH WANT THAT
AH YEAH SURE
WELL IF YOU IF YOU HAVE THE L L. C. D. SCREEN YOU CAN YOU CAN UH HAVE A SMALL LOGO I UH AT THE BOTTOM
AND IT COULD JUST STAY THERE
YEAH THAT SPINS AROUND OR SOMETHING
HMM
YEAH
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
A SMALL ICON
SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER RIGHT NOW
DEFINITELY
WELL THANK YOU TOO
YOU WISH
M AYE
CHEERS
HEY
YEAH UH I'M NOT SURE IF WE UH WE BECAUSE I SAW SOMETHING ABOUT INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
WELL YEAH
RIGHT
UH
DO YOU HAVE NEW EMAIL
HMM
HEY PROJECT MANAGER
WHAT WAS IT PROBLEM
THE LAPTOP
IT HANG HUNG
HA HA
OH
PROJECT MANAGER
YOU'RE OUR PROJECT MANAGER
MASTER
MASTER OF
I'M SORRY
OKAY
GO ON
YEAH BUT WHEN THE POWER GETS LOW YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT OR SOMETHING
UH AND UH UH
HMM
MM YEAH
IT'S TOO LESS SPACE
AND WHEN THE BATTERY DOESN'T WORK I USUALLY SHAKE IT TOO
SO LIKE SLAMMING ON IT
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME
HMM
BUT ARE YOU GOING TO DRAW IT
THE YEAH
YEAH
UH I C I CAN'T IMAGINE
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HOW HOW IT LOOKS LIKE
YEAH
DESIGN
MM-HMM
UH
OH OKAY
OKAY
OH OKAY
OKAY
WELL I THINK UH WE'RE GOING TO SELL TELL TEN MILLIONS OF THEM
SO UH I BET A BIG COMPANY IN UH KOREA OR TAIWAN LIKE UH SAMSUNG CAN GIVE US UH A BIG DISCOUNT ON THE CHIPS SO
U USUALLY CHIPS ARE UH AREN'T MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ONE DOLLAR
SO
THAT THAT SHOULDN'T BE A REAL ISSUE I THINK
YEAH A COMBINATION
YEAH
LIKE AN UH AKU UH
ACU UH YEAH
WELL
YEAH
COMBINE THEM
OKAY
OF COURSE
FIFTY CENT
RUBBER
RATHER HARD
YEAH
WELL I THINK THAT TOUCH SCREENS ARE GENERALLY SQUARE
BUT IT'S THE CASE YOU PUT AROUND IT THAT MAKES THE SHAPE
HMM
YEAH OKAY BUT IF YOU HAVE A SQUARE UH L. C. D. SCREEN
AND YOU PUT A CASE AROUND IT THAT HAS UH LIKE BULBS OR THAT THAT COVERS PART OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN
THAT
THAT'S IT'S CUSTOM CUSTOMISABLE AND
YEAH ME TOO
MM YEAH
YEAH
CAN I UH DO MY THING
IT UH
EXPERT MAP
OKAY UH
LAST WEEK
I WENT TO UH PARIS AND MILAN FOR SOME TREND WATCHING
FOR MARKETING
OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND I WENT TO PARIS AND MILAN
IN PARIS AND MILAN WE UH ASKED DIFFERENT PEOPLE UH DIFFERING IN AGE AND IN INCOME
UH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO SPEND UM WHAT THEY LIKE IN DESIGN UH AND MATERIAL NOWADAYS
FINDINGS
OUR MAIN AUDIENCE UH SO THAT'S PEOPLE BELOW FORTY UH PREFER THE FOLLOWING
AT FIRST THE COLOURS OF FRUIT
VERY BASIC COLOURS LIKE JANUS EXPLAINED
UM FRESH COLOURS UH GREEN RED UH STRAWBERRY RED UH YELLOW BANANA YELLOW
UM CONSIDERING MATERIAL UM
YEAH
THEY LIKE SPONGY MATERIAL LIKE YEAH A SPONGE BALL
LIKE A S SOFT MATERIAL
JANUS M UH MENTIONED IT ALSO
I THINK HE DID SOME UH
SOME FINDINGS HIMSELF
YOU WER YOU WEREN'T IN PARIS
OKAY
LIKE THIS
LIKE BIG UH G FLASHY COLOURS
FRESH
IT'S NICE I THINK
OKAY OUR SECONDARY AUDIENCE UH PEOPLE ABOVE FORTY A FORTY YEARS IN AGE THEY LIKE THE DARK TRADITIONAL COLOURS
UH
YEAH UH MATERIALS LIKE WOOD THAT
NO N J JUST J JUST A W
NO OKAY BUT JUST JUST A WOODEN UH LOOK
LIKE UH YOU HAVE THOSE FAKE UH FAKE PANELS ON THE FLOOR
THE THAT ISN'T WOOD ANYWAY BUT OKAY
BUT THAT'S OUR SECONDARY AUDIENCE
SO UH WE DECIDED TO TAKE
MM YEAH THE PEOPLE BELOW FORTY
SO THAT THIS DOESN'T APPLY
'KAY THE THIRD
UH THERE'RE SOME OVERALL THOUGHTS ABOUT NEW REMOTE CONTROLS
THEY HAVE TO LOOK FANCY
UM THEY SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGICAL IN INNOVATIVE
THAT MEANS UH THERE HAVE TO BE FANCY THINGS IN
UH AND EASY TO USE
BUT THAT'S COMMON
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
WE HAVE TO AIM AT A MU AT THE MAIN AUDIENCE
AND UH THEREFORE USE FRESH COLOURS
UH I'LL I'LL COME TO THAT IN A SECOND POINT
HERE THINK ABOUT REMOVABLE COVERS AS SEEN IN MOBILE TELEPHON TELEPHONE MARKET
TO CUSTOMISE YOUR OWN REMOTE CONTROL
LIKE THE NOKIA UH THE REMOVABLE COVERS UH JUST PUT A RED ON IT AND GO TO THE SHOP AND BUY A GREEN ONE
UH A THIRD MATERIAL BEING USED UH COULD WELL BE STUFF LIKE RUBBER
UM TWO ADVANTAGES
UH IT FITS WITHIN THE CURRENT MARKET TRENDS
AND UH IT ADDS SAFETY TO YOUR REMOTE UH WHEN YOU DROP IT
SO
UH TO COME BACK TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK UH AND THE PEOPLE IN MILAN AND PARIS ALSO THINK THAT UH THE RUBBER SHOULD BE PRETTY HARD
LIKE UH
SEEN ON REGULAR MOBILE PHONES
ACTUALLY THEY HAVE A LOT IN COMMON
THE PHONES AND THE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH EXACTLY
UH IN MY SECOND SHEET OF PERSONAL PREFERENCES UH WE HAVE TO RECONSIDER THE SPEECH FUNCTION UH RECOGNITION
UH IT'S VERY INNOVATIVE
INNOVATIVE
YEAH LIKE SOMETHING
YOU YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MARKET IS JUST SCREAMING FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE SPEAK UH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND STUFF
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP THE COST IN UH IN MIND BUT IT
YEAH IT IT CAN BE UH VERY EXPENSIVE
'KAY SECOND
UH BUILDING GAMES LIKE SNAKE OR TETRIS TO AMUSE THE YOUNGER USERS
UH ALSO THE LINK WITH UH MOBILE PHONES
UH
NO BUT NO OKAY
BUT YOU DON'T USE GAMES WHEN YOU'RE D WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A TELEPHONE CALL
IT'S JUST THE SAME
YEAH
WHEN YOU'RE AT COLLEGE
UH NO
YOU AL YOU ALSO TAKE UH T YOU TAKE YOUR IPAC AND GO UH PLAY GAMES
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I DO THAT BUT OKAY AND UM
AND THIRD I STICK WITH IT THE LOG IN FUNCTIONALITY UH WITH THE SLOGAN TAKE PARENTAL CONTROL TO A NEW DIMENSION
THAT'S IT
YEAH
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A BACK AND FORTH COME UP UH BUTTON
L LIKE IN UH INTERNET EXPLORER
YEAH OKAY BUT DOES IT THAT IS FOR UH GOING FROM FOUR TO FIVE
BUT IF YOU GO FROM TWO TO EIGHT AND YOU WANT
YEAH AND ON TWO
THAT YOU CAN SWITCH SWITCH EASY
YEAH IT IS
YEAH
MM NO
THAT'S IT
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH BUT
WHAT I SEE UH HOW I SEE IT IS YOU PUT IT ON THE THE REMOTE AND THEN YOU HAVE LIKE A WINDOWS LOG ON SCREEN WITH PARENTS CHILDREN
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND W WHEN YOU WANT TO USE THE PARENTS UH OPTION YOU HAVE TO
YEAH OK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
PU PUSH PARENTS
THAT THEN THEN THEN YOU HAVE TO UH GO TO THREE DIGIT UH LOG IN
LIKE TWO ONE THREE
AND IT'S IN
IT AUTOMATICALLY GOES YEAH
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
V VIOLENT T. V.
YEAH OF COURSE
YEAH
YEAH W IT JUST HAS TO BE W WHEN IT'S DELIVER OUT OF THE STORE IT HAS TO BE JUST SIMPLE AND PLAIN
BUT IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL IT PERSONALLY UH
IF I GOT KIDS AND I COULD CHOOSE BETWEEN UH TWO REMOTE CONTROLS
ONE UH W WITH PARENT CONTROL AND ONE WITHOUT AND I WOULD WOULD BUY THE ONE WITH
I TH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT YEAH BUT THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
YEAH AND
AND AND YOU KNOW W UH WHEN YOU INSTALL ANOTHER DEVICE
UH CHILDREN CAN STILL GO UP TO THE T. V. P POP OPEN UH THE THING AND AND AND G
GO TO A CHANNEL
YEAH YEAH OF COURSE
BUT
YEAH
AH IT'S YEAH
YEAH OKAY
BUT IT'S JUST AN AN ADDED FEATURE FEATURE
MM YEAH
YEAH LIKE F VOICE RECOGNITION IS TOO MUCH I THINK
BUT GAMES
IT DOESN'T
YEAH
THAT THAT DOESN'T C THAT DOESN'T CO
YEAH THAT THAT DOESN'T COST A LOT OF EXTRA RESOURCES I THINK
YEAH IT'S IT'S IN IT
BUT TOO MA I I THINK SO BUT
YEAH
TO PUT YEAH TO PUT IT IN ALWAYS
YEAH BUT T. V. S AREN'T CAPABLE OF SENDING
YEAH
I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST
A ABLE TO RECEIVE
YEAH SOME
BUT
YEAH
YEAH J JUST SOME RULES
YEAH OKAY
BUT ON THE T. V.
AT LEAST MY T. V. IS A IS A COMPARTMENT WHICH YOU CAN PRESS
AND THERE ARE BUTTONS UH BEHIND IT WHICH YOU CAN USE IF YOU D IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T HAVE A
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH OF COURSE
YEAH
OR J YEAH
AH I HAVE TO UH CONSULT MY LEGAL ADVISOR ABOUT IT
CONSENSUS
OH
OH
I I HAVE ONE THING LEFT
MAYBE FOR UH JEROME
UM THE VIEWS
MAYBE IT'S UH HANDY TO BUILD IN AN EXPERT VIEW AND A SIMPLE VIEW
YEAH
LIKE AT IN THE EXPERTS VIEW YOU HAVE A LOT OF MORE BUTTONS
YEAH
MM YEAH OKAY
FAIRLY ENOUGH
YEAH
YEAH WH WHICH BUTTONS YOU LIKE OR NOT
YEAH
YEAH
JUST LEAVE THE OTHER NUMBERS AWAY
OKAY
GO ON
A LITTLE CHAT
MARKETING
MANAGEMENT
YEAH THAT'S MY FUNCTION TO OKAY
GO ON
HOW I KNOW A MARKETING NAME FOR OUR PRODUCT
R. TH R. TO THE THIRD POWER
R. THREE
REAL REACTION REMOTE
MM-HMM
BLING
YEAH
YEAH OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE LIKE A SPLIT SECOND BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUT IN A CODE ALSO AND
YEAH
YEAH
THAT SPINS AROUND LIKE ALL THE TIME
IT IT'S JUST LIKE A UH GLOBE IN INTERNET EXPLORER
OKAY
WHO UH
WHO WHO GAVE YOU THE MASTER CLASS
RONALD BETENBERG
OKAY THANKS
AH
IN THE MASTER CLASS
YEAH
ME TOO
THANK YOU TOO LORD
'KAY GUYS LOT OF SUCCESS
WOULDN'T WANNA BE PROJECT MANAGER
UH WHAT WE GOING TO DO
UM ONCE AGAIN I'M UH GONNA TAKE MINUTES
SO UM NO PRESENTATION FOR ME
UH FIRST WE HAVE A PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION BY G. AND G.
AFTERWARDS SOME UH
EVAL EVAL EVALU EVALUATION S SORRY
UH EVALUATION CRIT CRITERIA
UH IN COMBINATION WITH THE FINANCE I UM UH I RECEIVED UH A AN UH AN EXCEL UH FILE
WHICH WE HAVE TO FILL IN LATER ON
UM YOU SEE
UH AND THEN WE MUST SEE UH IF WE UH STAY UNDER THE TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
SO THAT'S UH THAT'S A BIG L SO LET'S UH WAIT IT UH UM WE HAVE WE HAVE MUST UH
WE MUST HAVE UH SOME TIME FOR THAT UH BECAUSE IT WILL BE UH YEAH QUITE A LOT OF MATHEMATICS
AND AFTER THAT UH UH AN EVALUATION OF UH THE PROCESS HOW WE UH HOW WE HAVE DONE IT HERE WITH THE SMARTBOARD
WITH THE WITH OUR LAPTOPS WITH THE ALL UH ALL THIS
AND UH AFTERWARDS UH WE CLOSING
ONCE AGAIN FORTY MINUTES SO UH LET'S START
I WOULD G GIVE THE WORD TO UM G. AND G. FOR THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
J. AND J.
MM
NO OKAY
IT'S CALLED A WEEMOTE
WEEMOTE
YEAH I CAN IMAGINE THAT
YEAH BUT UH YOU D YOU MUSTN'T FORGET THAT UH OUR TARGET AIM IS YOUNGER PEOPLE
UH WE HAD DECIDED TO UH PUT UH SOME FLASHY FRUITY COLOURS IN IT
UH AND UH IN THE SURVEY FROM UH MILAN AND PARIS UH IT UH IT CAME OUT THAT UH UH THE D THE OLDER PEOPLE ARE UH MORE WILLING TO UH TO SPEND MONEY ON EXTRA FEATURES
SO I THINK UH IT WILL BE A BETTER IDEA TO HAVE SOME UH FLASHY FRUITY COLOURS AS AS A STANDARD
AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO UH REALLY WANT UH A MORE SOPHISTICATED MORE TRADITIONAL LOOK THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY UH THAT
THEY WANT UH THEY WANT MORE LUXURY STUFF BUT THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT AND THEY WANT TO B TO BUY THAT
SO MAYBE IT'S AN IDEA TO PUT THAT AS AN EXTRA AND NOT AS A STANDARD
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT THE MAI I THINK TH UH THE STANDARD MUST BE SOME KIND OF UH UH ATTRACTIVE FLASHY COLOURS
NOT TOO BUT W A LITTLE BECAUSE THAT'S OUR AIM
YEAH
WELL THE BUTTONS DON'T HAVE TO BE UH ALL UH ALL OF YEAH
IT
YEAH
OKAY
THANK YOU
THE MARKETING EXPERT
SORRY
OKAY SO WE GON WE GONNA EVALUATE THE
YEAH THE THE THING WE SAW
OKAY JUST SAW
YEAH
SEVEN
UH TRUE
SORRY
YEAH ONE I THINK
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YES
NO TELETEXT BUTTONS
TELETEXT IS IN THE MENU
VOLUME IS TRUE
YEAH BIG AND CLEAR
OH OKAY
WELL I AGREE
I WAS THINKING VERY BLACK AND WHITE
THANK YOU J.
FRUITY
YEAH
WELL WE P WE CAN DO IT GLOW IN THE DARK
SO IF IT'S IN THE DARK PLACE YOU STILL SEE IT GLOWING
I THINK AH YOU MUST SEE IT AS
UH W UH ACCORDING TO UH THE THE OTHER UH REMOTE CONTROLS
THERE MAY UH UH BE THERE IN YOUR UH T. V. ROOM THIS ONE WILL STAND OUT I THINK
EXA I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT
IF IT IF THIS LYING ON YOUR COUCH YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU THINK WHAT'S THAT FOR KINDA ORANGE UH THING
SO
YEAH
OKAY
THAT'S OUR REMOTE CONTROL
TRUE
YEAH BUT NOT TOO SOFT WE HAVE DECIDED
THREE YEAH
EASY TO USE
ONE
YEAH CAN IT BE ZERO
YEAH
OKAY TWO
YEAH TWO
WHAT'S THE TIME
WE ALSO HAVE UH TO DO THE EVALUATION UH THE PRODUCTION COSTS AND UH STUFF
YEAH
YOU'RE AGREE TIM
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A MORE INNOVATIVE UH THING IN UH PARIS
FALSE
YEAH BUT THEY ARE BUILT IN SO IT'S ONE
OKAY
FREAK
OKAY THANK YOU
WE'LL SEE
MM
OKAY WE HAVE NOW TO C UH TO CALCULATE THE PRODUCTION COST
IF IT'S UNDER UH TWELVE AND HALF EURO THEN IT'S UH OK UH OKAY
BUT I IS IT IF IT IS B HUH
NO THIS ISN'T RIGHT
OKAY SO
REDESIGN
OH YEAH IF THEY UNDER YEAH
NO
OH YEAH
YEAH IT'S SORRY
YEAH IF THE COSTS ARE UNDER TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
UH THEN WE UH CAN UH RA UH MOVE ON TO THE PROJECT EVALUATION AS WE HAVE UH EXPERIENCED IT
OTHERWISE WE HAVE UH DO UH HAVE TO DO A LITTLE UH REDESIGN UH THINGY
SO
UH WE HAVE TO FILL IN THE NUMBERS OF THE COMPONENT UH COMPONENTS
WE HAVE TO UH FIL UH WANT TO UH DO IT IN AND UH SEE UH IF WE STAY UNDER THE TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
SO DO WE HAVE UH A HAND DYNAMO
NO
THAT'S ZERO
BATTERY ONE
OKAY
KINETIC ONE
OKAY SOLAR CELLS ZERO
OKAY UH SIMPLE CHIP ON PRINT
NO
NO ADVANCED CHIP
SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER
THREE
YEAH UH BUT IT IT'S ONE ONE THING IT'S THREE EURO
UH WHAT'S THE SAMPLE SENSOR
OKAY
ZERO
UH UNCURVED FLAT
NO
BUT IS IT S IT'S NOT MADE FROM A SINGLE UNCURVED THINGY AND THEN UH AND THEN UH NO
OKAY
SO IT'S ONLY UH ONCE DOUBLE CURVED
OKAY
WE'RE NOW IN A PROBLEM 'CAUSE UH WE HAVE UH REACHED ELEVEN EURO YET
OKAY BUT UH WE HAVE
OKAY
UH RUBBER
YOU
TITANIUM NO
SPECIAL COLOUR
YEAH BUT WE WANT TO MAKE UH THE WOOD COLOURS UH THAT UH
YEAH ONE
YEAH BUT WE WE GOING TO YEAH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S IT
OKAY THE PUSH BUTTON NO
SCROLL WHEEL NO
NO
OH NO
YES ONE
UH BUTTON NO
NO THE THE WE DON'T HAVE A S NO
OKAY
OH OKAY
SO UM WHAT'S THE THING WE CAN CHANGE
UH CAN I UH I SAY SOMETHING
NO CAN I SAY SOMETHING UH AS PROJECT MANAGER
THE KINETIC THING CAN WE JUST SKIP IT BECAUSE UH YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY INNOVATIVE
YEAH
YO
SORRY YEAH YES
YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH AND NOT REALLY
BUT WE IF YOU FORGET ABOUT THE KINETIC WELL IF WE DO THAT
WE SHALL
SO UM
UH B BUT I BUT THE SINGLE CURVED IS JUST OH
OH OKAY OKAY
SO THAT'S WH THA THAT'S ONE OPTION
AND THEN W YEAH AND THEN WE COULD HAVE IT
BUT UH IT'S ITS' WELL IT'S IT'S R IT IS THE MAIN POINT OF THE THE THE THE LOOK
NO THO UH THAT THAT CAN BE DONE
SO UH
OKAY A LITTLE LESS UH CONVERSATION
SORRY
FILL IN JUST A
EXPLANATION
I CAN DELETE IT FOR YOU IF YOU WANT
SO IF WE DO THIS UH WE'RE ON UH TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
AND WE'RE DONE
UH WELL THE ONLY UH THING THAT DON'T
YEAH SINGLE CURVED BUT THERE'S A CURVE IN IT
SO
YEAH IT'S REALLY A STATIC VALUE
YEAH
YEAH IT IS
OH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
DO YOU THINK
WELL NOW YOU CAN SHAKE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
KINETIC
YEAH
WHO BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO GO TO KINETIC YOU'RE UH YOU'RE ON THIRTEEN AND A HALF AND YOU MUST GO TO FLAT
AND I THINK NOW IT'S IT'S MORE OF UH A COMPROMISE
THING
AND IF YOU MAKE THE SINGLE CURVE HA JUST A BIG CURVE
THEN IT'S UH THEN IT'S UH YEAH ONE BIG GOOD CURVE
I WAS GOING TO UH SAY NASTY WORDS BUT I DON'T
THIS IS STRANGE BY THE WAY
WOOD IS M IS IS IS CHEAPER THAN RUBBER
WE THOUGHT THAT WOOD WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE
YEAH MAYBE
BUT UH THAT THIS IS THIS IS IT
YEAH
OKAY THIS IS IT
I'M GONNA SAVE IT
YEAH
OKAY WELL
CONSIDERING WE HAVE
WELL WE WERE ABOVE SO WE DID A LITTLE REDESIGN
OKAY UM NOW UH IT'S ABOUT TIME TO UH TALK ABOUT UH THIS PROJECT
UH SOME UH THINGS
WERE THERE UH ROOM FOR UH WAS THERE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY IN OUR MEETINGS OR IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
I AGREE WITH THAT
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
OKAY
UH HOW ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
NOW WE'RE DONE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I NOTICE IT TOO
I WAS A I WAS ALSO VERY UH UNHAPPY UH VERY UNSATISFIED UH ABOUT THE
ABOUT THE FIRST MEETING
SO UH I HOPE UH UH THE THE THE OTHER MEETINGS UH
GET BETTER AND UH I THINK THE THE LAST TWO MEETINGS UH ALSO WE WE REACHED UH SOME GOOD DECISIONS ABOUT UH TALK YEAH
OKAY SO UH THAT'S COOL
UH TEAMWORK
WELL MAYBE THAT'S UH ONLY YEAH WELL IT'S FOR US BECAUSE UH
YEAH
YEAH AND IT'S WO MORE LIKE PRESENTATION AND SOME POINTS WERE DISCUSSED
BUT REALLY TEAMWORK WERE YOU TWO UH
THE
YEAH
NO HARD FEELINGS
YEAH
NOW YOU YOU MUST PUSH A LITTLE WHILE
OKAY
O JUST UH OKAY
YOU CAN BE YOU CAN GO QUICKER 'CAUSE THEN IT IT WON'T NOTICE IT
I FOLLOW THE MASTER CLASS FOR THE SMARTBOARD SO I THINK THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MAIN ISSUE
UM SO UH ABOUT THIS ONE YOU WERE UH YOU'RE DEALING WITH UM THE THE THE THE DIGITAL PEN
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
NO
HUH
WELL
YEAH
M YEAH
YEAH
AND IT IS STILL YOUR OWN HANDWRITING UH POPPING UP IN UH WORD
NO UH THAT'S TRUE
NO
AND UH THE SMARTBOARD IS UH USEFUL BUT THE THE PEN IS I UH NOT USER FRIENDLY I THINK
BE IT IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO DRAW THINGS AND TO WRITE THINGS AND THAT'S THE
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT TH THE THE YOU WHEN YOU AT A FOREIGN AUDIENCE YOU B DON'T GONNA WR UH WRITE UH SMALL
YEAH
BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOME FUNCTION WITH NO IT ISN'T
WITH UH
YEAH
WELL I'M GONNA ERASE MY UH NAME
YEAH IT'S A BIG UH BIG ERASER
UM
WELL THE THE IDEA OF THE TOUCH SCREEN IS UH
I'M JUST UH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT I MEAN
NO
OH
OH YEAH
THAT'S INTERESTING
OKAY BECAUSE WHAT DOES IT MEAN
ALL THE MO YEAH ARE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO
YEAH
OH OKAY
YEAH OKAY
THANK YOU EXPERT
BUT THE NEW IDEAS FOUND FOR UH WI WITH WORKING WITH THIS UH SOFTWARE
NOT REALLY YEAH
YEAH I THINK
YEAH
YEAH
YOU HAD EXPECTED IT TO TO BE UH MORE MORE UH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEP YEP
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH AND AND MAYBE SOME UH FUNCTIONS FOR UH UH UH CIRCLE OR UH A SQUARE
YOU HAVE TO DRAW IT YOURSELF NOW
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT THAT CAN BE DONE ALREADY
BUT NOT THE THE THE THE PREDEFINED UH SQUARES I THINK UH
HMM
SORRY
WELL THAT'S NICE
IS IT
HERE
OH
OH SORRY
SELECT
YEAH
HERE THAT
SO YOU HAVE AS YOU SAW YOU HAVE A LITTLE UH
OH YOU CAN
YEAH THANK YOU
YOU CAN GO UH
THERE
SO THERE THE THE THE FUNCTIONALITY IS THERE BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IDEAL AND IT'S IT'S VERY IT COSTS A LOT OF TIME TO UH
TO USE
AND THAT'S A PITY IF YOU UH IF YOU HAVE UH THIRTY FORTY MINUTES UH FOR THIS KIND OF THINGS
AND WE ARE NOW WITH FOUR PEOPLE BUT IT WELL IMAGINE YOU ARE HERE YOU'RE WITH THE TEN PEOPLE AND EVERYONE UH
YEAH
TWO MINUTES OF DRAWING YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH JUST LIKE HE SAID WITH THE WITH THE A SCREEN WHICH YOU CAN WRITE ALSO UH A KIND OF VOTING UH MECHANISM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY SO
UH WELL JUST ABOUT BECAUSE UH
YEAH TOMORROW
UH THE COSTS ARE WITHIN THE BUDGET
UH THE PROJECT IS EVALUATED
BUT BEFORE WE GOING TO CELEBRATE UH I HAVE UH A LITTLE QUESTION WHICH YOU CAN'T ANSWER BECAUSE UH THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF END REPORT
I AM BUSY WITH THE END REPORT RIGHT NOW
YOU MIGHT THINKING WHAT THE HELL WAS HE DOING UH
UH ABOUT ALL THE MEETINGS WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED A R R A REPORT OF THIS DAY
UH THAT MUST BE MADE BUT I DON'T KNOW HERE IS UH STANDING UH WHOA WE CAN CELEBRATE NOW BUT THE END REPORT IS
OKAY WELL THAT UH THAT CAN BE DONE
MAYBE WE CAN DO IT UH TOGETHER
YOU CAN SEE WHAT I'VE UH YEAH
SO I I S I WILL UH PUT IT ON A STORY BOARD
YOU CAN SEE IT
BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL UH IT MUST BE UH
YEAH IT'S A THREE UH WITH SEVENTY FIVE UH
YEAH JUST ABOUT
WELL JUST A MOMENT
END REPORT
NO NO NO I'M JUST UH YOU CAN S YOU CAN READ IT AND UH HERE HERE IT IS
END REPORT
WELL THIS NOT NIT IT READ ONLY
BUT IT'S NOT UH FULLY FINISHED YET
UM THIS IS ABOUT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THE THINGS YEAH YEAH
OH YEAH
I'M UH WHEN I SAID IT I REMEMBER I HAD IT HERE
MARKETING EXPERT OKAY
UM
ABOUT THE THREE FUNCTIONS WHERE UH WHICH ARE MOST USED AND UH WHICH MUST UH IMMEDIATELY BE VISIBLE ON OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL
UM IT MUST BE UH SIMPLE TO USE VERY CLEAR WHAT TO DO AND AT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE
SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WH UH WHAT KIND THINGS UH MUST BE IN IT AND UH YEAH
YEAH I UNDERSTAND YOU I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT DUTCH
OKA OKAY OKAY I
I REALLY DIDN'T KNEW THAT
SO THIS ONE'S FIRST
YOU GO THERE AND YOU GO THERE
SO OKAY
WELL MAYBE I CAN THEN DO IT ONE TWO THREE
IF THE ORDER IS IN UH IS IS UH IMPORTANT THAT'S THE WORD FOR
UH
THEN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
UH WELL ALL THE THINGS WE HAVE UH DISCUSSED UH THE ENERGY WHICH UH TURN OUT TO BE UH BATTERIES SO THAT'S
YEAH BECAUSE YEAH
UH HE HERE IT IS STILL DOUBLE CURVE THE RUBBER THE FLASHY THE FRUITY THE REMOVABLE
UH THE BUTTONS HMM
NOT DOUBLE ANYMORE
NAY BUT THAT THIS IS WHAT UM
YEAH
AND THE THE ADDED FUNCTIONS LIKE TETRIS SNAKE IT'S UNDER THE PARENTAL CONTROL THE TOUCH SCREEN
SO IT'S UH JUST A SUMMARY OF WHAT UH WE HAD DISCUSSED UH
UH IT'S VERY CHEAP YOU YOU MAYBE YOU YOU YOU YOU COME AT UH
IT'S VERY NECESSARY
YEAH BUT IT STILL HAS SOME YEAH
OKAY BUT SO WE CAN DISCUSS THAT UH
WE CAN DISCUSS THAT KIND OF THINGS I THINK WITH THE
WITH THE THE BOARD OF UH
WHAT'S IT WHAT'S THE COMPANY CALLED
I JUST KEEP FORGETTING IT
REAL REAL REACTION
REAL REACTION YEAH
OKAY SO UH ANYBODY UH MISSES SOMETHING HERE ABOUT UH
YEAH OKAY THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA WRITE B BETWEEN NOW
BUT I IN HERE NOTHING UH
MM-HMM
YES
YEAH TOUCH SCREEN I'VE MENTIONED
YEAH OKAY WELL I GONNA REDESIGN UH SOMETHING NOW
NO
BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL OH FIVE MINUTES FROM TO FINISH MEETING
OH THAT'S COOL TIM
FINISH MEETING NOW
WELL I'M I'M
I'M GOING TO FINISH MY END REPORT
I AM THE ONE WHO CAN SAY THAT
YEAH
HEREBY THE MEETING IS FINISHED
YEAH
YO
EVALUATION CRITERIA
OOPS
SOME CREATIVE UH
OH
YEAH
OK OKAY
SHALL I GIVE A SHORT INTRODUCTION AND THEN UH
OKAY
J. AND J. OKAY
TAKE IT AWAY
UM THIS WAS OUR FIRST CONCEPT
WE DECIDED TO USE A SINGLE TOUCH SCREEN
SO WE'VE WORKED OUT THIS CONCEPTS HOW TO HOW TO HOLD IT WHERE TO PUT THE BUTTONS AND AND STUFF
AND UM WELL WE BEGAN WITH UH WITH A FORM OF SHAPE
THAT IS UH IS EASY TO HOLD W IN ONE HAND LEFT OR RIGHT HANDED
SO WE MADE I IT A LITTLE BIT LESS THICK AND UH IT HAS SOME AR ARTISTIC MEANING
NO
THIS UH ISN'T NOTHING
IDEA MAYBE UH IS BETTER
UM WELL DURING THE MEETING I SHOWED YOU THE CONCEPT OF UH PLACING THE BUTTONS ON TOP USABLE WITH YOUR THUMB
AND UH THE MENU STRUCTURE UH IF NECESSARY WITH YOUR OTHER HAND SO IT'S JUST GONNA HOLD IT EASILY
AND IT HAS TO BE ACCE ACCESSIBLE WITH YOUR UH OTHER HAND TOO OF COURSE
SO WE BEGAN UH WORKING OUT A CONCEPT
YEAH THE PANEL JUST UH OF COURSE GOES LIKE THIS
BUT THE OVERLAYING LAYER IS UH A LITTLE BIT UH CURVED AND STUFF
YEAH
YEAH
OH WE ADDED THAT THIS UM CAN BE HELD WITH YOUR HANDS FOR THIS MAXIMUM IS OM YEAH ONE AND A HALF CENTIMETRES
SO YOU HAVE ROOM HERE FOR YOUR BATTERY AND MAYBE EVEN OTHER UM ELECTRONIC CHIPS
S AND YOU CAN JUST BE THE THE LAYER OF THE TOUCHSCREEN AND SOME HAVE SOME WIRES UNDERNEATH IT TO MAKE IT AS UH THIN AS POSSIBLE IN THE MIDDLE FOR GOOD GRIP
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IT WOULD BE BEST TO TO APPEAL TO A BROAD PUBLIC AND MAKE THE COVERS EXCHANGEABLE
SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BUY AN ORANGE AND A RED AND BLUE AND A PURPLE
BUT WHEN THE O OLDER PEOPLE UH GO IN THE SHOP AND THEY SEE UH AN ORANGE UM REMOTE CONTROL IT WOULD BE LESS APPEALING THAN A WHITE ONE
AND YOUNG PEOPLE WE THINK ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE THEY THINK AH I'LL BUY FOR A COUPLE OF EUROS SOME NOI NICE HIP UH
WELL
UM I THINK A COVER IS NECESSARY 'CAUSE ALS OTHERWISE YOU'LL JUST HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
SO THERE MUST BE SOME CHEAP STANDARD COVER UM MAYBE WHITE OR SOMETHING
THAT'S COULD COMES WITH IT AND YOU CAN BUY SO WE CAN MAKE EXTRA MONEY
OKAY
THE OTHER WAY AROUND YOU MEAN
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY YEAH
WELL YEAH A COLOUR OF A WOOD STYLE A WHITE C AND UH A COUPLE OF H HIP UH FRUITY COLOURS
AND LEA UH L DELIVERED STANDARD WITH A FRUITY COLOUR BUT NOT TOO NOT TOO MUCH
THIS IS BANANA AND MANGO NOT NOT PURPLE OR P ORANGE AND YELLOW
AH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
NO
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
IT'S MY TURN
MM
YEAH
NO NO A LITTLE MORE IN THE MIDDLE
NO UH THREE OR YEAH
YEAH IT WILL BE PRIMARY APPEALING TO TO M MINUS FORTY BUT ALSO APPEALING TO
YEAH
IT'S WOW
YEAH IT'S THE MARKETING UH ANGLE ON TELEVISION
WE HAVE A WONDERFUL
YEAH
WELL IT'S ALSO FANCY THEN
YEAH
OF COURSE
WE HAVE A PERFECT REMOTE
YES
YEAH YEAH OH THEY HAVE TO AGREE BUT
I'M THE USER INTERFACE UH EXPERT
UM UH NO
YOU YOU'VE DIFFERENT MENU
AND VOLUME IS IMPO YEAH
YEAH YEAH BIG AND CLEAR
BUT YOU COULD MAKE A TELETEXT BUTTON UH SIX
OTHERWISE THE PEOPLE WHO READ THIS UH ARE GONNA THINK WE HAVE NO TELETEXT BUTTON
NO
YEAH
BLACK AND RED
OKAY DON'T FORGET TO SAVE IT
UH
UH WELL WHEN WE PUT IN FANCY COLOURS YEAH AND YEAH
BUT UM IT IT'S NOT MAKING ANY SOUND UH HAVE WE DECIDING
SO
IT'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE
WE HAVE THE BETTER RE I DON'T KNOW
YEAH I THINK SO
MY REMOTE CONTROL'S BLACK
A LITTLE BIT BUT YEAH
UH
K YEAH
FO FO YEAH FO FIVE IS
YEAH OKAY YOU'RE RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
IF YOUR UH FIFTEEN REMOTES IN A DRAWER UH YOU FIND IT YEAH
YEAH THAT'S STUPID
UH BUT WHEN YOU LOST IT YOU'RE JUST NOT
YEAH MOSTLY WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IT IT'S UNDER YOUR
MOST OF TIMES WHEN YOU LOSE IT YOU'RE SITTING ON IT
UH
UM I WOULD CALL UH CHOOSE TWO 'CAUSE WE DECIDED NOT TO MAKE TWO F UH FRESH COLOURS AS IT WOULD NOT
UM
KINDA SOFT BUT BUT NOT THIS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH EASY TO USE VERY AFFORD
NO YOU CAN DO TWO BECAUSE UM IT CAN BE EASIER
BUT THEN YOU'RE L YEAH BUT THEN YOU'LL LOSE FUNCTION F YEAH FUNCTIONALITY AND OUR FANCY UH LOOK SO
BUT
IT IS R IT IS RATHER EASY TO USE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE PRIMARY BUTTONS ALWAYS VISIBLE
NO
YEAH M MINE TOO
YEAH BUT WAITS JUST A MINUTES
INSPIRATION
THESE ARE THE M REGULAR REMOTES
YES TRUE ONE
YES ONE
VERY MULTIFUNCTIONAL
NO
THIS IS USED WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION THIS
YES
BUT UH MAYBE MAKE IT TWO BECAUSE THE GAMES ARE IN A SUB MENU AND NOT UH IT'S NOT AN ENTIRE GAME
YEAH OKAY
YES
TH DID YOU MAKE THIS OR THE
YEAH
IT CHANGES IT MAYBE
OH YAY
OH DEAR
HMM
IF THEY'RE UNDER TWELVE FIFTY
YEAH
CAU 'CAUSE SO IT'S OKAY
BATTERY YES
ONE
ONE YEAH
KINETIC ONE
YEAH
NO
NO THE ADVANCED CHIP IS UH
YEAH
YEAH YOU GIVE IT A SAMPLE UH ONE
NO
YOU NO
YEAH 'CAUSE UM THE LAYER AROUND IT FITS AROUND THE BUBBLES ON THE O ON THE UH THE BACK OF THE
UH WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
SO
COULD YOU STEP A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT MA YEAH
OH SORRY
OR
AND ZERO
SPECIAL UH IS THE SPECIAL COLOUR
MM
YEAH
YEAH IF IF YOU'RE HONEST WE'LL UH TYPE ONE SPECIAL COLOUR
YEAH
UH J MAYBE WE'LL FINISH UH THE THE LIST FIRST AND THEN LOOK BACK AYE
NO
SCROLL WHEEL NO
NO
ONE YEAH
NO
MM IS IT NO
NO
SO
NO
NO
MM SINGLE CURVES
YEAH
JUST CUT OFF THE KINE YEAH
OR YEAH
YEAH WE JUST PUT A GOOD BATTERY IT IT
MOBILE PHONES NOWADAYS
BUT YOU CAN USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES ANYWAY JUST YOU S YOU HAVE TO RECHARGE THEM MANUAL
YEAH THAT'S A COST REDUC
AH
YEAH SO WE HAVE TO BAKE THE BA BACK FLAT AND THEN
NO IT'S IT'S JUST ONE CURVE AND NOT A BACK UH CURVED I THINK
OR
OR ARE THESE TWO CURVES
UH
YEAH BUT WHAT ELSE UH DO WE HAVE TO CUT OUT
NO ADVANCED CHIP UH THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF PROBLEM
ALTHOUGH CAN WE MAKE IT WITH A REGULAR CHIP
CURVY
EXPLANATION
TWELVE FIFTY
WELL
YEAH BUT DOES IT FIT WITH OUR DESIGN
DO WE HAVE TO U ADAPT IT
IT'S SINGLE CURVES
W
COULD WE JUST MAKE THE BUBBLES UH CUT OFF THE BACK AND THEN WE'RE UH HAS
OKAY
MORE
YEAH
YOU MAKE IT OPTIONAL
FUNCTIONAL
UH THERE'S AN A A ATHE AESTHETIC VALUE BUT NOT FUNCTIONALITY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T FIT IN OUR CO COST PROFILE
SO
YOU MA CAN MAKE AN AN ESPECIALISED EXTRA GOLD VERSION
YEAH
YEAH JUST ONE BIG CURVE
UH THIS UH AMERICAN FIGURES
YOU JUST CUT DOWN SOME TREES
WHOEVER MAKES UH A REMOTE CONTROL OUT OF TITANIUM
YES
NO
WE SUE
WE YEAH WE'LL START HER ALL O ALL OVER AGAIN
UM
FOR US THERE WAS A LOT OF CREATIVITY
WE COULD JUST SIGN UP AN UH REMOTE IF WE LIKED
UH
CRAPPY
CRA
YEAH
YEAH EXAMPLE OF CRAPPY LEADERSHI
OKAY YEAH
YOU COULD OF SAID SHUT UP YOU FOOL
YEAH MORE MORE CONSENSUS
EV EVERYBODY W WAS AGREEING EVERY YEAH
WELL WE WORK TOGETHER ON A PROJECT BUT EVERYBODY HAS HIS OWN TASK
SO IT IS A LITTLE BIT
YEAH
NO
WELL IT WENT OKAY
STUPID STUPID PEN BUT UH
YEAH BUT BUT DRAW SOMETHING UH DIFFICULT
D UH JUST WRITE YOUR NAME RIGHT NOW
TRY TO WRITE YOUR NAME IN IN WRITING LETTERS OF COURSE YEAH
YEAH NORMALLY UH THIS UH THE W BLOCK LETTER SIGN IT YEAH
JUST JUST WRITE YOUR NAME IN IN ONE LINE
IF IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO SMALL BIT QUICKER NOW
IT DIDN'T
UH HE HE KNOWS HOW IT WORKS YEAH
Y WELL YEAH
TH THE I
THE IDEA IS GREAT BUT IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY
UH
YEAH
NEE
AS UH AS I SAID A M A C FEW MOMENTS AGO IT I WOULD LIKE MYSELF TO WRITE WITH A NORMAL PEN BECAUSE MUST UM
YEAH IT'S ALMOST THE SAME CONCEPT BUT YOU CAN JUST SIM MORE SIMPLY PUT IT ON OUR SCANNER
I IT'S THE SAME CONCEPT AS THE PEN WHERE YOU F HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE OR S UH VERY UH SLOW
YES
NO AND IT DOESN'T GIVE ANY ADDED VALUE
YEAH NOT USER FRIENDLY
YEAH AND IT'S IT'S NOT VERY PRECISE
WE'RE TRYING TO M TO
YEAH IT MAY UM YEAH AND TR TRY TO WRI WRITE YOUR NAME UH IN A IN A NORMAL UH SIZE YEAH
SMALLER
YEAH SMALLER
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU'RE WRITING ON A LETTER
NO A AS YOU SAW ON ON THIS DRAWING JUST OPEN OPEN THIS ONE OR THAT ONE
IT'S UH TH IT IT YEAH UH WE HAD MORE PROBLEMS EVEN HERE WHEN WE TRYING TO DRAW THESE BUTTONS
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET CLEAR UH WHEN YOU'RE UH
AND THE ERASER WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM
IT W T IS IS THIS LARGE
AND WHEN YOU TRY TO ERASE THIS LINE Y
I'M GONNA ERASE MY NAME THERE
M ABO WHAT KIND OF NEW IDEAS
YEAH UH
NEW IDEAS ABOUT UH THE WORKING OF THIS SOFTWARE ABOUT ABOUT THE PROJECT ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROLS OR
HELLO
YEAH
SO TRUE
NOT REALLY JUST THEY HAVE TO IMPROVE IT
UH THE CONCEPT IS OKAY BUT IT HAS TO BE QUICKER
UH IT IS STILL OPENING MY PROGRAMME
N ALMO ALMOST UH MY ENTIRE COMPUTER IS LOCKED UP DURING THE PROCESS AND IT YEAH JUST TAKES TOO MANY TIME
PEOPLE WILL STILL FEEL THE NEED TO TO WRITE IT QUICKLY ON UH A PAGE AND NOT DOWNLOAD IT AND SAVE IT AND
MORE USER FRIENDLY
'CAUSE WHEN YOU USE A PEN YOU CAN JUST DRAW LIKE YOU D DRAW NORMALLY AND YOU DO
YEAH
YEAH THAT L
WOULD BE EASIER
OR AT LEAST WHEN YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADAPT TO THE TECHNOLOGY JUST YOU CAN WRITE IN THE WAY YOU NORMALLY WRITE
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO UM KEEP CONSTANTLY IN MIND THAT YOU'RE DRAWING ON THIS SCREEN
AND THAT'S A VERY BAD CONCEPT
NAH OKAY I I IT'S MY OPINION THAT I
YEAH IT'S CAN BE SAVED EASIER
BUT IF YOU'RE IN NORMAL FLIP OVER YOU A LOT OF PEOPLE WRITE TEXT
THERE'S NO TEXT OPTION
AND WRITING TEXT UH YEAH YOU'VE GOTTA REALLY DO YOUR BEST TO WRITE SOME
YEAH
OR MAYBE EVEN INSERT PICTURE
IF YOU HAVE UH SOME PRESENTATION AND YOU HAVE SOME F
YEAH
'CAUSE THEN YOU COULD
OH OKAY
SO YOU CAN
WITH UH W. W. DOT GOOGLE DOT COM
OH YEAH
MAYBE
YOU'LL JUST MAKE A LINK IN
YEAH
THERE'S ONE WAY TO UH
MAYBE IF IF YOU'RE NOT USING THE ERASER
SOMETHING ELSE TH YEAH ARROW
OKAY
WELL IT'S
YEAH OKAY
BUT
TO USE YEAH
YEAH
AND THAT'S M
THAT'S MOSTLY THE CASE FROM THE OVER HERE WITH THE MANAGEMENTS YOU GET TWO MINUTES TO MAKE YOUR CASE AND IF YOU HAVE TO DO ALL THIS KIND
YOU'LL RATHER USE POWERPOINT AND WORK IT OUT IN ADVANCE
AND TH THE ONE OR TWO THINGS YOU HAVE TO DRAW WHEN YOU'RE THERE JUST USE A FLIP BOARD
YEAH
OKAY
YO MANAGER
WHEN ARE W
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO PRODUCE IT
OH
A CHAIRMAN
YES
IT'S A READ ONLY VERSION
OH OKAY
UH
ONE TWO THREE
YEAH
WELL OKAY MAYBE YOU CAN ADD IT LATER THAT WE DECIDED IN THE END BECAUSE OF THE COST
A SINGLE CURVED
AH IT'S VERY CHEAP
YEAH
HE'LL DO IT IN HIS FREE TIME
SO UH
OF DIRECTUR OR DIRECTORS
YEAH
YOU CAN ASK YOUR PERSONAL
YEAH THE END CONCLUSION
BUT UH
UM THE DECISION TO MAKE UM THE BUTTONS ON THE TOP AND THE MENU ON THE
ON THE BOTTOM
AND CLEARLY YEAH TOUCH SCREEN YOU'VE MENTIONED
OKAY
OKAY THIS N YEAH
PARTY PARTY
OH BEFORE YOU CHANGE ANYTHING MAYBE YOU UM SAVE IT FIRST
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN SELECT FILE AND EXPORT AND THEN THOSE J. PEG FILES
WELL EIGHT
AND WE HAVE UH ANOTHER BLANK ONE
DID WE CHANGE ANYTHING
WOW
YEAH
IT'S A NEW UH COMMERCIAL LOGO
DON'T SAVE IT AYE
UH
WHY ARE ONLY THE FIRST FIVE SMARTBOARD FILES
SAVED
EVALUATION
MM-HMM
THAT'S GONNA BE T PROBLEM
YEAH WELL SURE
HI
YEAH UH WELL AND AS YOU SAW WE WOULD JUST HAVE THE BASIC REMOTE WITH THE PANEL L. C. D. UH SCREEN
WELL THESE WOULD BE THE MAIN BUTTONS H YOU COULD UH CHANGE THEM LATER ON IN YOUR OWN PROFILE IF YOU WANT TO
BUT WELL IT'S STANDARD THEY WILL BE DELIVERED WITH THIS KIND OF UH SET UP
WE HAVE THE MORE ADVANCED MENU UH SETTING RIGHT HERE
WE HAVE THE SUB MENUS AND STU STUFF
WE MADE A TOP OH OR A FRONT VIEW
JUST SO LIKE YOU WANNA UH BACK VIEW
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS UH THERE THERE ARE UH TWO UH WEIRD BUMPS IN IT
THIS IS FOR UH THE ADDED UH EFFECT OF UH WELL UH Y YOUTH AND DYNAMIC
AND UH THIS IS FOR THE ARTISTIC EFFECT
WELL WHAT WE FIGURED IS UH WE'LL SHOW YOU A PICTURE LATER ON YOU HAVE MORE B A BETTER IDEA AFTER THAT
BUT IDEA IS FOR TO STAY IN BALANCE WITH THESE TWO UH WITH THESE TWO
AND SO WHEN YOU PUT IT ON THE TABLE IT WILL JUST LAY DOWN
IT WON'T UH ROLL AROUND OR STUFF
BUT IT WILL LIE MORE IN YOUR HAND LIKE AN OLD TELEPHONE MAYBE OR LIKE THESE OLD UH PHONES
Y YOU YOU MAY GET THE IDEA
SO THI THIS IS ABOUT UH HOW WE FIGURED IT SHOULD BE
THE S PANEL WE G YOU WOULD HIDE WITH SOME MORE UH RUBBER LAYERS LIKE WE DISCUSSED EARLY ON
UH YOU WOULD S YOU WOULDN'T SEE THE UH STRAIGHT PANEL BUT MORE FLUIDLY AND ROUND
YEAH
AND UH IN THESE BUMPS YOU COULD ACTUALLY UH PUT SOME ELECTRONICS UH THAT WOULD YOU CAN MAKE A MORE THINNER UH DESIGN
AND THAT WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK VERY NICE YEAH
AND UH ABOUT THE COLOUR WHAT HAVE
YEAH F UH AS COLOURS DO YOU DO YOU HAVE THE PICTURE IN UH
OH YEAH
NOW WELL THIS IS THE IDEA ABOUT UH THE BUMPS
UH YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A V A VERY UH YOUTHFUL UH DYNAMIC UH EXTERIOR
IT UH YOU JUST WANT TO HOLD IT YOU UH YOU ARE YOUNG AND UH DYNAMIC LIKE US
YEAH IT'S LIKE AN E BUT THIS IS FOR CHILDREN
WE WE WANT A MORE ADULT VERSION
BUT THIS IS LIKE A REMOTE CONTROL FOR CHILDREN
A WEEMOTE
YEAH
HEY THAT'S ACTUALLY A BRILLIANT UH MARKETING STAND
UH BUT SO THIS ACTUALLY BASIC THE IDEA
WE WE JUST WANT TO BUILD A MORE UH ADULT VERS ADULT VERSION OF OF THIS
AND AND FOR COLOURS WE WE FIGURED STARTING WITH BASIC COLOURS LIKE UH WHITE OR METALLIC GREY
THOSE ARE THE TECHNOLOGICAL COLOURS ACTUALLY SO IT D
OR BLUE OR WHATEVER
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE YEAH PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT
UH I I WOULD I WOULD ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THIS SOUNDS LOGICAL
NAH
YEAH
YEAH LI LIKE LIKE THIS LIKE THIS
THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T TOO MUCH IS IT
I F
YEAH
THE BUTTONS I
YEAH UH SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD BE NICE
OKAY THAT'S THAT'S IT FROM US
UH OH
WHY
YEAH IT'S NOT JUST UH DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY
IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE ABOVE FORTY
SO
I HAVE I'VE YEAH TWO OR THREE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST UH THE QU QUESTION IS AIMED AT IS IT DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH AGE BELOW FORTY
BUT IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE OF AGE ABOVE FORTY
SO
I'LL SAY IT'S ABOUT THREE
YEAH I I THINK
YEAH
YES
YES
YEAH
LEADS TO USER FACE YEAH
YEAH FALSE
UH HMM
YEAH THE THEY ARE BIG AND CLEAR
YEAH BUT BUT THE TELETEXT BUTTON
YEAH YOU CAN CH THAT'S IN A MENU
SO IT'S W YEAH IT IT IT IT ISN'T ENTIRELY UNCLEAR BUT SO I WOULDN'T GIVE IT A SEVEN
I WOULD GIVE IT A MORE A FIVE OR A SIX
UH I DON I DON'T KNOW
WHAT DO YOU THINK UH MISTER PROJECT MANAGER
HMM
YEAH
YEAH IT HAS THESE ALL THESE FRUITY COLOURS AND IT HAS A STRANGE SHAPE
SO IF YOU SO IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE FINDING IT
WELL THEN UH THEN I'LL GO FOR FOUR
BECAUSE UH FOUR IS BETWEEN THREE AND UH UH ALSO BETWEEN BETWEEN TRUE AND FALSE
UH
SO I'LL I'LL GO FOR FOUR
WHA
YEAH THAT THAT'S A BETTER QUESTION ACTUALLY
WELL IF I IF YOU SEE A STRANGE SHAPE LYING SOMEWHERE UH THEN YOU'D UH RECOGNISE IT AS WHOA THAT IS STRANGE
YEAH
YEAH WHAT IS THAT
UH
SO IT'S
YEAH
YEAH RUBBER IS KIND OF SOFT
WELL I DON YEAH IT IS KIND OF
IT
NO
UH
IT COULD YEAH
FUNCTIONAL ABILITY
NO IT'S IT I I'LL GO FOR TWO
MY VOTE'S ON TWO
YES
YES IT
YEAH THEY ARE BUILT IN
NOT DOWN
YOU REALLY LIKE THE PARENTAL ADVISORY
BU
YEAH HE MADE IT
NO
ME TOO
YES
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UH N NO
NO
YES
NO
UH WE HAVE ONE
WE HAVE ONE
NO SEV ZERO
WELL THAT'S UM YEAH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND S
A ZERO
NO
NO
YEAH
JUST GO ON
THEN WE'LL SEE UH WE'LL WE'LL SEE UH WHA HOW MUCH WE ARE OVER BUDGET
ZERO
I DON'T THINK SO
NO THIS IS A STANDARD COLOUR
YES THIS IS A SPECIAL COLOUR
THAT'S AN ADD ON
NO
THESE THREE
WELL WE'RE ONLY FOUR EURO OVER BUDGET
BUT
WELL OTHER CASE WE CAN MAKE IT SINGLE CURVED OR UNCURVED
YEAH
OKAY SURE
YEAH SURE
OKAY WELL YOU YOU CAN GO FROM DOUBLE CURVED TO SINGLE CURVED
AND THAT WOULD SOLVE THE BUDGET PROBLEM
YEAH
IT'S JUST YEAH WELL THE SINGLE CURVE THAT
YEAH
EXACTLY YEAH
WE GOING TO CUT
YEAH WE JUST MAKE IT FLAT
BUT YOU DO L
FUNCTION
WORTH DOES IT HAVE ADDED WORTH
NO UM
YEAH WELL LET'S ASSUME IT IS
WE WE SHOULD ASSUME IT I THAT IT IS
BUT I I FIGURED THAT THE KINETIC WOULD BE A MARKETING PROMOTION
R IF YOU UH PROMOTE A KINETIC UM I KINETIC REMOTE CONTROL I MEAN THAT WOULD B SELL BETTER THAN AN A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL
NO WELL Y I MEAN UH Y YOU CAN GO INTO YOUR NEIGHBOUR AND TELL HIM HA MY K UH REMOTE CONTROL IS KINETIC
YOU HAVE STANDARD OLD BATTERY CONTROL UH REMOTE CON
TRUE
IT IS POSSIBLE BUT YOU CAN'T USE DOUBLE UH CURVES FOR TITANIUM
THAT'S ONE OF THE FUNCTIONABILITY UH
WELL I TH I THINK YOU TWO UH ESPECIALLY YOU AND UH AND UH DANIEL
YOU D YOU YOU BOTH HAD UH THE LESS CREATIVE UH ROLES IN THE PROJECT
'CAUSE I THINK M
I THINK JEROEN AND I WE HAD A MORE DESIGN WE COULD HAVE MORE WE HAD MORE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY THAN THAN YOU TWO
HA
NAH THE LEADERSHIP WASN'T CRAPPY IT WAS THE LEADER THAT WAS CRAPPY
NAH
NO THE LEADERSHIP WAS OKAY
YEAH IT WAS GOOD
TRY TO LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKE
AND WE WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN
YEAH THAT WENT W IT WENT WELL
IT'S IT'S JUST UH
NAH
YEAH WE WE HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH THE PEN BUT
YEAH BUT US
YEAH
OH
NO I HAVE IT WORKING
BUT UH YEAH WELL UH
NO IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH ADDED VALUE TO THE
YEAH
KNOW WHAT I MEAN
OR TEXT FUNCTION
JUST T T TYPE TEXT AND THAT THAT WOULD BE UH EXCELLENT
MEAN
OH
BUT UH PROBLEM IS WELL YOU CAN'T DISCUSS ANYTHING WELL YOU YOU CA UH YOU CAN
BUT YOU WILL DISCUSS A LOT LESS THAN L LIKE WE DID NOW
WE I MEAN UH W W W ONE ONE PERSON S MAYBE SAID THREE
BUT WELL UH I WE SAID UH NO I W TH THINK TWO BECAUSE THIS AND THIS AND THEN YOU CAN REACT UH ON IT
BUT IF YOU YOU PUT A THREE ON IT UH JUST FIGURE WELL EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT I'M KNOWING SO THEY'LL ALL JUST PUT A TWO ON
YEAH BUT IT WOULD YEAH
YEAH OKAY THE FOR PROCESSING PART
BUT THEN UH I THINK THE IDEA OF ONE PERSON ENTERING IT AND THE REST UH DISCUSSING IT THAT UH ISN'T THAT BAD IDEA ACTUALLY
NOT THAT YOUR OPINION ISN'T VALUED BUT BUT STILL
YEAH SURE
Y YIKES
SEVENTY FIVE PAGES
SO YOU YOU FINISHED IT ACTUALLY AND SO WE JUST HAVE TO READ IT AND SAY YES OR NO
IT'S NOT DOUBLE
UH IT'S NOT DOUBLE ANYMORE EH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
ON THING UH
ONE SMALL THING UH THE ADDED FUNCTIONS
UH WAS IT INCLUDED IN THE COST

DURING THE
OH
DURING THE DESIGN UH DESIGN LIFE CYCLE WE UH
WE MADE LOT OF REQUIREMENTS AND TREND ANALYSIS AND STUFF
UM NOW IS THE TIME TO UH EVALUATE OUR PROTOTYPE CONCEPT TO UH
TO THE PAST REQUIREMENTS
SO WE ARE GOING TO EVALUATE THE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THE PAST USER REQUIREMENTS AND TRENDS ANALYSIS
UM WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT WITH A SEVEN POINT SCALE
OPENING A WORD DOCUMENT NOW
OKAY
ONE OH OKAY UH I HAVE TO EXPLA EXPLAIN SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO
UH
BE CONSENSIVE ABOUT ABOUT THINGS
SO IT HAS TO BE A GROUP UH GROUP DECISION

DOES IT HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA UH FUN FUNCTION MORE LIKE
YEAH
YEAH UH AESTHETIC
I MEAN UH YOU MAKE LIKE ELEVEN AND A HALF EUROS PROFIT
INSTEAD OF TWELVE AND A HALF

S SWITCH YES
YEAH
OKAY GO ON
YES VERY GOOD
YEAH
YEAH
THE ORDER
SINGLE CURVES
NO OKAY
WAS INITIAL THE PLAN
THE INITIAL PLAN
NO IT'S IT'S NOT VERY CHEAP BUT THAT NO BUT IT'S A DEVELOPMENT INSIDE CORPORATION
LIKE UH W WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY PARENTAL CONTROL
OUR OWN PEOPLE CAN MAKE THAT I THINK
YEAH IT IT HAS SOME COST BUT
YEAH
REAL REACTION
OKAY
STILL THE END CONCLUSION
THAT'S ALL I THINK
YEAH BUT BUT THE THE DECISIONS ARE PUT IN THE UH CONCLUSION I THINK
WHY WE DECIDED TO USE A FLAT UH L. C. D.
YEAH
UM
SAVE IT
HMM

EXAMPLE OF CHILDREN REMOTE
OH WAIT
WAIT
HMM
THAT'S A PITY
YOU DECLARE

UH SO YOU ALL KNOW
WELL THIS IS THE AGENDA FOR TODAY
WELL THE OPENING IS WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW
UH WE GONNA DO SOME ACQUAINTANCE ACQUAINTANCE THINGS
UH GIVE SOME UM
EXAMPLES OF THE TOOL TRAINING PROJECT PLAN DISCUSSION AND THE CLOSING
WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES
OKAY THE PROJECT AIM IS TO DESIGN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
UH SOME OF THE OJE OBJECTIVES ARE THAT IS HAS TO BE ORIGINAL TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
SO NOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT OUR
GOAL IS
UM I OH FORGET I FORGET THE WHOLE ACQUAINTANCE PART BUT WE WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER
WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER'S NAMES
JOOST GUIDO ANTEK
OKAY
I THINK WE UH AL ALREADY UH BEEN THROUGH THAT PART
OKAY IT CONSISTS OF UH THREE LEVELS OF DESIGN
UH WE BEGIN WITH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THEN WE GO TO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THE DETAILED DESIGN
EVERY UH LEVEL OF DESIGN CONSISTS OF SOME INDIVIDUAL WORK AND WE UH CLOSE IT WITH A MEETING
YOU ALL RECEIVED AN EMAIL WITH A EXAMPLE OF OUR EXPLANATION OF WHAT UH THE PARTICULAR LEVEL OF DESIGN UH MEANS TO THE DIFFERENT UH FUNCTIONS
AND UH YOU P YOU PROBABLY READ THAT ALREADY SO I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT
OKAY FIRST WE'RE GONNA UM UH GONNA TRY SOME DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE TOOLS WE HAVE OVER HERE
SO YOU GET ACQUAINTED WITH THESE UH UM UH MEETING TOOLS
WE HAVE THE SMART BOARDS UH THE THES THOSE TWO BOARDS
THIS IS THE PRESENTATION BOARDS WH WHICH ONE I'M USING RIGHT NOW
YOU CAN UH UM THERE'S A DOCUMENT FOLDER CALLED UM THE SH SHARED DOCUMENT FOLDER
YOU CAN UPLOAD YOUR UH DOCUMENTS TO THAT FOLDER AND THEN YOU CAN OPEN THEM OVER HERE SO YOU CAN DO YOUR POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS ON THIS SCREEN
WE ALSO HAVE THE WHITE BOARD
UH WE'RE GONNA SKIP THROUGH TH
NO NO
JUST ON THE ON THE SCREEN OVER THERE
OH NO
PROBABLY IS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE SOFTWARE IS ON THE LAPTOP
IS IS IF IT'S MAINLY A THING FOR IN THE MEETING SO I DON'T THINK IT'S I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IMPORTANT
THIS AN EXPLANATION OF THE SMART BOARDS
THERE IS A TOOL BAR OVER HERE
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE
YOU HAVE THE THE PEN FUNCTION ERASER FUNCTION
IT'S LIKE A VERY SIMPLE UH PAINT APPLICATION
UH WE WELL WE USE THE SAME FILE DURING UH THE WHOLE DAY
AND UH YOU CAN MAKE NEW SHEETS BY UH BY PU PUTTIN PRESSING ON THE BLANK BUTTON

IT'S NOT WORKING LIKE A PEN YET
HUH
HUH
IT'S DOING SOME STUFF NOW
SO YOU CAN USE A PEN
YOU CAN USE AN ERASER
AND YOU CAN MAKE NEW UH FI UH NEW BLANKS
AND YOU CAN CHANGE UH THE LINE WIDTH AND THE COLOUR OF THE PEN BY PRESSING ON FORWARD WHICH Y YOU HAVE TO SELECT PEN FORMAT
AND THEN SELECT CURRENT COLOUR OR LINE WIDTH
SO IT'S QUITE EASY
UH WELL NOW YOU'RE ALL UH ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFERENT TOOLS
RIGHT WE'RE GONNA TRY OUT THE ELECTRONIC WHITE BOARDS
UH EVERY PARTICIPANT SHOULD DRAW HIS FAVOURITE ANIMAL AND SOME OF ITS FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS ON BLANK SHEETS WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS WITH DIFFERENT PEN WIDTHS
UH I'LL START OFF THEN
I'LL USE THIS UH SAME SHEET
ALRIGHT
OH LET ME THINK
DIFFERENT COLOURS
OH
WELL I'M GONNA DRAW UM A P PIRANHA
UH A FISH
UH
MM-HMM

PLUS UH THE THE BIG UH FOREHEAD AND UH A SMALL UH WELL A SMALL ACTUAL FACE
AND I LIKE ITS OVERALL UH AGGRESSIVE LOOK AND
WELL THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT UH PIRANHA
I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHAT UH THE INTENTION SHOULD BE
WELL WHO WANTS TO BE NEXT
YOU GO GUIDO
OKAY
UH MAKE A NEW SHEET
UH IT'S BY PRESSING ON BLANK
YEP
YEP
AND UH SO IN THE FORMAT MENU YOU CAN CHOOSE THE DIFFERENT UH COLOURS AND UH PEN WIDTHS
WELL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT UH YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE UH PARTICULAR BIRDS
OH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
NO UH IT'S CLEAR

WELL YOU CAN HAVE A PIRANHA AT HOME
HUH
I DON'T THINK UH I DON'T THINK UH DARWIN WOULD AGREE WITH THAT
OKAY
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT THEN
OH OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY AND THEN WE ARE UH THROUGH THE TOOL TRAINING I GUESS
OKAY THIS IS UH SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROJECT FINANCE
THE SELLING PRICE OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL IS GONNA BE TWENTY FIVE EUROS
AND OUR PROFIT AIM IS FIFTEEN MILLION EUROS
WE'RE VERY AMBITIOUS ON THIS ONE
THE MARKET RANGE IS INTERNATIONAL SO IT'S GONNA BE SOLD WORLD WIDE AND THE PRODUCTION COST SHOULD BE A MAXIMUM OF TWELVE EURO FIFTY PER REMOTE CONTROL
SO THAT'S CLEAR
YEAH
OKAY WE'RE NOW GONNA DISCUSS SOME STUFF WHEN WELL WE'RE GONNA BRAINSTORM ABOUT UH WHAT KIND OF KEMORO ROMO REMOTE CONTROL IT'S GONNA BE
UH WELL TELL ME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLS
DO YOU HAVE UH KNOW WHAT GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH REMOTE CONTROLS
OR DO THEY ANNOY YOU SOMETIMES
ARE THEY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND OR MAYBE THEY DON'T INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT KIND OF UH EQUIPMENT VERY WELL
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF OF UH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
AND UH IS IT GONNA BE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S UM WHAT IT CAN BE USED FOR DIFFERENT KIND OF EQUIPMENT LIKE YOUR T. V. AND YOUR HOME STEREO
UH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT UH THE D. V. D. PLAYERS AND HOME CINEMA SETS OFTEN DOUBLE AS STEREO HI FI SETS PROBABLY
IT'S WHAT FROM MY EXPERIENCE
OKAY
BUT WE GONNA
OH IT IS ONLY FOR TELEVIS
SO WHA WHAT
WHAT WHA WHAT UH WHAT DOCUMENT
BUT WHERE WHERE DID IT UH WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT
OH OKAY
YEAH BUT MOST TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROLS SUPPORT OTHER FUNCTIONS AS WELL
SO WE CAN NO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT
OKAY UH BUT UH WE'VE GONNA PUT SOME A UH IS IS IT SO USER FRIENDLINESS IS A IS A PRI PRIORITY IN THIS CASE OR
OKAY
WELL THIS THE MAYBE IS UH SOME ASPECT OF THE UH OR OR SOME POINT AT AT WHICH WE CAN EXCEL BY MAKING IT VERY USEFUL
THAT W WELL THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE THE USABILITY UH MAN SO THIS UH GONNA BE A VERY IMPORTANT TASK FOR YOU THEN
OKAY
WELL OTHER IDEAS
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT TRENDY OR SOMETHING
DO UH BY JUST SH SHAPE AND THE LOOK OF IT
MAYBE A CAN OPENER UNDERNEATH IT
I DON'T KNOW
OR SOMETH SOMETHING SPECIAL LIKE UH M. P. THREE PLAYER INSIDE OF IT OR UH OH WELL THEN THE PRODUCTION COSTS ARE GONNA BE TOO HIGH PROBABLY
OKAY
MAYBE WITH DIFFERENT TYPE OF FRONTS OR UH WELL M HAS TO BE SOMETHING SPECTACULAR OR UH ONE WHICH MAKES IT WE GONNA SKIP BACK TO THE GOALS PROBABLY
UH
ORIGINAL TRENDLY AND USER FRIENDLY WELL WE AL ALSO ALREADY TALKED ABOUT USER FRIENDLINESS
NO WELL SOMETHING TRENDY AND ORIGINAL WELL THAT THAT GOES HAND IN HAND I GUESS
WHEN SOMETHING IS ORIGINAL IT TENDS TO BE TRENDY PROBABLY OR WE SHOULD MAKE IT COMBINATION OF THAT
'KAY SO YOU THE UM TECHNICAL PART OF THE PROCESS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AFTER FOR
SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF UH EQUIPMENT YOU WANT TO UH YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO MANAGE WITH IT
WELL AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART FOR YOU THEN WITH GOGORS REGARDS TO THE USER FRIENDLY PART OF IT
WELL AND YOU UH SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR WHAT MAKES IT TRENDY
WELL YOU KNOW Y LIKE SOME SPECIAL FEATURE
OR SOME DOES IT DOES IT GETS SOME GADGETNESS OR SOMETHING
OKAY
WELL THE CLOSING
NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES
INDIVIDUAL I THINK SO
THE THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER WILL W OR THE WORKING DESIGN OF COURSE WE WILL UH
ALREADY S SAID THAT
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER IS IT A USER INTER USER INTERFACE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS DESIGN
AND THE MANAGEMENT EXPERT OF UH THE MARKETING EXPERT
USER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFI WELL THIS ONE WAS ALREADY CLEAR TO US
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE LEFT
OH NOT MANY I GUESS
WE STARTED AT TWELVE
OH AND WHAT DOES IT SAID
W
OKAY WELL UM
NO WE'RE UH AHEAD OF SCHEDULE THEN
YEAH CLOSE IT
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME MINUTES OR TAKE SOME MINUTES
AND UH IT'S IT'S CLEAR YOU CAN PUT THE STUFF IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS PRESENTATIONS
YOU CAN ALL OR WE'RE ALL UH
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH UH UH MICROSOFT POWERPOINT ARE WE
YEAH OKAY
I'M GONNA WRI UH WRITE SOME STUFF DOWN AND THEN WE'RE READY
OR WE CAN LEAVE ALREADY I GUESS
OR UH OR SH OR SHOULD WE UH OR IS IMPORTANT THAT WE LEAVE AT EXACT UH
OKAY
YES
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER IN UH THIRTY MINUTES

ALRIGHT
WHAT
I'VE GOT A TOUCH PAD
DO YOU KNOW HOW HOW I CAN WAKE IT UP
NO MY LAPTOP
YOU WITH YOUR BRILLIANT IDEAS
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TOUCH THE POWER BUTTON
DO YOU KNOW HOW HOW I CAN WAKE IT UP
OH
COME ON MOVE IT
NOW WAKE UP BITCH
YEAH SO DID I
I CLOSED IT
THAT WASN THAT WASN'T VERY SMART I GUESS
COME ON

DRAWING
OR A LINE
I MEAN A BIRD
HMM
IT'S A HANDICAPPED CAT
HE'S CRYING BECAUSE IT'S UGL BECAUSE OF HIS UGLINESS
I WOULDN'T CALL IT TRAINING BUT
ALRIGHT
I DON'T TH I DON'T THINK THE FOUR OF US GOT PROBLEMS WITH REMOTE CONTROLS BUT IF YOU SEE ELDERLY PEOPLE
ALL THESE BUTTONS AND THEN THEY BUY NEW T. V. BECAUSE THEIR PREVIOUS ONE WAS STOLEN OR WHATEVER
AND THEN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROL WITH WITH DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ON DIFFERENT PLACES AND HALF OF THE FUNCTIONS A ARE REMOVED OR WHATEVER
UH SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS IS A CLEAR UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH
UH GROUPED BUTTONS YOU KNOW
ALL TH ALL THE BUTTONS WHICH APPLY TO THE TEXT FUNCTIONS IN IN ONE UH
WELL ONE AREA OR WHATEVER NOT LIKE THE BUTTON TO ENTER TEXT ON TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE BUTTON TO UM
YEAH TO MINIMISE IT TO THIS THIS OR WHATEVER O O OTHER FUNCTIONS TOTALLY SOMEWHERE ELSE
I THINK WE SHOULD GROUP THEM
AND SAME FOR THE FOR THE VOLUME BUTTONS AND THE THE T
WELL I WAS I WAS THINKING UH SINCE A T. V. IS UH MOSTLY USED TOGETHER WITH A V. C. R. OR D. V. D. PLAYER OR RECORDER
AND NOT WITH A STEREO I THINK IT SHOULD BE GOOD TO INCLUDE FUNCTIONS FOR V. C. R. S AND D. V. D. PLAYERS RECORDERS
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
HI FI SET IS UH NOT OFTEN USED UH AS I KNOW OF IN COMBINATION WITH TELEVISION
YES
YES IT IS ONLY FOR TELEVISION BUT UH
WELL
WELL WE WE'RE GONNA BRAINSTORM ABOUT THAT
IF WE THINK IT'S USEFUL WE DO IT
THAT'S RIGHT
IT'S A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
BUT I WAS THINKING SINCE IT IS USEFUL WITH D. V. D.
YEP
YEAH ALSO NO ONE'S GONNA BUY IT
I GUESS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH WAY TOO HIGH
YEP
WELL THAT'S AN IDEA OF COURSE YEAH
MM-HMM

NO
I DON'T THINK SO
YES
GREAT
YEAH
GOOD LUCK
I WILL NEED IT
OKAY
EVERYBODY READY
WELCOME AT THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING AGAIN PRESENTED BY MAARTEN
UH THIS IS THE AGENDA THE OPENING
UH WE'VE GOT THREE PRESENTATIONS
AND I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOME OF THE NEW PROJECTS REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE SENT TO ME
AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE A DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
WE HAVE UH FORTY MINUTES
OH WELL THIS IS THE THE CLOSING ALREADY
SO UH WELL WE START OFF WITH THE TH THE FIRST PRESENTATION THEN
UH I THINK UM IN UH WE HAVE TO DO IT IN UH IN RIGHT ORDER
MAYBE THE
WELL IT
OH THAT
IT WON'T DOESN'T MAYBE WE SHOULD START WITH THE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
YEAH
WELL IT'S YOU DUMPED THE FILE IN THE UH IN THE SH IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENT FOLDER
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THAT
WELL LET'S CLOSE THIS ONE
WE'LL JUST UH OPEN A NEW ONE
UH WELL
YES
UH OH
NEW THING
OH YEAH UH I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING
UH DUE TO SOME UH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS I HAVEN'T UH DIGITIZED THE LAST UH THE MEETING MINUTES
BUT I'LL UH MAKE SURE THAT UH HAPPENS NEXT TIME
AND I'LL GET THIS ONE UH IN DIGITAL UH FORM TOO
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
BUT IT'S THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
OH
OKAY
WELL WE'LL WE'LL HAVE TO SKIP THAT PART THEN
BUT YOU DON'T THINK IT'S A PROBLEM UM TO DESIGN UH THE TECHNICAL PART OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S GONNA BE EASY
OKAY
YEAH
M
OKAY
R REGARDLESS OF WHAT TYPE OF FUNCTIONS WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
OKAY
WELL WE'LL SEE
WE'LL SEE LATER ON
NO
WELL UH WILL THERE BE SOME UH USER REQUIREMENTS LATER ON
THE ONES I I'VE UH RECEIVED FROM THE ACCOUNT MANAGER
YEAH
WELL WE'LL KEEP THIS IN MIND AND THEN DISCUSS IT LATER ON
UH-HUH
OKAY BUT THIS REAL THIS UH BIG D UH DISTINCTION BETWEEN THIS TYPE OF REMOTE
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD CHOOSE ONE UH WE SHOULD NOT COMPROMISE BUT UH REALLY CHOOSE FOR UH EXPERT VIEWER OR NOVICE V YEAH
WELL WHAT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TRYING TO SAY
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH WELL SOME OF THESE UH YEAH
WELL SOME OF THAT WILL YEAH BUT I BUT IT WILL BE MORE CLEAR WHEN WE COME TO THE UH U UH SOME OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS
SO
MM-HMM
OKAY
WELL THEN THE MARKETING EXPERT CAN UH TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE CURRENT MARKET
OKAY
VISUALLY PRESENTS
OKAY
WELL THEN WE I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOME OF THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND THEN WE GONNA DISCUSS ON UH WHAT FEATURES WE FIND IMPORTANT
UH WELL SOME OF THE UH NEW REQUIREMENTS MAKE SOME OF YOUR FINDINGS QUITE UH IRRELEVANT I THINK
BECAUSE UM
UH S DECIDED TO PUT THEY HAVE DECIDE TO PUT TWO ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FORWARD
WELL NOW I SEE FOUR
THAT'S KINDA STRANGE
WELL THEY SAY TELE TELETEXT BECOMES OUTDATED SINCE THE POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET
WELL I THINK THAT MAY BE SO BUT WELL WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE THE TELETEXT BUTTON OFF
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I THINK
SO THE COMPROMISE WE COULD MAKE IS JUST TO MAKE ONE TELETEXT BUTTON YOU KNOW LIKE ON AND OFF
AND DON'T MAKE A LOT OF SPECIAL PUT A LOT OF SPECIAL FEATURES ON IT TO MAKE IT TRANSPARENT OR YOU KNOW
IT'S JUST YOU WANT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF TELETEXT BUT NOT TO PLAY WITH IT THAT MUCH
SO WE HAVE TO THINK OF THAT
THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TELEVISION
OTHERWISE THE PROJECT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX WHICH ENDANGERS THE TIME T T MA UH THE TIME TO MARKET
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE ALL D. V. D. AND V. C. R. RELATED FEATURES OFF COMPLETELY
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK THAT UH
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY
UH OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS ARE WITHIN THE AGE GROUP OF FORTY PLUS
NEW PRODUCTS SHOULD REACH A NEW MARKET WITH CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN FORTY
SO YOU UH TALKED ABOUT THE ELDERLY WHO WERE WILLING TO SPEND MORE ON A REMOTE CONTROL AND WHO WERE INTERESTED
BUT WELL THEY'RE NOT RELEVANT BECAUSE WE ARE AIMING AT A YOUNGER
YEAH BUT IT IS IT'S IS A DIF IT'S A FACT THAT THE TH TH THAT BIGGER MARKET YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE ALREADY COVER THAT
OUR COMPANY ALREADY SELLS REMOTE CONTROL TO THE OLDER PEOPLE BUT WE WE ALSO WANT YOU KNOW A NEW CUSTOMER GROUP
THAT'S THE ONE WE HAVEN'T COVERED YET
SO I THINK THAT'S
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS
WE HAVEN'T GOT REMOTE CONTROLS FOR UH WELL I THINK YEAH
YEAH I THINK SO
MAYBE IF IT'S NO NO BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO JUST KEEP IN MIND WHAT THE OLDER AGE GROUP WANTS
SO MAYBE WE CAN
MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S PRIMARILY INTERESTING FOR THE YOUNGER GROUP BUT ISN'T THAT BAD FOR AN OLDER PERSON EITHER
UH OUR CORPORATE IMAGE SH SHOULD STAY RECOGNISABLE IN OUR PRODUCTS
OUR PRODUCT'S CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEW DESIGN
OKAY SOMETHING ELSE NICE TO KNOW
SORRY
YEAH YOU WILL HAVE TO LOOK THAT UP
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE OH OKAY
I THOUGHT IT W MIGHT BE LET'S MAKE THINGS BETTER OR SOMETHING BUT
OKAY WELL LET'S GO BACK TO THE
THE AGENDA
SO WE'VE NOW HAD TO THE THREE PRESENTATIONS
WE KNOW ABOUT THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
THAT MEANS WE CAN UH WELL D YEAH DISCUSS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
WELL IF I CAN UH MAKE A START I THINK IT'S BECOMING MORE CLEAR WHAT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROL IT'S GONNA BE
AND I ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE MAYBE YOU HAVE A F FAMILIAR WITH THE REM REMOTE CONTROL THAT HAS THE THE CAN OPENER UNDERNEATH IT
I THINK WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME YEAH WE WE'RE LOOKING FOR A REALLY SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL WITH ONLY BASIC T. V. FUNCTIONS
Y WELL THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
M YEAH THAT'S WHY UM WELL A LOT OF UM THE USE THE REQUIREMENTS THE THE ACCOUNT MANAGER SENT ME
I THINK THEY ARE ARE C ARE CONTRADICTING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY WANT A SIMPLER DESIGN
AND NO UH OTHER UH S FUNCTIONS THAN JUST T. V. BUT THEY S DO AIM AT A YOUNGER WELL MA
BUT I THINK UH YOU WE CAN MAKE SOME DISCUSS UH DISTINCTIONS IN UH WHAT KIN IN THE KNOW TH TH IN FUNCTIONS YOU HAVE
Y
WELL YOU HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF UH EQUIPMENT IN YOUR ROOM LIKE A T T. V. AND A D. V. D. PLAYER
YOU CAN UH KNOW
YOU YOU CAN MAKE VERY D YOU CAN PUT VERY DETAILED FUNCTIONS REGARDING THE T. V. SET ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UH WITH THE WITH UH THE
YOU KNOW AUDIO SETTINGS AND UH V UH SCREEN SETTINGS
WE DON'T WANT THAT
I THINK THAT WAS THAT BECAME CLEAR
WE DON'T WANT
BUT W MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT SOME FUNC UH I KNOW THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE A D. V. D. PLAYER THEY WANT TO
YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO UH
CONTROL REMOTELY
NO YEAH TH TH THE USER REQUIREMENTS OF THE THE THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS TOLD US NOT TO BUT MAYBE W YEAH
I THINK WE MAYBE SHOULD
YEAH WELL WE SHOULD UH PUT SOME FUNCTIONS FOR OTHER MAYBE FOR OTHER EQUIPMENT ON IT
BUT JUST THE BASIC FUNCTIONS
MAYBE LIKE REWIND AND WIND OR N WHAT D WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
YEAH IF AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
DO TH SHOULD WE IMPLEMENT FEATURES THAT UH UH OR FUNCTIONS THAT TO CONTROL OTHER DEVICES
NO YOU DON'T THINK SO
YEAH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS SAY SO
WELL
MAYBE IT'S MAYBE THERE THERE THERE IS SOMETHING TH M MOST OF THE TIME THESE FUNCTIONS DON'T SUPPORT THE PARTICULAR DEVICE AS WELL AS THEIR THEIR OWN REMOTE CONTROL
YOU KNOW A LOT OF D. V. D. PLAYERS HAVE SOME TRICKY SETTINGS WITH
YEP EXACTLY
THAT'S THAT'S WHA
NO NO YOU DON'T NO NO YOU DON'T NEED IT
NO NO
OKAY BUT WE HAVE TO THINK UH W WE HAVE TO THINK D. V. D. I TH UH I GUESS
SO UM BUT UH FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT'S KINDA A LOT OF D. V. D. PLAYERS YOU KNOW LIKE FORWARDING GOES DIFFERENTLY
UH YOU GET TWO SPEED OR EIGHT SPEED OR SIXTEEN SPEED
IT'S C SOMETIMES A BIT DIFFICULT
MAYBE IF WE JUST LEAVE THE D. V. D. FUNCTIONAL M UH WELL I WAS THINKING ABOUT PUTTING IT IN
BUT CONCERNING THE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT YOU JUST SAID I THINK WE M SHOULD FOCUS ON THE T. V. THEN
AND UH AND IT'S JUST AN UH A COMPLIMENTARY REMOTE AND NOT A UNIVERSAL ONE
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE YOU CAN MAKE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE
OKAY
IT'S JUST A S IT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS LIKE A GADGET ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE
AND IT'S JUST FOR WHEN YOU YOU YOU JUMP ON THE COUCH
YOU PICK UP THE THE THE NICE REMOTE THE SIMPLE ONE JUST TO PUT ON THE TELEVISION NOTHING MORE
OKAY
UM BUT WHAT TELEVIS
YEAH WE WE'LL MAKE W THIS ONE TRENDY
AND SIMPLE
WELL WE WE WILL COME TO THAT BUT JU FIRST ON THE ON THE FUNCTIONS
SO WE SHOULD PUT UH ZAP BUTTONS ON IT
UM ALSO NUMBERS TO UH TO GO TO THE SPECIFIC CHANNELS
UH
OKAY A T A TELETEXT BUTTON SHOULD BE THERE
BUT JUST ONE BIG TELETEXT BUTTON ON AND OFF
PROBABLY
OH OKAY
YEAH BUT UH I THINK THAT BECOMES TOO DIFFICULT IT'S NOT A VERY COMMON FUNCTION AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO READ UP ON THEIR REMOTE THEN
YEAH YEAH BUT MAYBE YOU S YEAH YEAH MAYBE Y YOU DO BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND
WE HAVE TO WELL T YEAH AND T AND TELETEXT IS BECOMING OUTDATED
WE JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT PROGRAMMES ARE ON AND WHAT TIME IT IS PROBABLY
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK THAT THAT'S KIN GETTING TOO COMPLEX FOR OUR REMOTE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TH GUYS THINK
YEAH BUT DO YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SUCH A S STOP BUTTON
OR DO YOU THINK IT UH
I THINK IT'S A KIND OF UH UH VERY RARE AND SPECIAL FUNCTION
YEAH
OKAY IT GOES YEAH BUT THAT'S KIND OF STUFF WE SHOULD DO ON THE INTERNET RIGHT NOW
THAT'S WHY IT WAS UH SAID IN THE IN THE USE IN THE R NEW REQUIREMENTS
WELL YEAH UH LOTS OF NEW TELEVISIONS CAN STORE PAGES YOU KNOW
AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SKIP MANUALLY THROUGH THEM USING I THINK WE SHOULD JUST PUT ONE TELETEXT BUTTON ON IT
THEN WE MEET UH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS
WE ALSO MEET THE OTHER THIN Y YOU SH YOU JUST RE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FOR THE THE SIMPLE DESIGN I GUESS
OKAY
UM WELL WHAT FUNCTIONS DO WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON
OR DO WE UH I DUNNO IF WE HAVE T STIF SPECIFICALLY NAME ALL THE FUNCTIONS WE N WE WANT
WE HAVE THE ZAP AND UH THE VOLUME
SHOULD WE DO M MAKE THEM VERY BIG
THE THE THE ZAP BUTTON
D D
TH THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE TRENDY ALSO
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD PLACE THEM ON A UH IN A SPECIAL WAY
YEAH SOMETHING OR UH SOMETHIN SPECIAL WAY TO TO ZAP THROUGH THE IT HAS TO S IT HAS TO BE YEAH AND QUICK
YOU HAVE TO USE IT VERY QUICKLY
YEAH AND IT THE BUTTONS SHOULD MAKE IT UM POSSIBLE TO TO ZAP THROUGH YOUR CHANNELS IN A RAPID AT A RAPID PACE
OH WHAT SHOULD WE DECIDE ON THEN
I THINK IN A IN A CASE OF THIS SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL
THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS WHICH UH WEREN'T WORKED OUT ALREADY BUT IT W SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM THEN
YEP
NO OKAY BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO UH WHEN WE DON'T WANT TO UH CONTROL OTHER DEVICES I THINK IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE SIMPLE
I THINK
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD USE UH D YEAH
NOT NOT UH THE B THE WATCH KIND TH THE MOST UH WELL IT HAS TO BE SIMPLE AND I WI
WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE YOU KNOW
OH
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HA WE HAVE LEFT UH
M M M MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES
UH TEN TWENTY MINUTES
WELL UH THESE THESE SHOULDN'T
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
BUT THAT'S THAT'S
DO YOU UH HAVE YOU HAVE YOU THINK ABOUT THA THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
HOW WE CAN WHAT THE EXTRA TOUCH CAN BE
DO YOU SUGGEST DESIGN OR THE SHAPE OR SOME GADGET F F KIND OF FEATURE OR WELL IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW WE LOSE THEM
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE A REMOTE CONTROL WHEN YOU YOU CLAP YOU HANDS IT MAKES SOME NOISE OR SOME GADGET KIND OF THING
YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
NAH UM A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE SUCH KIND KIND OF KIND OF GAY KIND OF THINGS
IT W IT W SHOULD BE LIKE A BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR SOMETHING THAT YOU GIVE SOMEONE AND IT IS I HAS SOMETHING NICE
OR MAYBE IT W SHOULD HAVE A BIG UH LIGHT THAT CAN FLASH OR SOMETHING ON IT
OR MAYBE IT SHOULD OR AN OR THE LIKE THE THE CAN OPENER
MAYBE IT CONTAINS SOME FEATURE THAT YOU DON'T NORMALLY LINK TO A REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPOR BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA MAKE SUCH A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE IT SPECIAL
IT'S GONNA COST TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEAH BUT THE WELL IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE
NAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
BUT AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE UH VERY UH IT HAS TO BE STURDY OR SOMETHING
SO MAYBE WITH WITH BOUNCING PADS SO THAT YOU CAN JUST THROW IT ON THE FLOOR OR SOMETHING
IT HAS TO BE USED SOMETHING SPECIAL AND YOU REALLY IT HAS TO
YOU KNOW Y NOT S PEOPLE WHEN THEY BUY IT THEY HAVE TO THINK WELL THIS ONE LASTS FOR A LONG TIME
WE'RE REALLY GONNA USE THEM
NOT SOME THING YOU YOU THROW AWAY NEXT WEEK YOU KNOW
SO MAYBE UH THAT'S I I THINK THAT'S WHEN UH WHEN WE DECIDE ON THESE TYPE OF FUNCTIONS
KNOW BASIC FUNCTIONS UH IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO FIND SOMETHING LIKE THIS
SO THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT TASK FOR YOU
AND MAYBE WE CAN ALL THINK ABOUT IT
UH ALSO FOR YOU MAYBE WHEN T YOU IT'S VERY NICE WHEN YOU CAN BE ENTRA WHEN YOU CAN BE TRENDY
AND AND UH AND AL AS IN A FRIEND USE FRIENDLY AS WELL YOU KNOW
SO BIG BUTTONS FLASHY DESIGN AND MAYBE SOME KIND OF GADGET KIND OF THING
UH-HUH
YEAH OR JUST DIFFERENT COLOURS WOULD BE UH I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE ALSO WANNA SPEND MORE MONEY ON FRONTS FOR THEIR UH REMOTE CONTROL
IT COULD BE BE YEAH YOU NEVER KNOW BUT
BUT IT AND I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE IT QUITE BIG
YEAH PEOPLE
SO AND AND ALSO BECAUSE UH IT IS EXPENSIVE
IF YOU WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT'S HA DOESN'T HAVE MUCH FUNCTIONS WANT TO BE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT L MAKE IT
MM-HMM
AND SHOU AND SHOULD NI LOOK NICE WHEN YOU PUT IT ON A TABLE
I I THINK YOU M MIGHT WANNA PUT IT UH YEAH THAT IT IT IT IT STANDS UP
YEAH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT ON ITS SO IT'S LIKE A VASE OR UH SOMETHING YOU PUT ON A TABLE
NO NO PUT STUFF INSIDE IT
BUT IT'S LIKE LIKE A STATUE OR SOMETHING
YEAH YEAH BUT YEAH BUT YOU ALSO CAN PUT IT SOMEWHERE NEAR THE WINDOW IN
THAT IT'S IT'S FASHIONABLE
I I DON'T
OH YEAH
YEAH BUT BUT WHEN YOU WHEN IT GETS LOST HOW CAN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON TO MAKE IT
OH OKAY
UH THAT'S KIND OF NICE
AND THEN ALSO YOU DON'T EVEN NEED BATTERIES BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE IT UH CHARGEABLE
YEAH THAT W YEAH BUT YEAH THE PRO NO WELL I THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE T P WELL NEE BUT WE DON'T YEAH
MAYBE YOU BUT WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT PRODUCTION COST
BUT WHEN YOU YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT WHEN YOU SPEND TWENTY FIVE EUROS ON A REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'S A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL
THEN THE THEN THE MONEY THERE MUST BE MONEY TO SPEND ON THAT KIND OF ST YOU KNOW RECHARGEABLE UNITS
YEAH BUT WE WOULD D MA WE'D DO IT IN TAIWAN AND SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT EXPEN
UH I I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA
S SOME KIND OF BE I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE AND YOU MAKE IT UH UM BE UH YOU SEE IT WITH UH THE MO THE MOUSES NOWADAYS
WELL I WELL IT'S REALLY CH YOU CAN RECHARGE IT SO YOU HA NEVER HAVE THE BATTERY PROBLEM
THAT'S ONE
AND UH YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UP
UH OKAY
WELL MAYBE YEAH YOU COULD WHEN THAT'S WHEN IT'S TOO COSTLY YOU COULD PROBABLY SKIP THE RECHARGER
BUT YOU WILL YOU DO NEED UH ALSO AN UH ALSO YOU WOULD NEED A BATTERY IN THE THE BASE UNIT AS WELL YOU KNOW
DOES IT MAKES IT KINDA
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH BUT THEN IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE IT ALSO A RECHARGEAB I DON'T THINK THAT IS GONNA COST MUCH TO MAKE IT ALSO A RECHARGE FUNCTION IN IT
YEAH
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
AND MAKE IT YOU KNOW WE WE UM
WELL WE UH IT'S IT ISN'T A T A MOST UH COSTLY UH REMOTE CONTROL
WE CAN SAVE ON THE ON THE FUNCTIONS
WE JUST PUT SOME SIMPLE BUTTON IN MAKE IT BIG AND STURDY NOTHING MORE AND JUST MAKE S SURE THERE'S SOME NOISE THAT IT CAN MAKE
OR PROBABLY SOME KIND OF CHEAP LIGHT THING AROUND IT OR THAT IT UH THAT IT LIGHTS UP IT'S ALSO NICE
AND IF YOU PUT IT AWAY I THINK IT'S UH W WE HAVE TO WE UH THAT'S UH IT'S NOT A EASY MARKET
WE HAVE TO SOMETHING SPECIAL
AND FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING REMOTE C SPECIAL FROM YOUR MOTE CONTROL
AND WE CAN'T DELIVER THAT IN R WITH UH REGARDS TO THE FUNCTIONS BECAUSE WE AREN'T GONNA PUT
YEAH
AND THEN UH WHEN MAKE IT YOU KNOW NICE LOOKING SHAPE AND THIS AND THEN YOU ALSO YOU GOT THE STAND UP THING
YEAH
I THINK I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
OH IF IT LET'S WELL WE WILL SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE THE COSTS AND IF IT'S POSSIBLE WE'LL DO THAT
AND WE EVEN TRY TO SAVE UP ON OTHER STUFF TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO SUCH A THING
AND THE FIRST THING WE THE MOST LIKEABLE THING TO TO N TO SKIP IS THEN PROBABLY THE RECHARGE FUNCTION OR SOMETHING
IF THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE WE WON'T DO THAT
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE
IT'S THE IDEA
I KNOW THAT BATTERIES LAST LONG NOWADAYS
AND AND WHAT PEOPLE JUST THINK ABOUT WELL I'LL NEVER HAVE TO BUY ANY R BATTERIES AGAIN
SO Y B BECAUSE IT'S VERY ANNOYING WHEN YOUR BATTERY IS EMPTY
AND YOU KNOW THEN WHEN YOU HAVEN'T BATTERIES AROUND AND PROBABLY FOR TWO WEEKS YOUR REMO I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT THAT
YEAH OKAY
SO EASY FUNCTIONS
WELL WE WILL WE WILL I THINK WE'LL WORK THAT OUT ZAPPING NUMBERS ON IT BI
YEAH
BUT IT'S ALSO ANNOYING
'CAUSE AS LONG AS IT STAYS AS IT KE KEEPS WORKING YOU'RE NOT VERY MOTIVATED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
THEN IT BEEPS ALL THE TIME AND
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE EVER HAVE THOSE PROBLEMS AND YOU WON'T HAVE IF IF YOU HAVE THE RECHARGEABLE
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE UNIT YOU CAN ALSO PUT IT ON THE SIDE IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT
UH I I IN THE IN THE MA YEAH BUT IT W I MEAN
IF IF THEY PAY FOR IT BECAUSE THEY THINK OH THAT'S A GREAT IDEA I'M GONNA USE IT
AND WHEN IT YOU KNOW WHEN TIME GOES BY AND THEY THINK WELL I'LL NEVER PUT HIM IN THE RECHARGER
I THINK LAST LONG ENOUGH THEN THEY PUT IT ON SIDE AND THEY CAN USE IT NOW AND THEN
THEN WHEN THEY LOOK GET M I I I KNOW FOR SURE THAT EVERYBODY WHO BUYS THIS REMOTE CONTROL
WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS OF THEY WILL BE IN THE SITUATION THAT THEY THEY'RE SEEKING FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
THEY WANNA SEE SOMETHING QUICK AND UH JUST PUSH THE BUTTON AND TH UH I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT
YEAH I'VE NEVER IT'S SO SIMPLE BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT
M MAYBE WE SHOULD REALLY DO THIS
OKAY NOW WELL HOW MUCH TIME HAVE WE GOT LEFT
THESE CLOCKS AREN'T UH SYNCHED
OH NOW I'VE PUT UH WELL IT IS TWENTY P OKAY SO WE HAVE TEN MINUTES OR SOMETHING
YEAH BUT WE'RE UH WE'RE DONE
I THINK
WE'VE DECIDED ON THE FUNCTIONS
WELL THERE IS SOME OH
THERE IS A CLOSING SHEET
WE HAVE LUNCH BREAK AND THEN WE HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF INDIVIDUAL WORK
OH OKAY I'LL MAKE SURE I'LL I HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH UH THE DIGITISING THE THE FIRST MINUTES
THE THE S THE NEXT MINUTES WON'T BE A PROBLEM
BUT I'LL TRY TO MAKE SURE THE FIRST ONE WILL BE IN THE FOLDER TOO BUT MAYBE IT WON'T WORK BUT YOU'LL SEE
I THINK THESE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE FIRST ONES SO
OH FIVE MINUTES
YEAH BECAUSE UH I I D I DID UH THE FIRST MINUTES I DID WERE WERE WERE A BIT SCRATCHY YOU KNOW
THEN I DID A S SECOND ONE WITH A NICER LAYOUT WHICH I COULD UH KNOW
USE FOR THE OTHER ONES WELL BUT UH I D THINK UH I FORGOT TO DO PUT DONE UNDER THE FIRST ONE
AND WHEN YOU GO WRITE A SECOND UH IT'S GET IT'S NOT WORKING WHEN YOU TRY TO WRITE SECOND UH PAPER OR SOMETHING
AND THEN YOU YOU HAD TO OVERWRITE IT OR SOMETH I DON'T KNOW
BECAU I D UH IT WAS NOT MY UH PEN
THIS KIND OF LOOKS YOU LIKE
OF THE SHAPE
YEAH PROBABLY IT WOULD BE NICE
NO BIGGER
WELL I I I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE THIS UH CAN OPENING REMOTE CONTROL IN MY HEAD MOST OF ALL
OR I THINK SOME MAYBE WE SHOULD NO THAT WILL BE TOO COSTLY
WE SHOU WE COULD ALSO THAT WAS A WOULD ALSO BE AN IDEA BUT I DON'T THINK IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT EXISTS ALREADY
YOU SHOULD LIKE MAKE ALESSI OR SOMETHING DESIGN IT
THAT WOULD ALSO BE NICE
BUT THAT'S GONNA THEN YOU C THEN YOU DON'T
YEAH BUT THEN YOU DON'T HAVE T YEAH IT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I THAT'S IN THE PRODUCTION COST A ONE IT'S A ONE TIME
YOU KNOW S WAS IT'S A SINGLE COST
YEAH M BUT BUT THEN YOU CAN NAH I DON'T THIN I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE
BECAUSE I'VE BOUGHT THE ALESSI STUFF MORE OFTEN AND EVEN SMALL PENCIL HOLDERS OR SOMETHING ARE MORE EXPENSIVE
WOULD BE A NICE IDEA THOUGH
I DON'T KNOW
I THINK IT UH HAS TO BE A R IT HAS TO HAVE ROUND FORMS OR SOMETHING
LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR SO OR SO
AND ON TH AND THEN UH S A BASE UNIT UNDERNEATH IT
IT'S ALSO ROUND
PUT IT IN THERE UH WIRE ON IT
MAYBE UH I DON'T KNOW SOME SOME LIGHTS A BIG BUT WELL
VOLUME AND PROGRAMME YEAH
AND SOME OF THE EXTRA FUNCT
SOME OF THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS OVER HERE
NUMBERS
AND AND LIGHTS
HOW WE'RE G WELL MAYBE UH S A RING OF NO NO YOU HAVE TO MAYBE ON THE SIDE OF IT
ALONG THE SIDE UH STRIP OF YEAH
YEAH BUT I ALSO MEANT THE THE BLINKING LI W YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT ALSO BLINK WHEN YOU TRY TO UH UH LOCATE YOUR REMOTE
WELL THEYS HAVE TO BE
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
EXACTLY
WHEN YOU YOU SEE IT FROM THE SIDE THEN IT WOULD LOOK JUST LIKE THAT
AND THEN YOU HAVE
A STRIP OF UH LIGHTS OR SOMETHING
WELL UH I THINK IT'S NICE FOR ONE THING
MAYBE PUT SOMETHING ON TOP OF IT OR YOU KNOW LIKE THAT'S LOOKS FUNNY
I DON'T KNOW
OR SOME BUMP
MAYBE SOME YEAH
WE'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
I THINK WE'RE WE'RE DONE
WE CAN SAVE THIS ONE
MM MM
YEAH THAT WAS WHAT UH
MM WE'LL HEAR ABOUT IT
HERE WE GO AGAIN
OH
OKAY
MM OKAY
YEAH IT'S OKAY
OKAY
NO
IN PROJECT
NO CAN THAT OPEN
OPEN IT THERE
OKAY
ABOUT THE GET
OKAY
BUT NOTHING RESTRICTED FOR USER INTERFACE
WITH TECHNICAL
I DON'T KNOW
'KAY
OKAY
BUT I KIND OF UH
YES
UH
WELL THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
UM WELL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT THE SAME UH PICTURES AS I GOT BUT UH I GOT THESE TWO
AND I THINK THEY'RE WE HAVE TO FOCUS UH ON UH THE UH ONE HAND THE EXPERT VIEW OR THE NOVICE USER
TH I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH UH DEPENDING ON THE USER REQUIREMENTS I DON'T S UH KNOW WHO'S DOING T
YEAH BUT IT I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO WATCH UH WHAT KIND OF FUNCTIONS THERE WE WANT TO UH PUT IN A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH WELL Y WE CAN PUT FUNCTIONS IN IT WHEN UH YEAH WHEN WE UH GET THE USER REQUIREMENTS UH AND WE CAN UPDATE IT
WELL YEAH W IF YOU WANT TRY A A A HUGE MARKET IF YOU WANT TO REACH A HUGE MARKET
UH LIKE ELDERLY PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FOR NOVICE USER
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IT'S IT'S REALLY UM DEPENDING ON HOW HOW HOW FAR THE THE THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE ALREADY IN N UM IN USE
YEAH PROBABLY YEAH
UH WELL THERE ARE L AT LEAST UH BASIC FUNCTIONS UH LIKE JUST TH THE CHANNELS UH ONE TILL NINE
UH ON AND OFF SWITCH WHICH MUST BE CLEAR WITH A RED BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UM MOST STANDARD UH HAVE VOLUME OF COURSE AND A MUTE FUNCTION AND OF COURSE THE NEXT AND PREVIOUS CHANNEL
I THINK THAT'S JUST BASIC WHAT WE NEED
AND FROM THAT ON WE CAN USER REQUIREMENTS WHAT WE NEED MORE
UH
YEAH I JUST UM UM I THOUGHT JOOST WAS LOOKING AT THE TRENDY THE TRENDS IN THE MARKETS
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE UH ARE ANY UM UH IF YOU PUT MORE FUNCTIONS MORE BUTTONS MAYBE IT'S COM BECOMING LESS TRENDY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
M YOU CAN JUST YOU CAN K YOU CAN KEEP IT IN MIND THAT
I DON'T KNOW
UH I TH I THOUGHT THE THE WITH LESS BUTTONS YOU CAN MAKE A MORE TRENDIER UH YEAH MORE TRENDIER DESIGN I THINK
I THINK
YEAH
UH WELL THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY I THINK
YEAH THAT WAS IT
OKAY
WELL
NO WAY
YEAH
BUT WHAT'S OUR SLOGAN
THE SLOGAN UH
PUTS FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
SENSE SIMPLICITY
YEAH
YEAH BUT WHA
BUT
YEAH BUT YOU SAI YOU SAID THAT THAT A LOT OF FUNCTIONS AREN'T USED
SO WHY SHOULD J WE PUT THIS FUNCTION IN
I THINK MORE I THINK UH PEOPLE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE MORE LOOKING FOR JUST A TRENDY LOOK THAN UH MORE FUNCTIONS
YEAH BUT UH YOU SAID YEAH D YEAH BUT TH THE FUNCTIONS ARE NOT IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WE'RE MAKING
IT'S N
YEAH
YEAH
NO
NO NEW REQUIREMENTS SAY NO
SO
YEAH BUT
I I IF IT'S TOO SIMPLE UH TH THEY WON'T USE THE REMOTE CONTROL THEY USE THEIR OWN TH TH WITH LOT MORE FUNCTIONS
NO NO
EXACTLY
MM YEAH
YEAH BUT JUST
KEEP IT SIMPLE AND LOOK MORE AT TH
NO
IT'S ONLY FOR TELEVISION
SO
YEAH
YEAH NOTHING MORE
EXACTLY
YEAH
THE USER INTERFACE IS EASY
AND THE BASIC YEAH BASIC FUNCTIONS YEAH
IT'S TOO MUCH INTEGRATED IN THE OTHER
YEAH
WILL YOU LOOK
LOOK AT THE MARKET
WELL
YEAH I UH IT'S SUNDAY I ALWAYS USE IT FOR THE UH YEAH FOR THE SOCCER UH
WELL UH WHEN YOU UH UH WHEN YOU LOOK UH FOR EXAMPLE UM
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I LOOKED AT THE FOR THE FLIGHTS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF FLIGHTS IN ONE PAGE SO IF IF TH
YEAH BUT
TRUE
A SIMPLE YEAH
BUT TRENDY YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
ORIGINAL
IT WAS UH
TRUE
YEAH
MAYBE UH
UH MAYBE WE UH UH THE BATTERIES MAYBE
IF YOU USE LARGE BATTERIES OR SMALL BATTER BATTERIES
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
EARLY BREAK
TO FIND HIM
THAT'S MAYBE YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT'S YEAH
YEAH
BE ORIGINAL YEAH
MM-HMM
AND USE FRIENDLY YEAH
YEAH
MUST BRAIN STORM
WELL
WHY NOT
MORE MONEY FOR US
YEAH
QUITE BIG
YEAH YOU THINK
A STANDARD OR SOMETHING
IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE UH FOUR PHONES
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ON THE TELEVISION
OH LIKE THIS
A CHAR CHARGEABLE
YEAH
WHY NOT
PRODUCTION
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO MAKE A BASE OR SOMETHING
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S
IT'S NOT THE PURPOSE TO BE HANDY IT'S
MM
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT IT'S UGLY I THINK
NO
YEAH
TRUE
YEAH
YEAH IT MUST BE MUST BE A GADGET TO HAVE
YEAH
YEAH WE C
OR JUST GIVE A BEEP WHEN THE BATTERY'S OUT OR UH DOWN
YEAH
TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
AND YOU CAN LEAVE IT JUST THERE
YEAH
YES
YEAH I'LL
UH FIFTEEN MINUTES
CAN YOU MAKE AN UH UH
A PART OF F FOLDER FOR THE MINUTES MAYBE
THAT NOT NOT EVERYTHING IN ONE ONE UH FOLDER
YEAH
MAYBE
OR THE SH
DO YOU GET AN IDEA OF THE SHAPE
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER YEAH BUT
OH UH LOOK UH LOOK AT THE PICTURES
YEAH FLASH LIGHTS AT THE SIDE
AT THE SIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH SIDE OF IT
JUST TWO LEDS OR SOMETHING ON THE SIDE
YEAH
YEAH
WELL UH PROBABLY AT THE SIDE
YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE FRONT BUT
YEAH EXACTLY AND THEN THERE IS YEAH
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
NO
NO
BUMPER OR SOMETHING
YEAH
LUNCH BREAK
OKAY THEN
OKAY FIVE UH
OH
MY MOUSE IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE
HE'S UH WHEN I PUT IT IN IS IS GOING TO BEEP BEEP BEEP
HUH
OKAY HOW CAN I GET THIS ON THE WHITEBOARD
OKAY I'VE DONE THAT
YES
'KAY WE'RE GOING TO UM
UH TALK ABOUT WORKING DESIGN
UM THE METHOD OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS UH ELECTRICAL ENERGY IT ACTIVATES A CHIP UH IN THE REMOTE
IT'S AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT
WHICH COMPOSE UH MESSAGES IN THE FORM OF UH UH INFRARED SIGNALS TO CONTROL THE TELEVISION
MM IT'S A NOWADAYS VERY UH KNOWN A KNOWN UH UH TECHNOLOGY
UM THE KNOWN TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE A COST VERY LOW
UH IT'S A WILD UH A WIDE SALE UH OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE WORLD
AND AND THE COMPONENTS ARE VERY UH VERY CHEAP
UM
UH DIODES UH BAT BATTERIES AND UH UH LED LIGHTS THEY'RE NEEDED AND THEY'RE UH EVERYWHERE AVAILABLE
UH AGAIN IT'S A FAIR PRICE
IT'S A COMMON UH TECHNOLOGY UH LIKE I TOLD UM UH THE CIRCUIT BOARD IT'S THE MOST UM IMPORTANT UH
UM PART OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UH WE CAN USE FOR THAT UH FIBREGLASS WITH COPPER WIRES IT'S IT IS UH
CAN BE MADE AS FAST AS PRINTING PAPER
IT'S UH IT'S ALL VERY UH
YEAH THEY'RE MAKING IT UH ALL THE TIME
UH
AND IT'S NOT UH VERY SPECIALISED UH TECHNOLOGY
I HAVEN'T COME TO HERE BUT
UM I'VE GOT UH SOME UH IMAGES OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS
THEY WERE NOT UH VERY UH TRENDY OR JUST UH
JUST A REMOTE CONTROL LIKE EVERYONE KNOWS
SO I DON'T KNOW UH WHY I SHOULD PUT IT HERE
UH
YES BUT UH I UH HAVEN'T MADE IT BECAUSE UH OF THE TIME
BUT
WHAT
NO
YES
UM NO IT'S UH IT'S JUST A PART OF UH A KNOWN TECHNOLOGY YEAH
REMOTE CONTROL IS NOTHING SPECIAL NOWADAYS
UM
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE OF THE ALL THE TELEVISIONS UH THERE ARE A FEW MAYBE A COUPLE OF TELEVISIONS WITH THE NEW FUNCTIONS
BUT IS IT USEFUL TO PUT THEM ON A ON A STANDARD UH REMOTE
NO
BUT YOU CAN PUT THEM UNDER THE SAME BUTTON
BUT YOU CAN PUT A PLAY AND STOP AND AND REWIND
YES BUT WE
HUH
YES BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE
BUT HOW WI HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO HANDLE A WHOLE MARKET
THERE ARE UH A DOZEN OF UH DOZENS OF OF REMOTE CONTROLS THAT HAVE
YES BUT YOU COULD PUT
ON THE Z ON THE ZAP BUTTONS YOU CAN PUT IT TO UH TO UH ACCESS ALL THE SAME PAGES
IF YOU HAVE SEVEN PAGES YOU CAN GO UP AND DOWN
YES
YES
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE UH A KIND OF A JOYSTICK
BUT
NO IT'S O JUST SIGNALS UH AND THE TELEVISION D UH DOES THE REST
NO
THE MOST STANDARD BATTERIES
BUT I IN A WAY WE HAVE TO BE UH UH SPECIAL
MAYBE TH M
FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
THAT'S TO BE UH A FORMED FOR YOUR HAND
MORE LIKE A JOYSTICK THEN
BUT THAT'S THAT'S FUN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THEN THE SECOND
OR YOU CAN
YEAH
WITH RECHARGER
YES BUT IS THAT HANDY
BUT BUT REMOTE CONTROLS REMOTE CONTROLS NOWADAYS CAN CAN LAST UH TWO YEARS THREE YEARS WITH WITH T TWO BATTERIES
AND THEN YOU
YES
OR
BUT YOU PAY FOR IT
MAYBE LIKE THIS PEN
IT HAS TO FEEL NICE IN YOUR HAND
OH
OH I GOT A NICE LITTLE SCREEN HERE OVER HERE
I GOT LIKE THIS BIG BLACK BORDER UH ON EVERY SIDE
I'LL I'LL FIX IT
YEAH WHATEVER
YES
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ORDER IS
SO
MM-HMM
YES I AGREE
YEAH
YES
YES
I HAVEN'T REALLY FOUND A CONCLUSION LIKE THAT
YEAH
DESIGN
SOUNDS INTERESTING
ALRIGHT
YES
YEAH
IT'S ALRIGHT
UM
ALRIGHT I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH FOR FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
UM YES
THE WORKING METHOD UM THERE WERE HUNDRED UH UH W H ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE UH
HOW DO YOU SAY UH F WATCHED USING REMOTE CONTROLS IN THE USABILITY LAB AND THEY ALSO UH FILLED OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE UH WITH A FEW QUESTIONS
UH I'VE LINED THEM UP HERE
UH ASK WHETHER UM COMMON REMOTE CONTROL LOOKS GOOD OR NOT ABOUT WILLINGNESS TO SPEND MONEY ON REMOTE CONTROL
ABOUT ZAPPING BEHAVIOUR AND UH AND STUFF LIKE THAT
I UH HAVE FOUND SOME INTERESTING THINGS
WE DO WE DO GOT A MARKET
UM THREE OUT OF FOUR PEOPLE CLAIM M UH TO FIND REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
SO IF WE MAKE A TRENDY DESIGN WE SURE HAVE SEVENTY FI SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MARKET WHICH YOU CAN REACH
UM THREE OUT OF FOUR USERS UH ZAPS A LOT AS I UH QUOTED HERE FROM THE UH RESULTS
ZAP BUTTONS ARE USED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES PER HOUR
THAT'S QUITE A LOT
UM
RELEVANT OPTIONS ARE OF COURSE POWER BUTTONS
ALTHOUGH ONLY USED ONCE PER HOUR
UH CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME AND BUTTONS FOR TEXT AND THE MORE UM YEAH
OTHER FUNCTIONS LIKE AUDIO SETTINGS VIDEO SETTINGS SOUND SETTINGS ARE NOT SAID TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND UH VERY MUCH USED
FURTHERMORE FIFTY PERCENT SAYS
UH THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL
THAT DOESN'T SAY WE GOT WE CAN LEAVE NINETY PERCENT OFF
BUT
IT SURE UM SAYS WE SHOULDN'T MAKE IT TOO UH COMPLICATED
FIFTY PERCENT ALSO CLAIMS UH TO HAVE LOST A REMOTE CONTROL VERY OFTEN IN THE ROOM
AND UM AN IMPORTANT THING HERE THE MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS UH
WHICH IS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR MARKET IS IN THE AGE RANGE OF THIRTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD
AND UH ELDERLY PEOPLE OUR MARKET ARE LESS INTERESTED IN UH NICE FEATURES BUT MORE WILLINGLY TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON REMOTE CONTROLS
SO WHAT I WAS THINKING OH WRONG SIDE
WE SHOULDN'T IMPLEMENT TOO MUCH FEATURES ON UH ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE ELDERLY PEOPLE WILL GET TH LOST
GROUP FEATURES FOR A HIGHER USABILITY UH WHAT I WAS CLAIMING IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING
UM ALL THE SETTINGS ABOUT AUDIO SETTINGS VIDEO SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS WHICH ARE NOT VERY OFTEN USED
WE COULD GROUP THEM UH ON ONE BUTTON
AND MAKE THEM ACCESSIBLE UH IN ONE MENU BUTTON OR WHATEVER BECAUSE THEY ARE USED VERY RARELY AND WELL
IT UH THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS THERE SO WE CAN REALLY MAKE UH YEAH HOW DO YOU SAY
WE CAN SPARE AT BUTTONS OVER THERE
AND UM IF YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT V. C. R. AND D. V. D. OPTIONS GROUP THEM IN THE BUTTON NOT TOO UH
YEAH
SMALL BUTTONS SO THEY WON'T BE VERY UM HOW DO YOU SAY
YES WON'T BE VERY PRESENT THANK YOU
AND A TRENDY LOOK WELL UH ALTHOUGH SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET IS UH CONSISTS OF ELDERLY PEOPLE UH WHO DON'T REALLY CARE FOR TRENDY LOOKS OR WHATEVER
I GUESS IT CAN DO NO HARM TO MAKE IT TRENDY FOR THE OTHER THIRTY PERCENT
THAT WAS KIND OF WHAT I FOUND
OKAY
YES
TWO
NO UH I AGREE I AGREE
NOT TOO MUCH NO
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
I DON'T REALLY AGREE ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST
IT'S A VERY SMALL MARKET WHICH WE WILL APPROACH THEN IF WE UH WANT TO REACH CUSTOMERS YOUNGER THAN FORTY
IT'S ONLY LIKE THIRTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MARKET
MAYB YEAH
OKAY
MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN COMPROMISE A LITTLE BIT
NOT TOO MUCH THEN BU ALRIGHT
YES
YEAH I'LL HAVE A LOOK
WE PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
SENSE AND SIMPLICITY
WELL TO BE HONEST IF UM OUR UH AIM GROUP IS UH TILL FORTY
NOT OLDER THAN FORTY MAYBE THAT'S NOT VERY UH YEAH WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO HAVE A SIMPLE REMOTE CONTROL
I THINK WE CAN IMPLEMENT MORE FUNCTIONS THEN BECAUSE UM BASICALLY UH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE MORE ABLE TO ADAPT TO NEW TECHNOLOGY AND THEREFORE WILL BE A MORE
YES
YEAH
WELL I THINK
YES
YEAH CONTROL
NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT
YEP
OR WE CAN U U WE COULD PUT 'EM BEHIND THE FLIP FLAP OR WHATEVER
SO T
YEAH
Y YES
BUT BUT FOR FOR EXAMPLE V. C. R. THAT'S BETTER EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE
I THINK ON A REMOTE CONTROL FOR TELEVISION YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROGRAMME UH THE V. C. R. TO START RECORDING AT THREE P. M. OR WHATEVER
JUST PLAY STOP REWIND AND UH FAST FORWARD
YEAH I KNOW BUT UH
YES
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YES DEFINITELY YEAH
YEAH AND MAYBE TWO OR THREE OTHER OPTIONS BUT NOT NOTHING MORE THAN THAT
I THINK STOP FUNCTION IS VERY USEFUL
IF YOU HAVE A UH A PAGE WHICH CONSISTS OF MORE PAGES AND YOU ARE NOT A VERY QUICK READER
THEN I THINK IT'S VERY IRRITATING IF THE NEXT PAGE SHOWS UP BUT
WELL I USE IT VERY REGULARLY THE ACTION
I RE I USE IT QUITE OFTEN
MIGHT BE
MIGHT BE
I THINK THE PLUS AND THE MINUS BUTTON SHOULD BE UH QUITE PRESENT YEP
YEP
IF YOU GRAB THE REMOTE YOUR HANDS SHOULD BE ON TOP OF THE PLUS
YES
I THINK DOUBLE A.
YEP
THE MOST ORDINARY UH BATTERIES
YEP
I THINK ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES
I THINK THAT'S N THAT'S MORE FOR A FOR AN AGE RANGE OR UH TEN TO TWELVE OR WHATEVER
YEAH YEAH THAT'S GOOD ONE YEP
YE I THINK THE CAN OPENER I IS A BRILLIANT IDEA ACTUALLY BECAUSE TELEVISION AND BEER IS NOT A RARE COMBINATION
YES
YEP
NO THAT'S TRUE
YEAH
YEAH A SWAPABLE FRONT OR WHATEVER
YEAH
YES DEFINITELY DEFINITELY
YES IT IT IT SHOULD BE F BE VISIBLE NEARLY ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM
AS I UH AS I SAID DURING MY PRESENTATION FIFTY PERCENT UH O
YEAH
A FACE
OR UH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN YEP
IF YOU DO THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S POSSIBLE WITHIN THE PRODUCTION COST OF TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
I IN IN THE BASE WE COULD LIKE MAKE UH A BUTTON AND IF YOU PUSH IT THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF S MAKES NOISE
THAT'S PROBABLY STUPID BUT UH AS I FOUND HERE UH FIFTY PERCENT WAS IT FIFTY
UH FIFTY PERCENT
FIFTY PERCENT OFTEN LOSES REMOTE CONTROL
NO UH OF THE BASE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THING YOU PUT IT IN
IF AN A BUTTON IN IN THAT UH
YEAH YOU CAN MA MAKE RECHARGEABLE ONE YEAH
WHY NOT
IT SHOULD ONLY COST TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS OF COURSE
AYE
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
YES
YES DEFINITELY
YEAH
WELL Y YOU YOU COULD CONNECT THAT TO TWO HUNDRED TO TWENTY VOLTS OF COURSE
I DON'T KNOW
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DON'T DO IT WE CAN ALSO MAKE A NICE BAY
I MEAN IT LOOKS TRENDY AND STILL STILL PUT A BLEEP FUNCTION IN IT BUT UM I THINK THE BAY IS DEFINITELY UH
SURE WHY NOT
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
DEFINITELY
WITH EYE CANDY EAR CANDY WHATEVER
YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH
DEFINITELY YEAH
IT WOULD BE NICE YES
MOST TELEVISIONS BREAK DOWN BEFORE THE BATTERY PACK IS EMPTY SO YES
YEAH WHY NOT
HMM
NO THAT'S TRUE
WHY NOT
BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP OH THERE IT IS YEAH
YEAH
NO
NEARLY
YEAH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH
OH
WE'LL SEE
MAARTEN FIVE MINUTES
NO THAT'S TRUE UH YEAH
SHOULD WE BY THE WAY DRAW UM
ON OUR NICE WHITEBOARD UM A LITTLE UH IDEA OF YEAH
I DUNNO
HAS ANYONE GOT UM A LITTLE BIT DETAILED IDEAS ABOUT THE SHAPE
I DON'T FOR ONE
A BIT BIGGER I GUESS BUT
THE SHAPE IS NICE IT'S UM
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND WE WANT WE WANT THAT
YEAH
OKAY YEAH
YEAH BUT TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
UH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS VERY ERGONOMIC
SO
YEAH
YES VOLUME AND PROGRAMME SHOULD BE THERE I GUESS BECAUSE YOU HANDS WI UH Y YOUR HANDS WILL BE IN THE SMALLER PART
YEAH AND THE NUMBERS ON TOP I GUESS
MAYBE RO ROUN ROUNDS UH UH L SORRY
MAYBE LIGHTS ALSO AROUND THE VOLUME AND THE P THE PLUS MINUS PROGRAMME BUTTONS
OH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY YEAH
I THINK I THINK THAT'LL BE TOO BIG THA TOO BIG THEN
YEAH
YES WE ARE
ALRIGHT
YES I GUESS IT'S LUNCH TIME
I DON'T KNOW
HALF AND HOUR
I THOUGHT OUR NEXT UH NEXT INDIVIDUAL ROUND WAS HALF AN HOUR
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE LUNCH BREAK
WELL
OKAY ALL SET
WELCOME TO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN MEETING
THE AGENDA
THE OPENING
I'LL AGAIN BE THE SECRETARY AND MAKE MINUTES TAKE MINUTES UH AND IT WILL BE THREE PRESENTATIONS JUST LIKE THE LAST MEETING
SO UM WHO WANTS TO START OFF
TECHNICAL UH DESIGNER AGAIN
OKAY
UH YEAH
UH BEFORE WE BEGIN IT I WANT TO SAY I'VE I'VE PUT THE MINUTES OF THE UH SECOND MEETING IN THE SHARED FOLDER
BUT THEY'RE STILL NOT UH QUITE OKAY
IT UH IT UH STILL SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES SO THE THE FIRST PART OF THE MINUTES ARE VERY HARD TO READ
BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO DOCUMENTS THAT UH WERE LAYERED OVER EACH OTHER
SO BUT UH FROM NOW ON I WON'T USE MY PEN ANYMORE SO WILL BE P JUST ORDINARY KEYBOARD
I THINK IT WILL
WILL BE MORE UH EASY FOR YOU TO READ THE MINUTES
TWELVE AND A HALF
ACTUALLY
WHAT ARE THOSE T TOOTH UH BRUSHES OR SO
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF UH WELL IT RESEMBLES THE DESIGN I HAD IN MIND FOR THIS PROJ YOU KNOW THE THE CARTOONISH ALESSI KIND OF DESIGN
AND WE CAN WE CAN STEAL THEIR IDEAS
HUH
WELL IT'S A POSSIBILITY TOO
UH UH
OKAY
NEXT TIME WE'RE HERE
OH OKAY
OKAY
OH WE DECIDED UPON THAT IN THE LAST MEETING
DIDN'T WE
OH OKAY
WELL THA I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS OR SOMETHI JUST NO BUT WE DECIDED TO USE ONLY B BASIC FUNCTIONS ONLY
OKAY
WELL WE MAYBE WE CAN THINK OF THAT LATER
W JUST THESE ARE THE ONES YOU ALREADY SUMMED UP IN THE
OKAY
YEAH
THAT MIGHT GET REDUNDANT ALSO MAYBE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IT WOULD
YEAH
YEAH IT'S OKAY
OKAY
THAT'S NOT
IT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA
OKAY
NO
NO
BUT YOU DO MENTION THE NEXT AND PREVIOUS UH BUTTON
OH OKAY O OKAY OKAY
HUH
MM-HMM
WELL W WHEN WE ONLY USE BASIC FUNCTIONS WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO MAKE THE BUTTONS LARGER
WELL I THINK WE ALREADY AGREED UPON THE FACT THAT THE THE THE SKIP BUTTONS AND THE CHA AND THE VOLUME BUTTONS
TH TH THOSE TWO HAVE YEAH THEY HAVE TO BE LARGE
UH I MEAN TH TH THE THE TWO TWO BASIC BUTTONS YOU KNOW THE TO SKIP CHANNELS AND TO UH
I THINK YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I THINK THAT IS THAT'S T TRENDY TOO BECAUSE THAT'S THE MO IT IT YOU KNOW
IT'S UH ACC ACC UM ACCENTU UH HOW DO YOU SAY IT
IT PUTS AN EXTRA ACCENT ON THE THE ON THE SIMPLICITY OF OUR REMOTES TO J TO MAKE THESE TWO MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS EXTRA BIG LIKE T
YEAH
AND YOU WANT TO ACC ACCENTUATE THAT YOU KNOW
SO
OKAY
NO UH THAT'S COO IT'S COOL
WELL MAYBE C THEN WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH SPONGE BOB THEN
IT DOESN'T STROKE WITH THE WITH THE DARK COLOURS
NOT THE DARK COLOURS
OKAY
OKAY
FOR DIVERSITY OR SOMETHING
UH
NO BUT I I I THINK THAT UH OUR DESIGN ALREADY RESEMBLES SO A PIECE OF FRUIT
IT'S LIKE A PEAR OR SOMETHING
NO I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO DO IT LIKE
YEAH BUT IT THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU YOU KNOW LIKE EXPLICITLY OF S OUR F OF A OF A SPECIFIC PIECE OF FRUIT
BUT JUST YOU KNOW LIKE THE THE THE THE ROUND CURVES
AND SO Y I I THINK THIS Y IT ALREADY SEM RESEMBLES UH SOMETHING LIKE A PEAR TO ME OR SOMETHING
YEAH
YOU DO GET THE IDEA EH
THE FRUITY KIND OF ROUND 'KAY
YEAH UH YEAH I DON'T KNOW
UH THIS IS A B YEAH
YEAH YEAH
OF COURSE WE HAVE UH
WE HAVE A VERY BIG UH THE S
OF D DESIGN TEAM YEAH
YEAH BUT
IT'S PEAR I GUESS
NO
NO BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S ALREADY WHAT WE WERE WERE UP TO
UH IT'S IT DOESN'T HAVE TO RESEMBLE UH WHAT I ALREADY SAID
A SPECIFIC PIECE OF FRUIT BUT JUST YOU KNOW LIKE A FRUITY THING GOING ON
AND IT'S IT LOOKS FRUITY TO ME
AND UH BUT I DO LIKE THE YEAH I DO LIKE UH THE F UH TO THE IDEA OF MAKING A A Y UH
A CATCHY COLOUR DESIGN AND A D BECAUSE I DO I THINK A DARK COLOUR WOULD BE NICE TOO
MAYBE IT'S TOO MUCH YOU KNOW
OKAY BUT WHAT ARE THE THIS IS YELLOW
BUT I DON'T THINK OUR OUR COMPANY COLOURS ARE THIS FASHIONABLE
YEAH ON UH N UH ON THE BOTTOM OF THE REMOTE YOU CAN DO
OKAY
OKAY YOU CAN YOU OPEN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PRESENTATION
SEE WHAT WAS ON THE AGENDA
THIS IS HIS OWN REMOTE
BECAUSE UM MAYBE WE CAN START WITH THE TECHNICAL UH FUNCTIONS
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THERE UH YEAH UM DO WE WANT TO UM USE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY FOR EXAMPLE
ME NEITHER
YEAH BUT IT'S SO
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO IT
YEAH BUT NO
I DO I THINK IT'S A BIT REDUNDANT ACTUALLY
AND IT'S ALSO NOT I DON'T TH EVEN THINK IT IT LOOKS S LIKE SEXY OR SOMETHING IT'S
BUT YOU'RE ALREADY WATCHING THE T. V. YOU'RE NOT GONNA WATCH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
I REALLY UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR JOB MORE EXCITING BY PUTTING AN L. C. D. IN IT
BUT I I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD N GOO BECAUSE IT ALSO DOESN'T STROKE WITH WE WANTED UH C WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MATERIALS
UH IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO USE THESE PLASTIC MATERIALS WITH SOFT RUBBER STUFF ON IT
IT WAS OUR IDEA YOU KNOW TO GIVE IT A MORE STURDY LOOK AND THAT YOU CA LIKE YOU CAN THROW WITH IT
BUT I DON'T THINK A L. C. D. DISPLAY FITS IN THAT IMAGE
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE MORE VULNERABLE AND IT ADDS NOTHING REALLY YOU KNOW
YEAH YEAH
YOU COULD MAKE IT BUT IT'S JUST IT IT DOESN'T I DON'T THINK IT IT'S COHERENT WITH THE DESIGN WE'RE AFTER
BUT THAT'S MY OPINION
WELL YOU YOU Y OKAY WE CAN VOTE FOR IT
YOU WANT THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
I DON'T WANT TO AND HE DOESN'T SO IT'S UP TO HIM
IF WE WANNA
AND I'VE READ SOMEWHERE THAT I'VE GOT SOME KIND OF VETO VETO UH RIGHTS
SO I CAN ALSO SAY
BUT DID WE SKIP THE YEAH YOU COULD DO M BUT WHAT WHAT I SO WHAT I BUT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHAT WHAT INFORMATION WE WANT TO DISPLAY ON IT
SO
NAH THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK
YEAH
OH WELL UH I'VE SEEN IT DONE BEFORE
DO YOU KNOW TH LIKE THE THE BIGGER REM UH UNIVERSAL REMOTES THEY HAVE D L. C. D. DISPLAYS
BUT THEN IT'S VERY FUNCTIONAL TO INDICATE WHICH WHAT UH UH DEVICE YOU ARE CONTROLLING
SO IT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN
BUT IT JUST IT J IT DOESN'T DOESN'T MATCH WITH THE OUR WHOLE BASIC CONCEPT
WELL YEAH YEAH OKAY
THAT'S MAYBE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT BUT IT'S JUST
I DON'T THINK SO
YEAH WELL DO YOU HA DO YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AFTER THE TRENDINESS OF L. C. D. DISPLAYS HAVE YOU
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT WE'RE GONNA IF IT
THEN UH THEN YOU BETTER DON'T YEAH D
UH UH I REALLY DON'T FEEL THE WHOLE IDEA OF AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
I'M SORRY
IT CAN'T CO YOU CANNOT CONVINCE ME
I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL HOW TO WITH YOU GUYS BUT
I DON'T REALLY FEEL IT
WE ALREADY WE'RE UH YEAH WE ALREADY HAVE THE THE TH TH TH BASE STATION GADGETS
AND WANT AND IT UH UH DO IT HAS TO BE A SIMPLE DESIGN WHICH STURDY WHICH SOFT
I DON'T THINK
I J UH AND REALLY I DON'T SEE HOW THE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY IS GONNA ADD ANYTHING YOU KNOW ON A DESIGN LEVEL
UH I THINK IT'S SLICKER TO HAVE NO L. CEDS
Y WE WANT TO IT'S SIMPLICITY
W YOU HAVE TWO BIG BUTTONS AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THESE TWO BUTTONS SO YOU DON'T NEED AN L. C. D.
IT DOESN'T FIT IN OUR PHILOSOPHY UH BEHIND THE WHOLE REMOTE
YEAH BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE DOCKING STATION WHICH IS
IT HAS TO BE DEVELOPED BUT NO BUT IT THAT'S THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR KILLER FEATURE
THAT'S OUR WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL
YEAH WE'RE GONNA DEVELOP OUR OWN R N DOCKING STATION
UH BUT RE WE REALLY HAVE TO CUT THIS OFF
I RE I KNOW YOU I I I I I GET THE IDEA YOU REALLY LIKE IT YOU KNOW
THE THE L. C. D. THING BUT I I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA AND WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED ALL THE ARGUMENTS
I DON'T UH DO YOU GUYS AGRE HOW DO YOU GUYS THINK
I D
OKAY WE S SKIP THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
I'M SORRY MAYBE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING IF WE ARE AT YOUR OWN PLACE OR MAKE IT MAKE IT MAKE IT HAPPEN IN YOUR BASEMENT OR SOMETHING
BUT
PROBABLY SO
OKAY
BUT FOR THE TECHNICAL PART
THE M MATERIAL I THINK UH IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO USE THE PLASTIC AND UH THE RUBBER
UH
YEAH YEAH YEAH P EXACTLY
THIS IS WHAT IT W YEAH BUT IT IT WAS ALREADY WHAT WE'RE UH WE'RE AFTER
YOU KNOW TO GIVE IT UH YOU KNOW THE SOFT TOUCH IN YOUR HANDS AND ALSO TO
KNOW LIKE YEAH THAT IS Y THE B AIRBAG KIND OF THING
YOU CAN ST THROW IT AT YOUR LITTLE BROTHER'S HEAD
YEAH
NO NO NO NOT THAT COMFY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD POINT
AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE DARK T COL DARK COLOUR BIT YOU KNOW
BECAUSE IT MAY BE THE DESIGN UH IT'S UH MAYBE IT IS A BIT OF THE
IT'S A BIT NINETIES MAYBE WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE UP TO RAT FUN TO THIS POINT
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S TRUE BUT BUT IT HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIG SOLID
IT MUSTN'T BE TOO N YOU KNOW TH TOO OVERWHELMING THEN WHEN YOU PUT IT ON YOUR JUST
YEAH
YEAH MAYBE SO
NO UH I DON'T LIKE THE YELLOW AND BLACK COMBINATION
BUT IT IS OUR COMPANY COLOURS
APPARENTLY
I DON'T LIKE YELLOW AND UH MAYBE I DON'T KNOW
BUT
OKAY BUT WHAT UH WHAT ARE OTHER TEF TECHNICAL THINGS WE HAVE TO DISCUSS
SHOULD WE DO THAT
I DON'T THINK YOU WE SHOULD DO THAT
MAYBE JUST BRING IT OUT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS BUT NOT AF THAT YOU CAN SWITCH FRONTS AFTERWARDS THAT'S ALSO TOO MUCH
PEOPLE DON'T WANNA SPEND MORE MONEY ON THEIR REMOTE CONTROL I GUESS
YEAH YEAH
BUT UH WITHOUT GON UH OKAY
SO ARE WE THROUGH THE TECHNICAL PART THEN
OKAY
SO WE UH AGREED UPON UH N UH WELL NOT U UNANIMOUSLY OR HOW YOU CALL IT BUT YEAH
THE MATERIALS YOU UH MENTIONED IN YOUR YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES WERE ALL WERE QUITE OKAY
O O ONLY ONLY THE LAST POINT YOUR NO TITANIUM'S NOT NOT OUT OF QUESTION I GUESS
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE BOTH THE THE PLASTIC AND SO UH SOFT THINGS AND T P TITANIUM AS WELL
MAKES IT IN A HOMOGENEOUS UH DESIGN
IT WILL IT WILL BREAK OTHER STUFF W WHEN IT'S PLASTIC AS WELL
YEAH
NO BUT UH UH YOU SHOULD MA YEAH
OKAY THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES AND MAKE IT IN COMPLETELY TITANIUM
WELL WOULD IT BE MORE TRENDY
MORE CHIC
YEAH BUT I I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF THE THE THE PLASTIC AND THE BIG KIND OF THING
BUT THE QUESTION IS I THEN IT'S YOU KNOW
IS IS IT FITS IN OUR S PHILOSOPHY TO MAKE IT UH STURDY AND SIMPLE AND UH KNOW LIKE UH
WHEN YOU MAKE IT TITANIUM IT BECOMES MORE LIKE SOME KIND OF GADGET YOU ACTUALLY DON'T NEED
AND WHEN IT'S BIG AND PLASTIC IT'S LIKE SOME FUN STUFF YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE AROUND
IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO HAVE SOMETHING BIG AND PLASTIC AROUND
YEAH THAT'S BEAUTIFUL
OH MAYBE TH MAYBE THIS IS AN
NO I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF MAYBE A T TITANIUM KIND TYPE OF BODY W AND THEN WITH S PLASTIC COLOURATION AROUND IT
YOU KNOW LIKE THE THE SOFT STUFF BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE THE PLASTIC GIVE UH THE TI TITANIUM LOOK
BUT MAKE IT JUST LIKE SHINY
MAYBE WE SHOULD UH SHOU
AND UH AND
MAYBE WE SH SHOULD WE T I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT UH HOW HOW MUCH TIME HAVE WE GOT LEFT
FORTY MINUTES
OKAY
YOU PUTTING IN DIFFERENT COLOURS
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH BUT W YEAH
WELL IT IS
IT'S A POSSIBILITY
BUT LET'S THINK ABOUT THE BAS
MM-HMM MM-HMM
BUT WHA TH OUR BASIC IDEA Y I MEAN YOU GONNA WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE LIKE TWO TYPE OF MATERIALS
LIKE THE D D B THE PLASTIC UH ENCLOSURE AND THEN THE THE PADS THAT SURROUND IT
AND AND PRO AND LIGHTS
WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE THE LIGHTS TOO
BUT UH DO W GONNA GONNA ARE WE GOING TO GIVE IT A TWO TONE COLOUR LOOK
LIKE THE THE PLASTIC MOULD IS IN IN ONE COLOUR AND THE S THE CUSHION PADS AROUND IT ARE IN ANOTHER COLOUR
IS THAT THE IDEA
IS THAT A GOOD IDEA
HOW MANY COLOURS ARE WE HOW MANY COLOURS ARE WE GONNA WE'RE UH UH F UH F ONLY FIVE MINUTES LEFT BY THE WAY
HOW MANY COLOURS ARE WE GONNA GIVE IT
LIKE TWO TONE COLOUR
T
I THINK MAYBE THE CASE ITSELF SHOULD BE IN ONE COLOUR AND THEN THE RUBBER OF THE BUTTONS AND THE CUSHIONS AS WELL SHOULD BE IN ANOTHER COLOUR
OKAY BUT NOT MORE THAN WELL YEAH IT'S NO
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT ON A L IN A LATER MEETING
OKAY
BUT WE HAVE TO UH THINK OF SOME OTHER UH IMPORTANT THINGS
UH OH YEAH THE THE FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE THE BUTTONS
NO
I THINK THIS IS OKAY THE SO WE HAVE THE BASIC
THEN WE HAVE THE NUMBERS
WE HAVE THE POWER BUTTON
WE HAVE WE HAVE A TELETEXT BUTTON
AND MAYBE WANT TO ACCESS A A MENU OR SOMETHING
MOST T. V. S HAVE A MENU
YEAH BUT I THINK YOU HA I REALLY NEED A MENU BUTTON
THAT'S JUST I THE ONLY BUTTON ONLY
YOU KNOW I
NO I THINK MOST T. V. S HAVE AN UH A MENU NOWADAYS TO ACCESS THE UH UH SCREEN SETTINGS
AND SO
BUT THAT THAT COVERS ALL THE ALL THE OTHER SETTINGS
IT COVERS EVERYTHING THEN
NO YOU CAN USE THE
AND YOU AL CAN ALSO USE THE NORMAL SKIP BUTTONS FOR THAT
TH IN THAT WAY WE HAVE LIKE ONLY THE NUMBERS THE POWER BUTTON SKIP AND VOLUME AND THEN UH UH TEN UH REM UH YEAH MUTE
A TELETEXT AND A MENU AND THEN THEN I THAT'S IT
IT'S ALL WE NEED
OKAY UH ANOTHER STUF SOME STUFF ABOUT THE THE THE DESIGN OF THE DOCKING STATION
SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT A S UH NO UH WHICH SH UH SHOULD REMIND US OF THE REMOTE ITSELF I GUESS
UH IN ONE COLOUR
JUST USE
I THINK THE SPONGY THING ALREADY UM COMES FORWARD IN THE IN THE IN THE CUSHIONS PADS AND THINGS ON THE S UH SIDE
AND WE WILL MAKE IT SPONGY AND AND UH AND UH WELL
THE FRUITY THING IS JUST THE SHAPE SHOULD BE FRU I DID I THINK THIS IS KIND OF FRUITY YOU KNOW
JUST ROUND SHAPES WITH UH
YEAH BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK I THINK COLOURS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE FLASHY
BUT AND BUT IT D IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANNOYING THAT WHEN YOU UH KNOW SOME THINGS IS JUST OVER THE TOP
AND WHEN YOU HAVE IT ON YOUR TABLE FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS YOU IT JUST GETS ANNOYING BECAUSE IT'S SO BIG AND FLASHY
UH IT HAS TO BE SOME LEVEL OF SUBTLETY BUT WE HAVE TO STILL HAVE TO THINK OF HOW WE MANAGE TO UH
TO GET TO THAT
OKAY
GUESS WE'RE THROUGH THEN
BUT WE I THINK ALSO WE JUST SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH COLOUR BUT ALSO
I I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THE DARK COLOUR THING IN MIND
I THINK THAT'S UH ADDS TO THE TOO MUCH COLOUR MAYBE M UM
BUT OUR DES DESIGN EXPERTS WILL UH WORK THAT OUT
OKAY WELL I THINK THE MEETING WILL BE OVER WITHIN A MINUTE
SO WE WILL WRAP UP
OR IS THERE ANYTHING WE'D LIKE TO DISCUSS
THAT'S RIGHT
OKAY
OKAY
WELL YOU WILL READ THE MINUTES UH IN THE YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THE PRO PROBABLY
YEAH UH NO FOR SU FOR SURE BECAUSE I'M WILL NOW TYPE THEM OUT
UH Y YEAH
I THINK UH
BUT TOILET PAPER ROLL AND UH
OKAY
YEP
I WAS WAITING FOR THE L LAST MESSAGE BUT
MM YEAH
UH OKAY
AGAIN
HMM
MM-HMM
UH MAY BE BETTER YEAH
YEAH
OH
OH TITANIUM IS
PROBABLY TRENDY I THINK
WELL MAYBE A LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE
I DON'T KNOW
YEAH PRODUCTION COST
I
DIFFERENT COLOURS ALSO
YEAH
OKAY
UH
AH
WELL I SHALL GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
UM
UM I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT USER REQUIREMENTS
I WAS THINKING ABOUT JUST UH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS AND I GOT UH
YEAH BUT BUT THEN WH I DON'T KNOW WHEN THERE ARE NEW USER REQUIREMENTS
I HA I HA I HAVE THE I HAVE
NOTHING
WELL I HAVE HERE A COUPLE OF BASIC FUNCTIONS I COULD THINK OF
I DUNNO IF THEY'RE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT
YEAH
YEAH I I UH WELL I POINTED THEM OUT HERE JUST TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER
UM
ANOTHER FUNCTION UH IS OF COURSE WE ALREADY DISCUSS IT ON THE SIDE
UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT COSTS OF IT
UH I'VE NO IDEA ABOUT IT
UH I WAS ALSO LOOKING FOR WHAT YOU SAID FOR I GOT AN EMAIL UH UH ABOUT UH L. C. D. IN IN IN FRONT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA OR MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE BIT
TOO MUCH FOR TWELVE AND A HALF
PRODUCTION
IF WE GOT ALREADY UH SOMETHING LIKE A BASE
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
I D I UH JU I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT
THEN I GOT A POP UPS TO GO TO THE MEETING
BUT
THE REMOTE CONTROL
A LITTLE UH TOO A LITTLE BIT
A LITTLE BIT TOO BIG I THINK
EXACTLY
UM YEAH
WELL THE FUNCTIONS ARE ARE NOT MORE TO DISCUSS I THINK
IT'S IT'S JUST THE BASE THINGS WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT THE NO V. C. R. OR THAT KIND OF UH SO THAT'S VERY EASY
UM
MM-HMM
WELL THAT'S NEXT CHANNEL
I MEAN NEXT CHANNEL
UH
UM OH I I GOT AN EMAIL WITH WITH AN UH A REMOTE CONTROL WITH A BASE
SO IT'S UH JUST AN IDEA
AND I UM
UH THINKED OF THE BUTTON SIZES AND I'M NOT SURE UH IF THEY HAVE TO BE BIG OR UH JUST SMALL
WELL I'M NOT A E I'M THE EXPERT FOR USER FRIENDLY BUT NOT FOR TRENDINESS
MAYBE IT
WELL UH OKAY THAT'S YOUR POINT
UM YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH I'VE NOTHING TO S
UH WITH A LITTLE BIT LARGER YEAH
I THOUGHT SO BUT MAYBE WITH THE
YEAH THAT GROUPS
LARGE
YEAH
MOST THE MOST USED UH BUTTONS
TRUE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UH THAT WAS ALL Y UH PERSONAL PREFERENCE I DIDN'T HAVE
I DIDN'T HAD ANY TIME LEFT
SO YEAH
IT'S THERE
YEAH CLICK ON IT
COUPLE TIME
WELL HOW UH
BUT HOW DO WE USE UH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN CHRIST'S SAKE WITH REMOTE CONTROL
UH MAKE IT A BANANA
YEAH BUT TH YEAH BUT THAT
YEAH BUT THAT'S
YEAH UH UH
BUT D DON'T WE NEED A CREATIVE ARTIST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO M MAKE IT TO FEEL LIKE A A A A VEGETABLE OR FRUIT
YEAH
BUT WE WE HAVE TO UM THERE HAVE TO BE THE THE THE THE FIRM COLOURS OUR OWN UH COLOURS HAS TO BE IN IT
YELLOW A REAL REACTION
UH YEAH
WE UH F
A YELLOW DO
UH YEAH
YEAH AND THE BUTTON THEN
OKAY YEAH
OKAY
LAZY
YEAH
WELL WELL WHAT WOULD YOU DISPLAY ON IT THEN
BUT IS IT ISN'T THAT A ALREADY ON T. V. A LOT OF NEW T. V. S
YEAH
YEAH AND WE ALSO HAVE TO YEAH
AND I ALSO
YEAH I DUNNO
OH OKAY
WE CAN YOU AWAY
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
UH UH I I IF IT'S IT'S A SIMPLE P
NO THAT THAT'S RIGHT AND UH I ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT NEW FUNCTIONS MAYBE BUTTONS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO CONTROL IT
KIND OF L. C. D. OR SOMETHING OR
BUT HOW DOES IT DISPLAY THEN
W WHEN I GO TO THE SECOND CHANNEL WHAT WHAT DOES IT SHOW ME
ABOUT THAT PROGRAMME
YEAH
IS IT FASHION
I DON'T KNOW
THAT'S NOT UP TO YOU
THAT'S UP TO MARKET IF I IF IT'S TRENDY
BECAUSE OUR OUR MOTTO IS WE PUT FASHION
YEAH IF YOU WANT TO BE TRENDY YOU HAVE TO BE COLOURED
COLOURED
IF YOU HAVE BLACK AND WHITE OR SOMETHING OR GREY THAT'S
IT'S TOO MUCH UH MAYBE UH WITH WITH THE L. C. D. AND THE DOCKING STATION AND
WITH ONE THING SPECIAL
NOT A WHOLE PACKAGE OF SPECIALTY
AND UH THE
YEAH
IT'S JUST AN IT'S JUST AN IDEA
IT'S A IT'S
TRUE
WELL UH I UH
YEAH I DUNNO
NO IT'S TOO MUCH
IT'S OVERDONE
DEMOCRATICALLY
WITH A SPONGY BOB FEEL
YEAH
YEAH YOU JUST CAN DROP IT
YEAH
YEAH
BUT NOT BLACK I THINK
WELL IF IF IT'S FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IT HAVE TO BE COLOURFUL
BUT CAN WE GE UH UH
CAN WE COMBINE IT OR SOMETHING
UH WITH UH YELLOW AND BLACK
MAKE IT A BEE
A BEE
YEAH IT'S OUR YEAH
WE WE HAVE TO USE YELLOW
DIFFERENT FRONTS
YEAH
UH YOU CAN YOU CAN L UH LET CHOOSE THE CUSTOMER WHICH COLOUR HE WANTS YEAH
YEAH THREE THREE OR FOUR UH FOUR UH COLOURS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL YEAH THE
THREE TO ONE
THAT'S
AND TITA UH TITANIUM IS UH IS IS IT A NO
IS
IT'S JUST LIKE THAT TH THIS TITANIUM
NO NOT ALL NOT ALL OF THEM
UH I THINK TITANIUM NOWADAYS IS WAY MORE OFTEN USED THAN PLASTIC
IN TRENDY THINGS
YEAH
IT'S COLD IN THE WINTER
YEAH
YOU HAVE THAT UH M. P. THREE PLAYER OF NIKE I SAW
ISN'T THAT TITANIUM WITH A LITTLE BIT OF RUBBER
ISN'T IT
IS PLASTIC
WELL IT'S TITANIUM LOOKING
YEAH HE IS
HERE HE IS
UH THE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THE M. P. THREE PLAYER OF NIKE
'KAY UH THAT THAT'S VERY UH WITH RUBBER SO IT'S VERY
ROUGH
TRUE
YEAH YEAH TRUE
YEAH MAYBE THAT'S GOOD IDEA YEAH
BUT IF YOU WANT TO LA UH YEAH LAST LONGER THAN TWO WEEKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN MAYBE
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TIME DOES
THE RUBBER
YEAH
UH NO NOT TOO MUCH I THINK
OR YOU JUST MAKE UH ONE COLOUR UH MAYBE WITH A A Z A KIND OF LIKE A BIG WAVE OR SOMETHING LIKE UH
IN IN ANOTHER COLOUR
NOT MORE THAN TWO COLOURS I THINK
IT'S A G A LITTLE BIT TOO FLASHY
THE FUNCT YEAH I WAS I WAS THINKING ABOUT TH THE ST DO WE STILL WANT A JOYSTICK IDEA
YEAH
THE VOLUME TELETEXT AND
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH B
YEAH BUT WHA WHAT KIND OF MENU
IS UH ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM EVERY TELEVISION
MUTE
YEAH
OKAY THAT'S NOT MU NOT MUCH FUNCTIONS
SO
OKAY
YEAH
TOO MUCH COLOUR I IT UH WHEN YOU GOT IT IN A LIVING ROOM IT'S TOO MUCH MAYBE
IT HAS TO BE
YEAH
NO
OH OKAY YEAH
YEAH
I HOPE SO
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE KIND OF PROTOTYPE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU SEE A KINDA PROTOTYPE YOU CAN A LITTLE BIT MORE UH
YEAH
WITH YOU LAPTOP
YEAH
OH MY GOD
WELL YOU ARE
WE'RE NOT
YES
OKAY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UH COMPONENTS DESIGN
UM IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE MATERIAL AND THE AND UH UH REALLY THE STUFF WE BUILD UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS OF
UM A REMOTE CONTROL CONSIST OF UH COMPONENTS AND THE COMPONENTS OF A REMOTE CONTROL CONSIST OF UH PROPERTIES AND MATERIAL
WE HAVE TO CHOOSE TH UH THESE UH WISELY AND IT COULD AFFECT UH UH A KIND OF GROW OF IN UH IN BUYING UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS
UM THE COMPONENTS OF A REMOTE CONTROL ARE OF COURSE UH THE CASE
UH THE PROPERTIES OF THE CASE
UM IT HAS TO BE SOLID UH IN HARD MATERIAL LIKE UH HARD PLASTIC UH WITH SOFT RUBBER FOR UH FALLING AND AND UH UH YEAH
IT FEELS UH GOOD IN YOUR HAND
MM THE BUTTONS HAS TO BE UH SOLID TOO AND THE MATERIAL IS SOFT RUBBER
UH I'VE GOT A UH EMAIL FROM THE POSSIBILITIES OF REAL REACTION
UM
UH THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT UM WHEN WE BUILD UH A REMOTE CONTROL OF UM OF PLASTIC OR RUBBER THE UH BUTTONS HAVE TO BE UH RUBBER TOO
MM
IT'S OKAY
YEAH
I WHEN WE USE A RUBBLED A DOUBLED CURVED CASE
WE MUST USE A RUBBER PUSH BUTTONS TO UH THE THE RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED CASE IS A IS A T UH THREE DIMENSIONAL UH CURVE IN THE IN THE DESIGN
WHICH IS UH NECESSARY WHEN WE WANT TO BE TRENDY
UH
UM
THE ENERGY SOURCE UH I'VE GOT A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES FOR THAT TOO
UM
UH THE BASIC BATTERY WHICH I THI PREFER BECAUSE OF ITS UH ITS NON UH NON DEPENDING OF OF OF UH UM
UH HERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HAND UH YEAH KINETIC UH
ENERGY
ALSO IN UH THIS ONE LIKE IN THE WATCHES BUT A REMOTE CONTROL CAN LIE ON A TABLE FOR A DAY
AND THEN YOU PUSH UH A BUTTON AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO UH WALK WITH IT ALL THE ALL THE TIME
MM SOLAR CELLS ARE ALSO UH A BIT WEIRD FOR UH REMOTE CONTROLS
UM
UH ALSO THE CASE MATERIAL UH I THINK THAT PLASTIC IS THE IS THE BEST WITH RUBBER BECAUSE UH WOOD OR TITANIUM
WOULD ALSO BE A BIT WEIRD
UH THEY DON'T TELL ANYTHING ABOUT THE COST OF UH TITANIUM
UM
THE CHIP UH THE CHIP SET UH AND THE BOARD IS UH ALL OFF THE SHELF
ALSO THE SPEAKER IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN WE WANT TO RETRIEVE IT
UM THE BASE STATION IS ALSO OFF THE SHELF ALL THE MATERIALS AND THE
COMPONENTS ARE UH JUST AVAILABLE IN UH
IN OUR UH FACTORY
MM
I'VE TOLD ABOUT UH THE THREE FIRST POINTS
MM THE SIMPLE ELECTRONICAL CHIP UH IS IS AVAILABLE UH WITH THE LED TRANSMITTER UH TRANSMITTER
UH IT'S ALL UH OFF THE SHELF AND EVEN THE SPEAKER AND THE WIRELESS RETRIEVER ARE ALL UH AVAILABLE IN OUR COMPANY
UM ANOTHER POSSIBILITY
I UH
YEAH I LOOKED UP ON WAS UH THE L. C. D. DISPLAYS
COULD BE UH
SOMETHING SPECIAL TO OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT ONLY COST A BIT MORE
BUT MAYBE IT CAN BE UH WITHIN THE LIMITS OF TWENTY FIVE EUROS
AH YEAH
I TH I GOT AN EMAIL WITH UH SOME EXAMPLES AND IT THESE WERE WERE THE MOST TRENDIEST ONE
YOU SEE UH A COVERS WHICH CAN BE
UM I DON'T KNOW
UM
YES
YES MAYBE WE CAN UH BRI UH BRING A COUPLE OF UH COUPLE OF TYPES OF UH MAYBE A KIND OF UH WHOLE UH
UM
A WHOLE SET OF UH DIFFERENT UH REMOTE CONTROLS
MAYBE WE CAN BRING A WHOLE LINE UH WITH UH
WITH A HUGE VARIETY OF UH
UH HOUSE UH STUFF
LIKE UH MAYBE RADIOS AND UH TELEVISION ALSO UH IN THIS IN THIS IN THE SAME STYLE BUT
YES BECAUSE WE HAVE TO UH WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO BRING THE LOGO AND ALL THE STUFF UH BACK INTO IT
THANK YOU
UH-HUH
MAYBE WE CAN BRING T UH UH TELETEXT TO THE T TO THE REMOTE CONTROL
BUT YOU'RE THE EXPERT
YOU DID THE RESEARCH
IT'S FROM YOUR RESEARCH
GRAPES
FOR A BIG TEAM OF ARTISTS
BUT UH BUT I THINK WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
WE CAN'T MAKE ALL UH TEN DESIGNS
WE HAVE TO MAKE ONE DESIGN I TH I I THINK
BUT PICTURES OF FRUIT VEGETABLES VEGETABLES
YES YOU CAN PUT A LOGO ON TOP OF IT
YES IT'S REALLY FRUITY
WITH A STRAWBERRY ON TOP
ONLY IF WE
MAYBE MAYBE WE CAN MAKE A T. V. GUIDE ON IT FOR THE CHANNEL YOU'RE ON
NO NO ONLY THE T. V. CHANNEL WITH THE WITH UH WITH UH FOUR PROGRAMMES
YOU CAN UH ZAP THROUGH THEM WITH THE PAGE UP PAGE DOWN BUTTON
YES IT CAN
ON YOUR
NO ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN Y YOU CAN READ TEXT ALSO
SO WHY NOT ON YOUR REMOTE
UH PROGRAMME UH INFORMATION OR OR OR OR G OR A GUIDE
ON T ON TELETEXT YES
ALSO ON THE INTERNET
BUT
YES BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S NEXT
YES THAT'S UH REALLY POSSIBLE
NO
NO UH UM
Y YES YOU CAN USE UH BUTTONS UH UH W THAT ARE ALREADY UH ON THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR DOUBLE FUNCTIONS
UH THEN YOU PUSH A BUTTON
THE TITLE AND THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAMME
BUT BUT UH YEAH WHAT HE SAID WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE TELEVISIONS THEY HAVE TO BE UH CUSTOMISED TO THE
BUT MAYBE IN FUTURE IT WILL BE A GIANT HIT AND WHEN YOU ARE THE FIRST
YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST UH
YES YOU CAN PUT UH A LITTLE L. C. D. DISPLAY ON IT WITH UH WITH LOTS OF INFORMATION
BUT UH I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT
BUT WHE BUT WHEN YOU PUT A A A TRANSPARENT UH PLASTIC UH
UH SCREEN ON TOP OF IT IT I IT ISN'T VULNERABLE
YOU CAN THROW WITH IT AND
WHEN WHEN YOU PUT UH MAYBE A COLOUR L. C. D. T UH SCREEN ON IT IT'S VERY SPECIAL AND VERY TRENDY TO HAVE UH A REMOTE CONTROL FROM
BUT UH I'VE GOT A THE EMAIL WITH UH WITH THE POSSIBILITIES
AND L. C. D. WAS A POSSIBILITY FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO WHY DON'T WE USE IT
NO BUT IT DOESN'T SA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A COLOUR OR BUT MM
I ALF I ALSO GOT A POSSIBILITY TO PUT UH A SCROLL BUTTON ON IT
BUT
I DIDN'T THINK THAT
YES BUT O ON THE
NO WHEN Y
BUT IT LOOK
YES BUT THAT REMOTE CONTROLS ARE ALREADY ON THE MARKET
THE SIMPLE
YES BUT BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL
YES BUT YOU HAD A PICTURE OF IT FROM ANOTHER COMPANY
YES IT WAS ALREADY MADE
THA THE REMOTE CONTROL ON THE DOCKING STATION
YES HE HAVE A PICTURE OF IT
OKAY
MAYB
I WILL RULE THE WORLD WITH IT
YES MAYBE A BIT OF A CUSHION IS
YES
LIKE A B YES
MAYBE IT BUT THEN WE HAVE TO LOOK THAT IT UH W UH WILL NOT UM BE TOO CHILDISH TO SEE
YES REAL REAL GOOD COLOURS
HMM
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY FRUITY
UH FRONTS
OF THE
WE CAN HAVE UH DIFFERENT UH UH FRONTS OF THE
TELEPHONE
ARE THESE DESIGNS
YES
IT THIS A REAL UH YOUNG YOUNG AND DYNAMIC UH UH STYLES
YES
YES
BUT ALSO W
YES B BU BUT WHEN WE USE S SOFT
MM
MM
BUT IT IT THEN IT UH YOU CAN'T THROW IT IT
IT WILL UH MAKE A HUGE NOISE OR BREAK OTHER STUFF
WHEN YOU THROW WITH UH TITANIUM WITH YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
NO UH
TITANIUM IS A BIT UH IT'S A BIT HARDER
BUT ALSO ON THE COLOURS THE YOUNG
YES BUT A TITANIUM REMOTE CONTROL WHEN YOU'RE UH WATCHING T. V. UH OR YOUR HANDS ARE A LITTLE BIT SWEATY AND THE
YES
SPORTS AND GAMING
DEFINE
YES IT'S W BUT IT IS UH PLASTIC
YES W WE CAN DO THAT ON THE ON THE
WE CAN MAKE THIS AS A STYLE TOO
UH THIS IS UH JUST A
NO WE C WE CAN MAKE IT FROM THE SAME KIND OF PLASTIC
UH
I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION
UH I I DIDN'T GOT IT
YES
LIKE THE M. P. THREE PLAYER
UH IN A LOT OF OTHER UH
IN A LOT OF OTHER PRODUCT UH CATEGORIES LIKE UH EVEN IN B IN BAGS INDUSTRY
UH THEY BEGAN WITH UH T TYPICAL UH LEATHER BAGS BUT THEN THEY BECAME STYLISH
WITH ALL ALL SI ALL SORT OF COLOURS AND W KIND OF FON OF UH OF FRONTS LIKE WE CAN USE ON THE TELEPHONE AND IT
LIKE EASTPACK UH BEGAN A REVOLUTION WITH IT WITH ALL THIS UH KIND OF BAGS AND AND COLOURS AND AND
YES AND AND STYLES
THEY HAVE UH ALSO UH A KIND OF UH UM
UH ROSES ON IT A AND UH
THEN WE CAN ALWAYS UH USE THE SAME DESIGN FOR A GREATER RESEMBLANCE BUT WITH NEW UH WITH NEW COLOURS NEW YES
THERE THERE ARE THREE UH COMPONENTS THREE COMPONENTS TYPE
YOU HAVE THE BUTTONS THE THE CASE UH ITSELF AND THE RUBBER AND TH
YES
YEAH OR OR WHEN YOU USE THE BUTTONS AS BLACK IT YOU CAN USE TWO COLOURS AS WELL UH
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO PUT UH UP AND DOWN AND UH LEFT AND RIGHT
OKAY
UH
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW
I WILL MAKE ONE IN THE NEXT UH TWENTY MINUTES
BACK TO THE PEN
OKAY
KEYBOARD WORK
YEAH
ALRIGHT
THAT'S TRUE I GUESS
YEAH
HUH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH THAT'LL BE FOR THE FUTURE I GUESS
YEAH
YEAH
DEFINITELY
ALRIGHT
YEAH
THAT'S OKAY
MM YEAH
THEN YOU AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A FLAG S VERY BIG R. C.
YEAH
NO
NEXT CHANNEL PREVIOUS CHANNEL
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE FUNCTION
WELL IF YOU SAVE UH PERHAPS UH S TINY BUTTONS AREN'T USER FRIENDLY THEN WE WOULDN'T IM IMPLEMENT THAT OF COURSE
OH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
YEP
THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE THE TH
YES
THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE B FOUR MOST MOST USED BUTTONS ON THE TH IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
SORRY
YEAH SURE
YOU DON'T CARE
NO SORRY
YEAH
OH
GO AWAY
COME ON
OH GREAT
WELL I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH AGAIN ABOUT TRENDS ON THE INTERNET
UM I'VE DONE SOME INVESTIGATION AND UH WELL
I UH GOT SOME INFORMATION FROM FASHION WATCHERS FROM PARIS AND UH MILAN
SOME UH SOME FINDINGS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FANCY LOOK AND FEEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UH WELL WE WERE GOING TO IMPLY THAT SO THAT'S NICE
THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING IS UH INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IN THE R. C.
UH OUR MARKET REALLY LIKES REALLY LIKES THAT
AND UH THE THIRD POINT THERE IN THIS UH ORDER IF OF IMPORTANCE THE THIRD POINT IS A HIGH EASE OF USE
AND UH WELL FOR THE IDEA I'VE PUT SOME TRENDS UH FOR THE MARKET OF ELDERLY PEOPLE
DARK COLOURS SIMPLE RECOGNISABLE SHAPES
SO WE PROBABLY WON'T DO THAT
THE YOUNGER MARKET LIKES UH WELL THE THEMES OF OF THIS YEAR ARE UH SURPRISINGLY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND SPONGY MATERIAL
I FOUND THIS IMAGE WHICH IS UH WELL IT SYMBOLISES THE IDEA OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
I DON'T SEE THE SPONGY PART IN IT
BUT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF FANCY
EXACTLY
I GOT SOME IDEAS UH WELL YEAH PICTURES ISN'T REALLY GOOD WORD BUT UM
SOME SYMBOLS OF FRUITS OR VEGETABLES MAYBE
UH CATCHY COLOURS
FRUIT IS UH YELLOW GREEN RED WHATEVER
SO REMOTE CONTROLS IN IN CATCHY COLOURS
UH NO WE DON'T WANT DARK COLOURS
NO I JUST PUT THEM THERE TO UH YEAH UH FOR GENERAL IDEA
AND UH THE DOCKING ST UH I THINK THE SPONGY MATERIAL IS IS VERY IRRITATING FOR THE UH REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
BUT TO
YEAH THE TO IMPLEMENT SOME SPONGY THING MAYBE WE CAN DO IT IN THE IN THE DOCKING STATION
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOCKING STATION OR WHATEVER
AND UH WE COULD BRING ONE LINE WITH A DARK COLOUR UH TO UM UH P UH YEAH UH UH V HOW DO YOU SAY
YEAH ALSO A BIT FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO ARE A LITTLE BIT CRAZY AND WANT MAYBE WANT A LITTLE YOUNGER DESIGN BUT STILL THE DARK COLOUR
I MEAN IT IT IT REACHES A DIFFERENT MARKET UH
BUT IT IT IT DOESN'T COST REALLY MUCH EFFORT TO B TO UH BRING UH LIKE A BLACK R. C. ON THE MARKET OR WHATEVER
YES
YEAH THERE'S THERE'S ALWAYS A
WELL THERE THERE'S ALWAYS EMPTY SPACE OF COURSE ON A REMOTE CONTROL
I MEAN I THINK THIS PART OF THE R. C. UH WELL THE UPPER THE UPPER PART OR WHATEVER IS UH IS NOT NOT USED WITH BUTTONS I GUESS
SO YOU YOU CAN PUT SOME FRUITY THINGS
NO OF COURSE NOT
ESPECIALLY I
YEAH YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
IF WE MAKE IT LITTLE BIT GREENISH
A AND WE COULD USE ONE OF THESE FOR THE UH W WHAT IS IT
UH
ISN'T
WHA WHATEVER
YEAH SURE
YEAH
WELL W WE CAN UH W WE CAN WE CAN PRODUCE MULTIPLE UH MULTIPLE THINGS
THIS IS THEN THE UH PEAR
I DON'T KNOW THE ENGLISH WORD SO FORGET IT
AND UM MAYBE YEAH A B A BANANA IS UH IS N NOT EASY FOR A REMOTE CONTROL BUT M YEAH
MAYB MAYBE TWO OR THREE
YEAH
NO SURE BUT BUT
B BUT THAT'S GREAT AND AND AND WHAT I WAS WHAT WHAT I WAS SAYING THE CATCHY COLOURS
YEAH
YEAH UH NOT REALLY
PICTURES WAS A WAS A BAD WORD BUT
WELL WE C YEAH
YEAH SURE
MAYBE WE CAN IF IF WE GOT OUR DOCKING STATION OVER HERE
I CAN'T DRAW WITH THIS THING BUT I'LL TRY
IF THIS IS OUR DOCKING STATION WE CAN MAKE OUR LOGO OVER HERE
IT DOESN'T WORK
AND THEN
WELL THE BUTTON BUTTON OVER HERE OR WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW
ON THE FRONT OF COURSE BECAUSE ELSE YOU CAN'T FIND IT
WELL THAT WERE MY IDEAS A LITTLE BIT
I'LL CLOSE 'EM DOWN
UM GO AWAY
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN YES
THE AGENDA
WELL IT'S NICE OF COURSE
BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DISPLAY ON IT
I MEAN
YEAH BUT IT SHOULD BE LI LIKE THIS BIG AND I DON'T THINK
YES SURE
BUT IT IT HAS TO TO SHOW AN ENTIRE TITLE OF A PROGRAMME OR AT LEAST A Q A QUITE QUITE LARGE PART OF IT AND THEN YOU GET A VERY LARGE L. C. D. SCREEN
BECAUSE
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
PROGRAMME INFORMATION
BUT
WELL A LOT A LOT OF T. V. S INDEED SHOW UH WHEN YOU UH ZAP TO A
BUT THEN WE ALSO UH W NEED TO BRING OUT A LINE OF T. V. S WHICH WE WERE PLANNING TO BUT WHATEVER
BECAUSE THE T. V. HAS TO SEND INFORMATION BACK TO THE R. C. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S POSSIBLE
YES YES O OF COURSE IT'S POSSIBLE BUT YOU GOTTA UH IMPLEMENT IT IN THE T. V. S
AND I DON'T THINK EVERYONE'S GONNA BUY A REAL REACTION T. V. WITHIN A MONTH AFTER THE RELEASE OF OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE IT BREAKS F YEAH IT IT IT'S NOT VERY SOLID IT'S UH FRAG FRAGILE
NO
NO
I DON'T THINK SO EI EITHER
AH
BASTARD
YEAH I GUESS
NO
YEAH THAT'S TRUE IF YOU UH YEAH
NO
WELL I THINK IT'S UH I THINK IT'S PRETTY TRENDY TO BE HONEST
UH BUT UM I DON'T KNOW IF IF IF WELL I'M COMING BACK TO THE COSTS AGAIN
BUT I THINK UH WE GOTTA BUILD A B PRETTY CHEAP DESIGN TO TO STAY WITHIN OUR LIMITS
AND I THINK UH ESPECIALLY COLOUR L. C. D. WHICH IS INDEED PRETTY TRENDY
BUT I DON'T THINK UH I THINK IT WILL BE TOO EXPENSIVE
UH DID IT SAY A PRICE ALSO UH FOR FOR UH MONOGRAMME UH L. C. D. OR UH COLOURED L. C. D.
YEAH REALLY IF Y IF YOU C I
I IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR YOU CAN'T UH PUT SOMETHING ON THE MARKET WHICH IS A MONOGRAMME
REALLY
YEAH
W WE'VE WE'VE GOTTA FIND A BALANCE OF COURSE
AND I THINK
WE HAVE A PEAR
IS THAT SO
WAS IT IT WASN'T JUST A PROTOTYPE
EXACTLY I'VE NEVER SEEN IT IN A STORE
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE TOO MUCH YEAH
OKAY
NO
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH FOR THE SPONGY UH FEEL
YEAH
YEAH AIRBAG
IF YOU DROP IT IF YOU DROP IT THE AIRBAG COMES OUT YEAH
YEAH
NO
YEAH B YEAH THAT'S WHAT W I I WAS POINTING AT
WHAT
OH A BEE
OH
YEAH
HMM
WELL WE CAN AS AS I
DRAW REALLY NICELY OVER THERE
WE CAN PUT THE LOGO ON OUR UH ON OUR BASE STATION
UH YEAH
AND MAYBE VERY VERY TINY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
BUT I
YEAH
I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S ENOUGH
THAT'S WAY TOO NOKIA
YEAH DEFINITELY
JUST BRING MORE DESIGNS ON THE MARKET
WHY NOT YEAH
SURE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH I THINK IT I THINK IT DOES
YEAH O
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE FRUIT FRUITY STUFF WITH UH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
YES
YEAH
WHAT
OH YEAH
OKAY YEAH
YEAH I SEE
YEAH BUT BUT BUT
YEAH I TH I THINK THAT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE UH THAT'S DIFFERENT MATERIAL AND THEN YOU GOTTA HAVE LIKE UH UH UH TWO MATERIAL LINES OF OF OF
YEAH IF IT'S JUST A COLOUR UH WHICH YOU UH WHICH YOU CHANGE THEN I GUESS IT'S IT'S NICE TO HAVE ONE OF THESE
UH
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
UH YEAH YEAH
YES
NEW PRINTS ON IT
YEP
HOW DO YOU MEAN
TH TH THE UH BASE IN A IN ANOTHER
YES
HOW THE BUTTONS YEAH
YEAH
NO DEFINITELY NOT
YES DEFINITELY
NO I THINK THAT'S TOO VULNERABLE
YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S I WAS THINKING THAT'S GOTTA BE ON THE TELEVISION
MM
YEAH IF IT'S C IF
YEAH I THINK IT'S OKAY TO TO ADD A MENU BUTTON FOR UH AND IF THE T. V. DOESN'T HAVE A MENU THEN
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN PUT THAT ON THE TWO EIGHT FOUR AND SIX OR WHATEVER
MM YEAH
A MUTE AND A TELETEXT AND A MENU
THAT'S ALL
HMM
GREAT
YEAH
YEAH DEFINITELY
ARE WE GONNA DO SOMETHING WITH THE UH SPONGY THING THERE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
YEAH IT'S KINDA FRUITY AND WITH TH WITH CATCHY COLOURS UH UH W
YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH
OKAY
I GUESS SO
YES
YEA YEAH
YEP
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I GUESS NOT
DO YOU GUYS
NO
IN THE SHARED FOLDER
YOU'LL SEE IN YOU EMAIL I GUESS
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW
CONSTRUCT ONE YEAH
ALRIGHT SHALL WE GET BACK TO WORK
GREAT
YEAH
BASTARD
YOU LAZY
OKAY WELCOME TO THE DETAILED DESIGN MEETING
AGAIN I'M GONNA TAKE MINUTES
OH WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION FIRST
UH WHO'S GONNA GIVE THE PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION
YOU TWO GUYS
OKAY
GO AHEAD
OH NO THE THE THE MUTE BUTTON MISSES NOW
DO Y DO YOU DID WE WANT TO HAVE A M MUTE BUTTON
HUH
WAIT THERE'S WAS ONE THING I WANTED TO ASK
UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS FOR REMOTE CONTROLS TO UH DO UH LIKE
UH D I CALL IT TEENS AND TWENTIES
UH Y TH TH TH THE TWO NUMBERS
YEAH BUT DO WE HAVE DO WE NEED EXTRA BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE SOME UH SOME HAVE TO
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED THEM
BECAU B L A LOT OF REMOTE CONTROLS WORK THAT Y WHEN Y THAT YOU WHEN YOU FIR YOU PUSH THE ONE FIRST
THEN YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF SECONDS NO I DON'T THINK SO
NAH I DON'T THINK SO REALLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A I KNOW SOME REMOTE CONTROLS THAT DON'T HAVE THESE BUTTONS
BUT YOU STILL CAN KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN STILL SELECT THE TWENTY UH A NUMBER IN THE TWENTY OR IN THE TEN
NO I THINK UH I REALLY THINK IT'S N BECAUSE YOU CAN WHEN WHEN YOU PUT A BUTTON ON IT WITH LIKE ONE AND UH THEN A DASH
IT'S THE SAME THING AS WHEN YOU JUST PUSH THE ONE
BECAUSE IT I IT FIRST GIVES YOU THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THAT THAT UH SEPARATE BUTTON YOU ALSO HAD TO UH APPLY
YEAH BECAUSE THAT'S I IT'S FOR TELEVISION
IT'S EXACT THE SAME THING
NO LISTEN LISTEN
WHEN YOU PUSH THE BUTTON THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES A SIGNAL
I IN TH IN THE FIRST PLACE IT GIVES A SIGNAL WHICH IT WOULD ALSO SEND WHEN YOU PUT A SEPARATE BUTTON ON IT
THE ONE WITH DASH THAT SIGNAL GI AND WHEN Y WHE WHEN YOU DON'T PUSH ANOTHER BUTTON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL WITHIN FIVE SECONDS
THEN THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES A SIGNAL FOR CHANNEL ONE
I THINK IT WORKS THAT WAY REALLY
YEAH BUT IT'S EXACT THE SAME THAT W WOULD APPEAR WHEN YOU PUT A SEPARATE BUTTON PUSH A SEPARATE BUTTON
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T UNDERST UH YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MY POINT
I THINK IT'S EXACT THE SAME THING WHEN Y
NO BUT THEN THEY WOULD A WOULD ALSO SUPPORT THAT BUTTON BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME THING
LISTEN WITH THAT THAT'S THAT SPECIAL BUT BUTTON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EH
THAT'S JUST A SIGNAL TO RECEI JU THEY SEND A T SIGNAL TO THE V TV T. V. THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT A ONE IN ON YOUR SCREEN AND A DASH
WHICH YOU CAN PU SO YOU CAN UH STILL PUT ANOTHER NUMBER ON IT
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SEPARATE BUTTON AND YOU PUSH Y ONE IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING
DO Y YOU THE REMOTE CONTROL GIVES THAT SAME SIGNAL AS IT WOULD GIVE WHEN YOU ONLY HAD
YEAH
BUT YOU GIVE THE INPUT
YOU PUSH THE ONE
THAT'S THE SAME THING AS THE BUTTON WITH THE ONE AND IT YES IT IT IS
THINK ABOUT IT
AND IT'S THE SAME THING WHAT HAPPENS AND A G REMOTE CONTROL GIVES ANOTHER SIGNAL AFTER FIVE SECONDS THAT IS JUST ONE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH BUT I M UH BUT IT'S I I KNOW FOR SURE THAT SOME TELEVISIONS THAT W TH TH THE REMOTE CONTROL SUPPLIED
ONLY HA HAS THE C THESE BUTTONS WITH A ONE AND A DASH AND A TWO AND A DASH
BUT WHEN YOU USE A BU A N REMOTE CONTROL THAT DOESN'T SPORT THESE BUTTONS IT STILL WORKS
BUT OKAY WE WE'LL IMPL
NO WE'LL APPLY THEM THEN FOR NOW
YEAH APP JUST APPLY THEM NEXT TO THE ZERO THE ONE AND THE TWO
YEAH I THINK SO
YEAH FOR NOW IF WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER
YEAH BUT OKAY
WHAT I SAID ABOUT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL SENDING ANOTHER SIGNAL THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE
BUT I STILL THINK I IT IT ALL T. V. S IN SOME WAYS SUPPORT IT I DON'T KNOW
I THINK IT'S MORE C IS M MAYBE WE DON'T UH WE BOTH DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT I HOW IT REALLY WORKS
BUT I THINK THERE'S MORE TO IN THAN WHA THAN WHAT YOU JUST SAID
I DO THINK THAT UH M T. V. S SUPPORT MUR MULTIPLE KIND OF REMOTE CONTROLS
M
TH WON'T WORK WI WITH UH TO HAVE THAT SPECIAL BUTTON
OKAY WELL WE'LL SEE
BUT
WELL LET'S HA LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DOCKING STATION LATER BECAUSE UH MAYBE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO UH CONSIDER THE DOCKING STATION ANYWAY
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME UH COST ISSUES STILL TO COME
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK N I DON'T KNOW
YEAH
OKAY
YES
THAT'S IT
I THINK ADDED LIGHTS ARE GONNA BE A PROBLEM TOO
OKAY
FOR NOW UH THIS IS UH IS GOOD ENOUGH
YEAH WHAT WAS UH ON THE
OKAY BUT IN THE OH YEAH THE COLOUR
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA USE UH ONE COLOUR FOR THE THE PLASTIC ENCLOSURE AND ONE COLOUR FOR THE RUBBER ISN'T IT
THEN WE'RE GONNA DO THE BUTTONS IN THE I ARE WE'RE GONNA HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS
AND THEY'RE BE A THEY'LL BE IN THE SAME COLOUR AS THE RUBBER ON THE SIDE
OKAY
AND I THINK WE SHOULD USE A A DARKER COLOUR FOR THE UM PLASTIC AND MAYBE SOME MORE M BRIGHTER AND FLASHY STUFF
YEAH WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE LIGHTS LATER
'CAUSE I ALSO DON YEAH IT'S DEPENDS ON THE COSTS AND SUCH
BUT UH AND WE HAVE TO AGREE UH UPON THE EXACT COLOURS BUT MAY I DUNNO IF THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER
OKAY FOR NOW THIS IS THIS IS OKAY
UM THE NEXT P Y YOU GONNA GIVE A PRESENTATION TOO
UH I HAVE TO SEE THE AGENDA
DETAIL DESIGN
EVALUATION CRITERIA
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH I THINK FOUR MAYBE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT'S
YEAH MAYBE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON TASTE
UH I MEAN IT'S KIND OF OUR DESIGN
IT'S SO IF MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND IT REALLY UGLY YOU KNOW O OTHER PEOPLE FIND IT REALLY COOL
I DON'T KNOW OR UH I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
CASTING
YEAH
YEAH BUT WE D WE DIDN'T WE'RE WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO USE FRONTS I BELIEVE
WITH A COLOUR A CO A COLOURS
OH OKAY
OKAY BUT
OH MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THREE OR SOMETHING THAT W YOU KNOW OUR
YEAH
UH I WAS THINKING ABOUT FOUR SO I THINK THREE IS UH
YEAH WELL LET THAT LET'S MAKE THAT A ONE
THAT'S ONE THING FOR SURE
YEAH TWO OR A ONE I GUESS
IT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY PUT WORK INTO
YEAH
BUT
WELL MAYBE A TWO BECAUSE OF THE MENU BUTTON OR SOMETHING
AND TELETE
YEAH WE DON'T KNOW IF THE UH THEY'RE NECESSARY
I THINK A TWO
CAME A LONG WAY BUT NOT WE DIDN'T NOT UH
NO W W IT CAN ALSO ALWAYS BE MORE SIMPLISTIC BUT TWO IS YEAH
YEAH UH A T I THINK A TWO
YEAH YEAH Y I IT'S HARD TO SAY FROM THIS PICTURE
BUT I DO THINK IT'S MORE
BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S MORE TRENDY THAN BEAUTIFUL
SO SO I THINK MAYBE IT HAS TO SCORE HIGHER UH ON THIS THAN ON THE
A TH A THREE
I I UH WHEN YOU COMPARE TO THE
UH UH WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH
OKAY
NO
YEAH BUT WE UH YOU MEAN THE RUBBER STUFF
YEAH BUT WE HAVE T WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE LIGHTS UH
AND I DON'T U ALSO IT'S ALSO REALLY NOT INNOVATIVE IT'S MORE
NO SIX
OR SEVEN MAYBE YEAH
OR SIX
YEAH MINE IS SEVEN
UH IT'S UH DEPENDS ON THE ON THE MAYBE
NO I THINK I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S A SEVEN MAYBE BUT THERE'S NOTHING INNOVATIVE ABOUT IT
N NO NO T
YEAH I MEAN THE DOCK STATION BUT BUT UH I THINK THE THE DOCKING STATION IT'S GONNA BE A KIND OF A PROBLEM
BUT
WELL LET'S LEAVE IT OPEN FOR UH FOR US LATER TO SEE WHAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REEVALUATE ANYWAY
WELL I I YEAH
NO
OKAY FOR NOW IT'S A SIX OR A SEVEN UH SEV SIX MAYBE BECAUSE
YEAH BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S VERY INNO YEAH
YEAH V
YEAH MORE THROUGH UH LIKE FUNCTION T. V. FUNCTIONALITIES AND NO NO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YOU HAVE MUST BE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR REMOTE CONTROLS BUT MORE IN HOW YOU CONTROL STUFF NOT IN HOW YOU FIND YOUR YEAH
YEAH IT'S THAT'S THAT'S THINK ABOUT IT LA LATER ON AND UH
YEAH AS A A ONE OR A TWO MA UH AT LEAST
YEAH IT'S GOOD
NO I WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ONE BEFORE
OH YOU SKIPPED ONE UH
UH HERE
REMOTE CONTROL WILL BE BOUGHT BY
YEAH
DEFINITELY
WELL
UH JUST IN GENERAL
YEAH A TWO
YEAH BUT I THINK I THINK TWO
UH THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION
IT'S JUST W IT WILL BE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE UNDER FORTY
YEAH YOU CAN YEAH YOU CAN BE VERY PICKY ABOUT IT
AH YEAH JUST MAKE IT WE'LL MAKE IT A TWO
OH NO
YEAH
YEAH YOU HAVE MAKE AN SLOGAN IS QUITE OBVIOUS
OH THE OH SORRY NO NOT NOT THE SLOGAN
YEAH YOU CAN PUT THAT ON THE SIDE IF IF WE WOULD LIKE TO
YEAH AND I WILL I TH STILL THINK IT'S GONNA BE A TWO OR A THREE
MAYBE A THREE THIS TIME
AND UH
UH IT'S A ONE OR A TWO
YEAH MAKE IT A TWO
IT'S NOT THAT BAD
YEAH AND THAT'S MOSTLY THE INNO WHEN WE UH SCORE HIGHER ON INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY WE WOULD SCORE TWO
WHICH IS UH QUITE A GREAT SCORE
OKAY
UH THIS IS WAS UH THE EVALUATION
BECAUSE I I STILL THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS MEETING STILL HAS
YEAH
STILL OPENED OR UH
YEAH
OKAY FINANCE
BECAUSE UM
I RECEIVED UH A SPREADSHEET
YEAH BUT I UH ACTUALLY DON'T NEED THIS PRESENTATION I GUESS
OH
I'M GONNA OPEN THE SPREADSHEET AND WE'RE GONNA WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALLY FIN UH I HAVE A
DIDN'T REALLY FINISH IT
WELL WE UH WE'LL SEE
WE'LL STUMBLE UPON SOME PROBLEMS
I PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY OPENED IT HERE
TRY IT AGAIN
FIRST OF ALL THE MM ALL THE DOCKING STATION AND COSTS AND SUCH ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS LIST
BUT LET'S LET'S ST START WITH BEGINNING
WE INCLUDE ONE BATTERY
I I UH I'LL EXPLAIN ITS UH THE THE COMPONENTS ARE LISTED OVER HERE
UH PRICE IS GIVEN
WE UM YEAH WE WE UH INDICATE THE AMOUNT OF COMPONENTS OF THE SPECIF SPECIFIC COMPONENT HOW MUCH WE NEED OF THEM
AND THEN UH WE'LL UH CALCULA DON'T WATCH THE NUMBER YET
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FILLED IN PROPERLY
OKAY WE NEED ONE BATTERY
ONE BATTERY
I THINK ONE BATTERY IS ENOUGH
WE DON'T NEED KINETIC SOLAR CELLS HAND DYNAMO
A S OKAY THIS THIS IS A P FIRST PROBLEM
UH I THINK
WE SHOULD KNOW HOW MANY
SIMPLE CHIPS REGULAR CHIPS
OKAY
BUT
WHERE DID WE FIND THIS INFORMATION
WAS IT
I THINK IT WAS UH YOUR JOB IN THE FIRST UH MEET UH
F YOUR FIRST PRESENTATION TO MAKE THIS CLEAR BUT THEN YOU HAD SOME T TIME PROBLEMS
BUT DO YOU TH YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT CHIP WE NEED
MAYBE YOU CAN UH LOOK IT UP RIGHT NOW
OKAY BUT OKAY
WHEN WE DON'T WHEN WE LEAVE THE UH RETRIEVER AND SUCH ASIDE WHAT THEN IT WOULD BE A SIMPLE CHIP
AND WITH THE RETRIEVER IT WOULD BE AN ADVANCED CHIP
OKAY
YEAH BUT IT WILL IT WILL IT WILL BE CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS
THE SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER
WHAT IS IT M IS THAT THE SPEAKER WE WERE T I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
OKAY WE WENT FOR THE DOUBLE CURVED CASE
MADE OUT OF PLASTIC
AND RUBBER
AND WITH A SPECIAL COLOUR
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT WE WERE
YEAH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SPECIAL COLOUR BUT I THINK W UH
YEAH I THINK WE UH WE HAVE SPECIAL COLOURS
OKAY THEN THE PUSH BUTTON I WAS JUST COUNTING THEM
UH I THINK YOU HAVE TO INDICATE THE AMOUNT OF PUSH BUTTONS WE WANT TO USE ISN'T IT
WELL THAT'S BIT OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE I RE BUT I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I CAN IMAGINE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH FAR MORE PUSH BUTTONS
AND IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO THIS UH SHEET
YEAH
AH
YEAH IT WOULDN'T
FILL IN THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS YOU PLAN TO USE IN THE AND THE TOTAL COST I DON'T KNOW
I
AND I COUNT THEM LIKE THIS
ONE TWO THREE UH FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE AND THIRTEEN
BECAUSE OH THIS IS OH THIS IS ONE OKAY
TWELVE OKAY THEN IT WOULD BE EIGHTEEN BECAUSE UH I UH RATED THEM AS UH UM
AS UH UH UH SEPARATE BUTTONS
YES
AND PLUS THESE TWO F UH PLUS THE MUTE BUTTON AND IT'S WILL BE UH EIGHTEEN
YEAH I DON'T UNDERSTAND
Y I DO I DON'T GET THE POINT BECAUSE IT'S WOULD BE
S RELATIVELY SO EXPENSIVE JUST THESE M SMALL BUTTONS
WELL OKAY WELL WELL LET'S MAKE IT JUST ONE
HERE NOW IT'S NOW IT'S ALREADY S SHALL WE JUST
GIVE OUR OWN INTERPRETATION TO BECAUSE ELSE WE WOULD REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT
AND AND LESS BUTTONS THAN THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE
THIS IS THE MOST SIMPLE YEAH IT IS POSSIBLE BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE
YEAH WITHOUT THE NUMBERS
THAT'S POSSIBLE
YEAH WE COULD SKIP THE NUMBERS
THEN UH TELETEXT WOULD ALSO BE IM IMPOSSIBLE
OKAY WE'LL WE'LL JUST OKAY
BUT THEN STILL WHEN WE THERE'S NO ROOM FOR A DOCKING STATION OR SOMETHING
THA W LE LET'S SEE TH WE HAVE UH OH YEAH BUTTON SUPPLEMENTS
WE'LL GIVE THE BUTTONS SPECIAL COLOUR
WE'LL GIVE THEM A SPECIAL FORM
UH I THINK WE SHOULD MARK THE SPECIAL FORM THING BECAUSE IT THIS WILL BE SOME SPECIAL FORMS INCORPORATED IN THESE BIG BUTTONS I GUESS
BECAUSE THE BUTTONS WILL BE UH D WILL BE MATCHING COLOUR BETWEEN THE BUTTONS AND THE RUBBER SURROUNDINGS
I THINK THAT'S THE WHAT THEY MEAN BY A SPECIAL COLOUR
I THINK ALL THE SPECIAL COLOUR THINGS HAVE TO BE MARKED OVER HERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WERE PLANNING TO DO MAKING IT
YEAH SPECIAL MATERIAL R ALSO BECAUSE I HAS RUBBER
AND THE BUTTONS HAVE TO BE RUBBER
'KAY BUT THE PROBLEM NOW IS THAT THE
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A DOCKING STATION IN THIS LIST BUT WE CAN ALL IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A DOCKING STATION FOR THIRTY CENTS
SEPARATELY
YEAH YEAH
YEAH BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA BUT WE YEAH
IT UH BUT IT THEN THE DOCKING STATION ISN'T RELEVANT FOR THIS PROJECT ANYMORE
BUT WE CAN BUT THEN YOU STILL HAVE TO USE WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT CHIP WE U NEED
I THINK WE CAN AGREE ON THIS
I I THINK THE SPECIAL COLOUR THING HAS TO BE UH MARKED
'CAUSE I THINK WE UH YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT WHAT WHAT THEY UH MEAN
BUT CAN WE FIND OUT UH ABOUT UH THIS CHIPS
BECAUSE WHEN WE DON'T NEED A D A DOCKING STATION THEN PROBABLY WE ALSO HAVE ONLY WE ALSO NEED A SIMPLE CHIP
AND MAYBE THEN WE CAN DO SOMETHING EXTRA
OH N UH OH STILL OH IT'S GONNA GET MORE EXPENSIVE WITH
TWO
THEN WE HAVE SOME MONEY LEFT
WE CAN PUT THEN
WE CAN PUT A SCROLL WHEEL ON IT OR SOMETHING
YEAH WELL WHO KNOWS
OR A LITTLE BIT OF TIN TITANIUM
YEAH OR WE CAN KI DO THE KINETIC CELLS
THAT'S ALSO MAYBE AN IDEA
YEAH THAT'S WHAT THEN WHAT HE HAS TO FIND OUT
MAYBE YOU CAN UH FIND IT IN YOUR EMAIL RIGHT NOW THEN WE KNOW THEN WE EXACTLY KNOW WHAT IT WILL COST US
MAYBE IS THAT THAT'S NICE TO KNOW
YEAH BU BU BUT WHEN WE YEAH BUT WHEN WE SKIP WHEN WE UM WHEN WE DON'T USE THE DO WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THE DOCKING STATION
THEN WE STILL YEAH WE NEED SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE TO MAKE IT KIND OF SPECIAL BECAUSE THAT WAS OUR OUR SPECIAL FEATURE
YEAH OKAY YOU CAN ALSO DO THAT BUT MAYBE
IT STILL IS A SPECIAL REMOTE CONTROL CONS UH YOU KNOW WI ITS FORM IS SPECIAL AND MATERIAL
YEAH BUT FOR TWO EUROS THEN WE HAVE STILL MAYBE WE HAVE TO USE THE ADVANCED CHIP THEN TWO EUROS ISN'T EVEN POSSIBLE
YEAH THEN BECAUSE THEN WE'D THIRTY CENTS LEFT
YEAH BUT YEAH I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE MAYBE D UH YEAH WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WITH THE SIMPLE CHIP
YEAH AND W AND AND WE UH NEED F AND WHAT IS THIS
SAMPLE SENSOR SAMPLE SPEAKER
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FOR S PRESENTATION
S TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
OH
OH OH OH
HEY
OH
MM
I DON'T THINK HERE IT'S IN HERE ALREADY
IT'S NOTHING ABOUT S YEAH
NO
BUT I IN THE PRESENTATION OF YOURS THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING ABOUT DIFFERENT COMPONENTS
WHICH ONE WAS IT
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
AH
AH YES IT WAS THE SECOND ONE
YEAH IT WAS YOUR SECOND YOUR FIRST PRESENTATION
SORRY
UH THIS IS N THIS IS NOT THIS N THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE
I DON'T OH
NO THIS IS THE OTHER ONE
OR MAYBE SOMETHING IS UH MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING ABO IN IN THESE
HERE
YOU KNOW THAT A PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP BUT A SCROLL WHEEL IT IT ME REQUIRES OKAY SO WE ONLY NEED A SIMPLE CHIP
NO NO THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE CHIP
A SCROLL WHEEL IT S UH ONLY STATES THAT A SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES A REGULAR CHIP AND THAT A DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP
SO WE DON'T NEED ANY OF THEM
AND WHAT'S THE SAMPLE SENSOR SLASH SAMPLE SPEAKER
OKAY
BACK TO THE COSTS
SO WE'RE GONNA USE THE SIMPLE CHIP
NAH THERE IS SOME MONEY LEFT TO BE SPENT
OKAY BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT NOW IS THAT IS IS IT STILL A SPECIAL REMOTE CONTROL
BUT I MEAN IT ISN'T IT HASN'T GOT ANY INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY WE AREN'T GONNA APPLY ANY UH INNOVATED INNOVATIVE TE TECHNOLOGY ANYWAY I THINK
I DON'T I DON'T SEE ANY POSSIBILITY TO DO SO BECAUSE IT WOULD WOULDN'T FIT OUR DEFI DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
BUT WHAT W IS THERE SOME EXTRA MAYBE I THINK MAYBE THE KINETIC THING IS SOMETHING
INSTEAD OF THE RECHARGEABLE THE RECHARGEABLE THING WAS SOMETHING TO UM KNOW SO Y SO PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR BATTERIES ANYMORE
MAYBE WE IF WE PUT THE KINETIC THING IN IT
YEAH YOU LEAVE THE P YEAH I KNOW BUT STILL I THEY WILL THINK ABOUT THAT
I MEAN IF YOU U
THE UH IT'S MADE FOR S PEOPLE WELL THE THEY DON'T IF IT WAS UH UH R USELESS TECHNOLOGY THEY WOULDN'T PUT IT UH AS A POSSIBILITY
AND I IT IT TH TH THE THE TARGET THE TARGET UH GROUP ARE PEOPLE WHO ZAP REGULARLY AND THROW WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROL AS A MATTER OF SPEAKING
BECAUSE I THINK IT WHEN WHEN THERE W WAS A REMOTE CONTROL WHERE IT WAS USEFUL TO HAVE A KINETIC UH UH POWER SOURCE
THEN IT WOULD BE THIS ONE
BECAUSE IT'S ONE IT GETS THROWN AROUND THROWN AROUND A LOT AND IT GETS USED A LOT
HEY THAT MAYBE THAT'S COOL THAT'S A COOL THING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW
YOU DON'T USE BATTERIES
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE IN A REMOTE CONTROL
NO WE WE WE CAN'T MAKE A DOCKING STATION ANYWAY
YEAH WE CAN ALS OR UH ALSO M WE WE CAN MAKE ONE WE CAN STILL MAKE
YEAH BUT BE SERIOUS THEN UH THE DOCKING STATION WILL BE A FIFTH OF THE PRICE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH BUT WE UH WE DON'T INC WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE THESE COSTS OF THE SPEAKER AND OTHER STUFF
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC FOR YOU TO DO SO
OH BECAUSE WE
WE WELL LOOK AT ALL THE SPECIAL STUFF WE HAVE
COLOUR A THE COLOURS ARE SPECIAL THE FORM IS SPECIAL
IT TH THIS IS WHOLE CONCEPT
UH MAYBE IT WITH THE KINETIC THING I THINK WE COULD DO UH DO A COMPROMISE UH WITH THE KIM KINETIC THING
UH NO
YEAH I DON MY SUGGESTION IS TO JUST FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE DOCKING STATION THING AND MAKE IT UH LIKE A
UH UH I I I I STILL FEE I ALSO FEEL THIS CONCEPT OF MAKING IT KINETIC
BECAUSE OF THE YOU KNOW IT G IT GIVES SOMETHING DYNAMIC TO THE REMOTE CONTROL
NO THAT WOULDN'T N NO
YEAH AND IT IS ALSO NOT A GOOD IT'S NOT YOU HAVE TO REALLY DO IT ONLY KINETIC YOU DON'T WANT IT TO THINK ABOUT BATTERIES ANYMORE
NO NO
YEAH IT'S GREAT
NO NO NO
NO NO THIS IS VERY SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY
WHEN YOU USE IT YOUR REMOTE LIKE ONCE A DAY OR MAYBE EVEN LESS I I IT
IT WE CAN MAKE IT YEAH NO
BECAU BE BUT A REMOTE CONTROL GETS WHY DO THEY STATE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED IF IT
YEAH M BUT A W UH UH N UH A CALCULATOR ALSO WORKS ON R ON SOLAR CELLS
BECAUSE I THINK THE D WHOLE DYNAMIC PART DO YOU KNOW APPEALS TO ME QUI UH THINKING OF OUR DESIGN PHILOSOPHY YOU KNOW
WITH THE RUBBER PARTS AND UH STURDINESS OF THE THING AND Y WHEN YOU MOVE IT AROUND A LOT
THEN PEOPLE FIND THE IDEA FUNNY THAT WHEN I MOVE MY REMOTE CONTROL AROUND AND
YEAH BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TRUST ME
THE IDEA OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS THAT YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT IT JUST HAPPENS
OKAY THEN WE D OKAY WELL Y WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT BUT WHAT THAT WOULD JUST HAVE A LACK OF KEY FEATURES YOU KNOW
YOU M HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING ON YOUR BOX
YOU HAVE TO MAKE PEOPLE BUY IT AND UH
WE CAN REALLY CAN DO THE DOCKING THING UH IT'S NOT YEAH UH WE CAN DO IT BUT IT'S WOULD BE A EASY WAY OUT
OKAY BUT WE HAVE TO GROU TO AGREE UPON SOMETHING BECAUSE UH WE ONLY HAVE A MINUTE LEFT OR SO
NO NO IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
OKAY W B WE CAN S WE CAN LEAVE IT ON BE WELL THEN THEN TH IT'S THIS IS THEN THEN OUR CONCEPT IS READY
YEAH WE MAKE SOME EXTRA PROFIT OF IT
HUH ANY IDEAS
NO NO UH THERE'S STILL THERE'S STILL SOMETH CONCEPT AND SOMETHING SPECIAL LEFT
I MEAN WE'RE GONNA IT'S GONNA EXCEL IN IN ON IN THE THE RANGE IN THE FIELD OF DESIGN AND AND UH LOOKS AND FEEL
THAT'S WHAT IT'S MAKES IT SPECIAL
YEAH AND I WOULD LI I WOULD HAVE LIKED A KINETIC PART AS WELL TO GIVE IT SOME
JUST TO GIVE IT SOME EXTRA SPECIAL FEATURE AND UH I KNOW IT WILL WORK
BUT UH IT'S IT'S AN THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT PUTTING TECHNOLOGIES ON THIS BUT IF IT IF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
OKAY WELL WE LEAVE IT LIKE THIS
THEN IT'S C THEN WE'RE YEAH
OKAY PROJECT E UH WELL WE WERE GONNA WHAT LOOK TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAST SHEET
YEAH WE HAVE TO YEAH IT'S
UH I DON'T KNOW
COFFEE
UH WELL THE UH ALL THE FUNCTIONS ARE DISCUSSED UH I THINK THE MOST OF THE FUNCTIONS ARE UH UH OBVIOUS
UH IT'S A LITTLE BIT
UH POWER BUTTON
UH THEN THE THE THE NINE UH CHANNELS
UH THE VOLUME UH
UH AT THE SIDE AND THE OTHER SIDE IS THE PROGRAMMES
AND THEN WE HAD UH JUST UH TWO BUTTONS WE PLACE THEM IN THE MIDDLE UH THE MENU AND FOR THE TELETEXT I THOUGHT THAT WAS TH
OH THE MUTE BUTTON
YEAH
WELL YEAH MO UH MO YEAH WELL MOST OF THEM ARE RIGHT HANDED
YEAH WELL I DON'T HAVE TIME IN UH ANYMORE ON THE
OH YEAH JUST PROGR PROGRAMME ABOVE I THINK
YEAH TRUE YEAH
UH
UH I THINK SO
ZERO
MAY MAYBE HERE
YEAH
AND THEN A SECOND
IS IT DEPENDING ON TELEVISION
YEAH
TRUE
BUT THE EX
YEAH
YOU UH YOU CAN WAI WHEN YOU PUSH THE ONE YOU CAN SHOW ON THE TELLY A ONE AND JUST A DASH
AND THEN WAIT UH TWO UH SECONDS OR SOMETHING
WE'LL DISCUSS THEM IN THE USABILITY LAB
UH EVA EVALUATION
I DON'T KNOW UH I DON'T KNOW IF IF IT'S IT'S NECESSARY
YEAH
OKAY
ACH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL IT YEAH UH THERE'S NOTHING I THINK IT'S PRETTY BASIC
THE THE THERE'S NO FU THERE'S ONE THERE'S ONE BUTTON THAT'S WHA THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S ONE FUNCTION AND THAT'S N THE ONE BUTTON WHEN YOU WANT TO FIND IT
YOU CAN
BUT I I I IT'S BACKWARDS
BUT IT'S IT'S BACKWARDS
IT'S LEANING
IT'S LEANING BACKWARDS I THINK IN THE IN THE DOCKING STATION
THAT'S TEXT
LIGHTS
MM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
NO NOT FRONTS
DIFFERENT DESIGNS
DIFFERENT COLOURS MAYBE YEAH
WE CAN MAKE IT A ONE
MM YEAH
I AGREE
UM I UH I GO FOR THE POSITIVE
SO I GO FOR TWO
OKAY THREE
YEAH
TWO
ONE
ONE
OKAY YEAH I'LL I'LL AGREE
I'M THE I'M THE USABILITY SO
YEAH
THE
WELL
YEAH WELL MENU YEAH MAYBE
YEAH TRUE
YEAH I AGREE
MM TWO
BECAUSE WE GOT
WELL
YEAH
UH I WILL I WILL MAKE IT A THREE BECAUSE UH YEAH
I I TH
YEAH
TRUE YEAH
YEAH
NO
WE'RE NOT WELL MAYBE THE THE THE ON THE SIDE
AND THE LIGHT MAYBE
BUT
WELL SIX
NO SIX
SIX
YEAH
INNOVATIVE IN GENERALLY OR JUST F ORIGINAL FOR
A DOCKING STATION IS INNOVA
OKAY
SIX
YEAH A TWO
MORE TWO
YES
YEAH I THINK TWO YEAH
I AGREE
TWO
WE DON'T HAVE THE SLOGAN THOUGH
THE LOGO
UNDERNEATH IT OR SOMETHING
A THREE
THREE
YEAH A THREE
YEAH TWO
TWO
NO
OKAY YEAH
SHOOT
NO
WELL SPECIAL COLOUR
I DON'T
MM OKAY
WHOA IT'S A LITTLE
THAT'S HUGE
NO
WE HAVE THE SIMPLEST BUTTONS
UH ONE TIL NINE
IS THAT ONE OR IS THAT NINE BUTTONS
YEAH
IS IT CENTS THE THE THE FIFTY CENTS A BUTTON
NO WAY
IT'S WAY
NO NO NO
YEAH UH
THAT'S STILL FOUR
YEAH THAT'S NO OPTION THAT'S NO OPTION
A SPECIAL COLOUR WHY A SPECIAL COLOUR
BUT WHA WHAT S WHAT SPECIAL
OKAY YEAH
UH YEAH
PLASTIC
PLASTIC I THINK
PLASTIC
YEAH
SE NO NO NO
AND THEN WE CAN GET A DOCKING STATION
BUT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO
BUT UH WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE SIMPLE CHIP AND WHAT'S DIFFERENCE WITH A REGULAR CHIP AND A ADVANCED CHIP
IF IF I
REGULAR CHIP AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE UH SPECIAL FUNCTIONS TO USE UH IN ADVANCED CHIP FOR EXAMPLE
YEAH
WE'LL GO BACK UH TOMORROW
THAT'S THE QUESTION
IF WE DO I DO WE NEED AN ADVANCED CHIP OR IS IT OKAY F
NO
NO NO THEY WERE UH MINE YEAH
DIED
YEAH IT'S OPEN
IT'S CIRCUIT BOARD
IT'S ONLY JUST BASICS FOR FOR
AT THE END CIRCUIT THERE IS AN INFRARED LED
COMPONENTS DESIGN
COMPONENTS DESIGN MAYBE
N ON TOP
WORKING DESIGN
YEAH BUT IT'S THE THE OTHER ONE
WAS IT WORKING DESIGN OR COMPONENTS DESIGN
CHIP SET
THE DISPLAY REQUIRES AN ADVANCED CHIP
REQUIRES
LITTLE LIGHTS
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S JUST THE SAME AS THE THE LED
YEAH
NO
I THINK UH THE UH NORMAL UH SIMPLE CHIP WILL BE OKAY
YEAH
YEAH TRUE
WELL THAT'S NOT TOO WHAT WE WANT
SO SIMPLE CHIP IS OKAY
YEAH LIGHTS YEAH THERE'S NO
CATEGORY
CAN WE DO IT WI WITHIN TWO TWO EURO
MM-HMM
BUT IT'S ORIGINAL
BUT THEN WE COULD MAKE A DOCKING STATION
WOW W WHY NO LI LOOK AT NOW WE GOT TWO
TWO THIRTY LEFT
CA CAN'T WE MAKE A DOCKING STATION OF THAT
I DON'T KNOW
WELL WE WE UH
YEAH THEN WE DON'T HAVE ANY INNOVATION THINGS
NO WE ONLY MAKE LESS PROFIT OF IT
NO
CHEAP REMOTE CONTROL
IT W IT WON'T TELL BUT
NO UH N NO
YEAH WE JUST HAVE TO GO ALL WHAT WE DID TODAY AGAIN
YOU HAVE TO DO IT OVER
YEAH
THE
NO BUT NO
YEAH YEAH
NO
YEAH
WE CAN DO IT HERE THEN
CAN WE CAN'T WE DO IT HERE
YEAH WE'RE DOING NOW
BUT IT'S
OH OKAY
NICE
YES
'KAY WE'VE MADE A PROTOTYPE
UM WE'VE GOT UH
UH OUR ASPECTS FROM THE LAST MEETING
UH ESPECIALLY WE LOOKED AT THE FORM MATERIAL AND THE COLOUR
UM WE'VE UH DRAWN HERE THE P PROTOTYPE
THE LOGO IS UH
IS UH
IS PRETTY UH OBVIOUS TO SEE ON THE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL BUT
IT IS NECESSARY WHEN YOU WANT TO BUILD YOUR UH COMPANY F TO A LEVEL HIGHER
UM
OUR INTERFACE ELEMENTS THERE ARE SHOWN IN THE IN THE DRAWING
MAYBE YOU CAN UH POINT THEM UH
THE FUNCTIONS
BUT UH THAT IT'S UH HERE THEN IN THE MIDDLE
YES UM
WE'VE DISC
MOST OF THE USERS
YES Y THERE THERE WILL BE A P A LITTLE A LITTLE P. ON THAT AND A LITTLE UH YEAH
YES
IT'S A TELEVISION
YES
YES YES YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A LOT OF STANDARD BUTTONS THAT HAS TO BE UH ON IT
UH TH WITH THE ONE AND A DOUBLE UH UH YES
YES YOU HAVE TELEVISIONS THEN YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO UH PRESS
YES BUT BUT A LOT UH
YES BUT
SOME TELEVISIONS DON'T ACCEPT UH THAT THAT
NO NO BUT S
YES BUT SOME SOME OLD TELEVISIONS UH YOU HAVE TO UH CLICK ON UH A SPECIAL BUTTON
UH THEN YOU GO TO A A NEXT LEVEL YOU CAN PUSH TWO BUTTONS
YOU WANT
YES BUT SOME TELEVISION DON'T SUPPORT IT
NO A REMOTE CAN
YES SO THEY NEED NO THEY NEED
NO BUT UH
YEAH IT
AND THE BUTTON FOR THE SCART UH AUDIO VIDEO UH EXTERNAL INPUT
NO NO
UH REMOTE CONTROL SENDS ONE SIGNAL AT ONE BUTTON UH PRESS
UH SOME
N SOME TELEVISIONS WHEN WHEN YOU WANT TO GO FURTHER THAN UH TEN
NO YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO UH GIVE THE TELEVISION UH TWO OR MORE SIGNALS
WHEN YOU UH PRESS ONE BUTTON YOU GIVE ONE SIGNAL
AND THE OLDER TELEVISIONS NEED MORE SIGNALS TO GO A LEVEL HIGHER
BUT
WHEN YOU MAKE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT IT WILL UH GIVE MORE SIGNALS
IT COULD WORK BUT
JUST A BASIC IDEA OF OF OF THE MOST UH MOST Y
MOST COMMON UH AND SIMPLE UH OPERATIONS ON THE REMOTE
YES
IT'S HERE ON THE
WE CAME UH
YES
BUT MAYBE WE CAN MAYBE WE CAN MAKE THE DOCKING STATION UH UH A BIT STANDARD FOR FOR UH THE OTHER PRODUCTS WE SELL
BECAUSE REAL REAL REACTION SELLS MORE PRODUCTS THAN ONLY REMOTE CONTROLS
SO MAYBE WE CAN UH USE THE DOCKING STATION FOR EXAMPLE UH M. P. THREE PLAYERS OR OR UH
UH HEARING DEVICES
YES BUT WHEN YOU PUT THAT SAME VOLT VOLTAGES ON IT
YOU CAN PUT UH WHEN THE WHEN THE WHEN UH O THE THE THE LOWEST PART OF IT
WHEN IT'S O THE SAME AS THE OTHER PRODUCTS YOU CAN PUT IT ALL ON THE SAME UH
YES BUT WE CAN MAKE
NO WE CAN MAKE UH MAKE THE MOST LOWEST PART ALL THE SAME
WHEN WHEN THE THE RECHARGER HAS A HAS A BIT WHAT POINTS OUT WE CAN PLACE ALL ON TOP OF IT
JUST HAVE TO BE BIG ENOUGH FOR THE BIGGEST
NO WHEN YOU MAKE IT LARGE ENOUGH NO IT IT WILL NOT
BUT THEN IT'S A LITTLE BIT
BUT IT'S JUST AN IDEA
BUT IT'S FLAT IT'S FLAT AS AS THIS SO WE CAN P MAKE ALL THE PRODUCTS AS FLAT AS THIS
YES BUT WHEN YOU MAKE UH UH A BIT OF BIG
YES LITTLE HOLER LITTLER UH LITTLE PRODUCTS GO DEEPER IN IT
YES
AND UH UH
THE F THE LOOK AND FEEL WOULD BE GREAT ON THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE UH YOU ALWAYS UH WILL UH PICK UP THE REMOTE CONTROL IN THE IN THE SMALLEST UH AREA
THEN YOUR UH LEFT THUMB OF UH YOUR RIGHT THUMB IS UH NEAR THE PROGRAMME UH BUTTON
WHICH IS THE MOST COMMON USED UH FUNCTION AND ALL THE OTHER BUTTONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR UH THUMB
SO IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY GOOD DESIGN
YES UH ON THE SIDE UH THERE WILL BE A STRIP OF RUBBER
AND IN THE MIDDLE UH THERE IS UH A HARD UH A HARD MATERIAL A BIT HARD PLASTIC WITH A LIGHT UH BEHIND IT
YES WE CAN MAKE ALSO N NEON LIGHTS ON IT OR OR THE BUTTONS THAT CAN MAKE UH LIGHT ON IT
YES
BUT IT WILL ALSO UH UH USE BATTERIES AND DO WE WANT TO
THE ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE INTERFACE BUTTONS WERE UH
YES
YES
YES MAYBE WE CAN USE ON THE ON THE LIGHTS ON THE SIDE WE CAN USE UH UH MULTIPLE UH LIGHTS SO IT WILL UH
YES
NO
YEAH
I THINK I THINK THE THE FRONTS WILL GIVE IT A MORE UH UH UH LESS UGLIER UH SIDE
BECAUSE YOU CAN UH MAKE IT IN YOUR OWN YES YOU CAN MAKE IT IN YOUR OWN UH
MORE TO YOUR OWN PERSONALITY OR OR HOUSE STYLE
YES
OR FORTY
I THINK TWO OR THREE
YES
YES
YES
YES
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BUTTONS
ALSO THE THE THE BUTTONS OF THE ONE THE TWO THE THE DIGITS O THEY'RE USED UH UH
CAN YES THREE TWO
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT THEM BECAUSE
YES
YES
A ONE
WE WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE IT UH THE THE BEST TRENDY LOOK UH EVER
YES
YES
NO
NO NOT L. C. D. SO
BUT THAT THAT'S NOT INNOVATIVE
LIGHTS LIGHTS ARE
SIX
BECAUSE WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT INNOVATIVE BUT IT BUT IT
WITH THE LIGHTS IT IT'S IT'S KIND OF FUTURE
BUT STILL YOU CAN RETRIEVE IT WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S GONE WITH THE WITH
YES
THE DOCKING STATION IS A IS A LITTLE BIT INNOVATIVE
IT'S A PART OF THE REMOTE
AND WITH THE SPEAKER ON THE THERE'S ALSO A SPEAKER
OKAY
BUT THE RETRIEVAL OR THE
YES HOW WOULD YOU INNOVATE A REMOTE CONTROL MORE
TO PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD
YES
YES
YOU LIKE THE BUTTONS
YES
IN IN AND COMPARING WITH UH PEOPLE OF TH OF THE AGE ABOVE
WE DON'T KNOW
BUT
YES TWO BUT ONLY IN C WHEN YOU COMPARE IT WITH WITH ELDERLY
THIS IS JUST GUESSING
MAKE IT A TWO
WHEN IT SUCCEEDS UH IT CAN GET A TWO MU
A LOGO
YES UH ENCRYPTED UH WITH
YES
YES
IS THERE SOMETHING AFTER THIS UH MEETING
OR
OKAY
YES
UH IT'S IT'S ONE ONE CHIP BUT BUT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE FROM IT
THE SIMPLE CHIP IS E ENOUGH I I THINK BUT WITH THE LIGHTS WITH THE LIGHTS AND THE RETRIEVAL IT CAN BE UH
NO UH I
YES MY MY MY UH
THE THE EMAIL I GOT SAID UH SIMPLE CHIP BUT WHEN WE PUT IN THE SPEAKER AND THE RETRIEVER UH DEVICE
IT WILL UH COST A A BIT MORE LIKE I THINK THE ADVANCED CHIP MAYBE
BEC NO THE THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT A RETRIEVER OR A SPEAKER UH IN IT
THEN IT'S A SIMPLE CHIP
YES I I I S I
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR FUTURE UH RECOMMENDATIONS
I DON'T KNOW IT UH EITHER
YES
OTHERWISE YOU GET UH A STANDARD UH PLASTIC COLOUR
STANDARD RUBBER
ST
YES
NO IT'S ONLY UH WHEN YOU USE PUSH BUTTONS IT WILL COST THAT MUCH
IF YOU USE A SCROLL WHEEL
MAYBE IT'S THE KIND OF PUSH BUTTONS
YOU CAN HAVE F FOUR KIND OF PUSH BUTTONS
RUBBER
YOU CAN HAVE UH
DIFFERENT YES
WHY IS THAT SO UH EXPENSIVE
SO WHE WHEN YOU SO THEN IT
IT'S EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PRICE OF THE OF THE AMOUNT OF
WHEN YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF BUTTON YOU HAVE TO PUT IN WI IN YOUR CARTON
BOARD
AND THEN THROW IT
BUT WHE
I'VE SEEN ONE UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL WITH ONLY THE PU YEAH ONLY WITH UH PAGE UP PAGE DOWN AND VOLUME BUT BUT
UH IT'S IT'S STILL FOR LITTLE CHILDREN
THEY CAN HANDLE THAT REMOTE CONTROL BUT BUT IT ISN'T FO
YES IT'S FOR IT'S LI UH IT'S JUST FOR A LITTLE
OTHERWISE IT
OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE THE
SPECIAL FORM ALSO IT SAYS
WHAT IS THE NORMAL MATERIAL
SH YEAH
CLASSIC
OH PLASTIC
BUT WE CAN UH SELL THE REMOTE CONTROL AND UH SELL THE DOCKING STATION YES
AND AND BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO TELL IT
BUT WHAT WE CAN SAY OF CAN UM ALMOST MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUY A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT THE DOCKING STATION
NO BUT YOU OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE IT
BUT FOR TWO EUROS AND THIRTY CENTS WE UH WE DON'T GET A DOCKING STATION
FOR
FOR TWO EUROS
IT ISN'T IN MY INFORMATION SO I DON'T KNOW IT UH EITHER
IT ISN'T IN MY INFORMATION I UH I I'VE GOT A
SCHEMATIC VIEW OF THE REMOTE CONTROL BUT NOTHING ABOUT UH ADVANCED CHIPS OR
UH I'VE GOT HERE IN UH I WILL PUT A I WILL PUT A PAGE ON IT
WHEN MY MOUSE WORKS AGAIN
MY MOUSE IS UH
YES
OH
AH I'VE GOT IT
I WILL PUT UH
MY EMAIL ON THE
THE NETWORK
IT'S ON IT
YES
UM
YES THAT WAS MINE
BUT THAT WAS MY SECOND
MM
BUT THIS IS THE SAME UH
THIS IS O ONLY THE POSSIBILITIES
YEAH
WE CAN USE A SIMPLE A REGULAR OR ADVANCED CHIP
AH OKAY
WITH THE LIGHT
L. C. D.
MAYBE YOU CAN SAY AGAINST THE REMOTE UH PAGE UH F UH PAGE UP PAGE DOWN
ALL IN TWELVE EUROS
TWELVE EUROS AND FIFTY CENTS
AND THE LIGHTS
WHERE UH ARE THE LIGHTS
BUT BUT SOMETIMES YOU PUT A
KINETICS AREN'T UH NOWADAYS ONLY USED IN WATCHES AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS WALKING
UH SOLAR CELLS ARE USELESS
FO FOR A DOCKING STATION
WITH A CABLE WITH UH BUTTONS ON IT WITH RETRIEVAL UH DEVICE IN IT
WI WITH A BUTTON TO
WI WITH A BUTTON TO RETRIEVE IT SO IT WILL BEEP
UH SO IT'S UH WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY
LOOK AT THE CASE THE CASE THE CASE OF OF UH OF UH
NO THEN WE HAVE TO SELL IT FOR THIRTY EUROS
IT'S THE
MAYBE WE CAN UH CAN DO IT BOTH
MAYBE WE CAN DO IT BOTH UH IN THE IN THE IN THE REMOTE
BATTERY AND KINETIC
YES BUT WHEN IT'S THEN WHEN IT THEN YOU HAVE TO SHAKE IT UH AND ALL WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S EMPTY
YOU ASKED FOR THREE D
NO THAT'S N THAT'S NOT TRUE
UH A WATCH IS UH KINETIC BECAUSE YOU WALK ALL THE TIME
YES SOLAR CELLS ARE ALSO STATED
WHY DON'T WE USE SOLAR CELLS THEN
THAT'S TRUE
OUI
YOU CAN DO IT FOR FIFTY CENTS
THE C THE CASE THE CASE ALONE IS IS IS UH
THE CASE ALONE FOR UH REMOTE CONTROL IS AT LEAST ONE EURO
THEN WE HAVE ONE EURO THIRTY FOR THE WHOLE DOCKING STATION
BUT NOW
GREAT
IT'S GREAT
OUR REMOTE CONTROL
YES
SEVENTY EUROS
WHY NOT A HAND DYNAMO THEN
WE'RE DONE
IS THIS IT
OKAY
YES
WHERE'S THE CHAMPAGNE
I DON'T UH HEAR A BELL
BYE
UH-HUH
JUST FILL THAT ONE IN
ALRIGHT I
YEAH
ALRIGHT AND UH YOU GOTTA POINT OUT WHICH IS THE VOLUME UM UH BUTTON AND WHICH IS THE PROGRAMME BUTTON
YEAH BUT YOU YOU GOTTA MAKE IT CLEAR ON THE ON
YEAH AND A AND A TRIANGLE ON THAT
YES
NEXT TO THAT I KINDA MISS A ZERO ACTUALLY
ALL N NO THAT'S UM KINDA DEPENDENT ON THE TELEVISION
I THINK
YEAH I THINK YOU SHOULD ADD
A CROSS OR WHATEVER
YEAH LINE
NO THAT'S DEPENDENT ON THE TELEVISION
I DO KNOW SO
YEAH
YES BUT UH UH NO UH REMOTE CONTROL NOWADAYS ARE UM THEY COME WITH THE TELEVISION
OR ACTUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND
BUT
YEAH
YEAH WELL BUT SU IF
NO NO NO
SO SOME TELEVISION RESPOND DIFFERENTLY
LOOK IF UH I I
YES
YES THAT'S TRUE
NO
NO IT IT IT WORKS UH IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT UH A SPECIAL BUTTON FOR IT UH IF YOU PUSH A ONE
THEN ON YOUR TELEVISION THERE WILL APPEAR A ONE AND A A LINE WHICH IS AN EMPTY SPACE
YEP
TRUE
NO S SOME SOME TELEVISIONS NEED THE INPUT FIRST UH AND AND YOU C
NO THAT'S NOT TRUE
IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE
IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE
UH
NO REMOTE CONTROL DOESN'T GIVE SIGNAL AFTER FIVE SECONDS
REMOTE CONTROL IS A STUPID THING
IF YOU PUSH A BUTTON IT SENDS IT IMMEDIATELY TO TO THE TELEVISION
NO DEFINITELY NOT
DEFINITELY NOT
YES
UH YOU CAN ACCESS THAT UH VIA ZERO AND THEN MINUS I GUESS
YEAH
YEP
OKAY
I KINDA MISS THE DOCKING STATION
NO NOTHING REALLY TRENDY ABOUT IT
THE BUTTON
YEP
I THINK THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT SHAPES OF UH UH DEVICES
YEAH OF COURSE
MM-HMM
WELL IT IT GOT IT IT HAS GOT TO FIT INTO THE SHAPE OF COURSE
THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE VOLTAGE CAN BE THE SAME
THAT'S UH THAT'S TRUE
BUT UH I IF YOU ALL MAKE THE M HAVING A BOTTOM LIKE THIS THEN THEY ALL FIT
YEAH THAT'S TRUE BUT UH
YES BUT UH I I G
SHOULDN'T IT FALL THEN
IT ISN'T GOING TO FALL DOWN
THAT'S A BIT UH YEAH I THINK
NO BUT IF IF LIKE THIS I'LL I'LL POINT IT OUT
IF YOU GOT UH A A A BASE A BASE LIKE THIS I WON'T DRAW IT REALLY
IF YOU GOT A BASE WHICH IS UH AS BIG AS THIS
YEAH SURE BUT IF YOU GOT IF YOU GOT A TINY PLAYER IT CAN
YEAH
UH WHA WHAT YOU COULD DO IF YOU UH FROM THE BOTTOM OH RIGHT HELP
UH YOU COULD MAKE LIKE A HOLE IN IT YOU KNOW OF UH IN IN THE
YEAH
THAT I THAT IS POSSIBLE YEP
YEAH SURE YOU'RE RIGHT
OH
I DON'T LIKE THE COLOURS
MM-HMM
YEAH
ALRIGHT
THE LIGHT
OKAY
AND OTHER LIGHTS
NO O ON THE ON THE FRONT
YEAH OKAY
MAYBE THE UH THE LOGO
YEAH WHY NOT
OF COURSE
OKAY
UH IN THE SAME COLOUR AS THE SIDE
YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT'LL BE GOOD
YES
YEP
YEAH
WE WILL
WELL UH YEAH I I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING RIGHT THERE YEAH
WE GOTTA DO THAT ON THE RIGHT THE MOST RIGHT MOST SCREEN BECAUSE THE LEFTMOST
YEP THAT'S ME
ALRIGHT
I WILL BE NEEDING THAT IMAGE SO LEAVE IT PLEASE
UM
GO AWAY
RIGHT WE'RE GONNA EVALUATE THAT DESIGN ACCORDING TO A FEW POINTS
UM WE G THE FOUR OF US ARE GOING TO DO THAT UM TOGETHER
I WANNA HAVE A COLOUR OVER HERE COME ON
RIGHT THE REMOTE IS NOT UGLY A BIT WEIRD SENTENCE BUT
THE POSITIVE THINGS HAS TO BE ON THE LEFT SO I SAID NOT UGLY INSTEAD OF UGLY
UH WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WE WE GOTTA GIVE POINTS TO UH TO ALL OF THESE TO EVALUATE UH THAT DESIGN
AND PLEASE FORGET THE DRAWING SKILLS OF THESE GUYS
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS NOT UGLY
HOW DO YOU FEEL
YES
BACKGROUND COLOUR
HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL
THE DIFFERENT DESIGNS
YES
OKAY
NO NOT NOT FRONTS BUT DIFFERENT DESIGNS
AND THAT'S STILL UH UH YEAH IS IS UH IS A LITTLE PERSONAL TOUCH I GUESS
WHAT
YEAH WHA WHA WHAT WOULD YOU UH GUYS UH THINK
PERSONALLY
PERSONALLY
YES BUT WHAT IS IT
GUIDO
TWO OR THREE
I WAS
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THREE SO I GUESS
THREE IS UH A BIT UH OH WHAT AM I DOING
I'LL MARK IT
THE REMOTE CONTROL'S UH UH THAT N MAKES UH ZAPPING EASY
YEAH
ANTEK YOU AGREE
YEAH
YOU'RE NOT ANTEK
I TOTALLY AGREE
THE REMOTE CONTROL THE REMOTE CONTROL'S RELEVANT BUTTONS ARE PROMINENTLY VISIBLE
YEAH I YEAH
I WOULD SAY A ONE BECAUSE UH EVERY BUTTON IS UH UH RELEVANT
AND OUR OH YEAH IT'S A B YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
THAT'S A ONE
YOU AGREE
THE REMOTE CONTROL HASN'T GOT TOO MUCH REDUNDANT OR UNNEEDED BUTTONS
I THINK WE TOTALLY SUCCEEDED THERE
OH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
THAT'S TRUE
THE THE YEAH M WELL YOU D YOU'VE GOT A POINT
TWO OR THREE
TWO
ANTEK
NAY THAT THAT THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE
THEY'RE DEFINITELY NEEDED
SO
WE PUT IT ON A TWO
THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS GOT A REALLY TRENDY LOOK
MAARTEN
YEAH
EVER YEAH
GUIDO
YEAH UH I AGREE
I AGREE
I WAS PLANNING TO GIVE IT A TWO UH WHERE I GIVE THE NOT UGLY UH OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YOU AGREE ON THE TWO
GREAT
REMOTE CONTROL HASN'T GOT TOO MUCH REDUNDANT OR UNNEEDED BUTTONS
UH I COPIED THAT ONE
WELL UH FORGET THAT
UM
GO AWAY
REMOTE CONTROL HAS GOT INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IMPLANTED
YEAH AND THE LIGHT
WELL I G
IT'S NOT SEVEN
WHY UH WHY NOT A SEVEN
HOW
YEAH YOU THINK THE LIGHTS ARE INNOVATIVE
WELL IT'S N TRUE
UH I AGREE M BUT
I'LL
YEAH YOU YOU DIDN'T DRAW THE DOCKING STATION
YEAH IT IT'S I THINK I THINK WITH ITS
I THINK MORE M
UH THAT THAT'S N
NO UH WELL THE AGENDA SAYS EVALUATE NOW SO I THINK WE
IT'S IT'S A SIX
THAT M F YEAH FOR THE RETRIEVAL FUNCTION
YEAH
I THINK THAT'S VERY INNOVATIVE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH SURE BUT
BUT I D I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK IT'S A FIVE BUT
REMOTE CONTROL IS EASY TO USE
I THINK A TWO
YEAH
COME ON
THE REMOTE CONTROL HASN'T GOT UH
I'VE JUST FILLED UH
GO AWAY
I FOUND TWELVE QUESTIONS SO MUCH BUT IT STILL IS TEN
IT WILL BE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY
NO NO NO
NO JUST IF THEY IF THEY BUY IT
YEAH WHAT DO YOU THINK
ANTEK
NO THAT'S NO COMPARISON
AND I DON'T MEAN TWO PEOPLE
W W
RIGHT THE REM
THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS RECOGNISABLE CORPORATE IMAGE COLOUR LOGO OR SLOGAN
OH THE SLOGAN
CAN WE SEE THE SLOGAN
ARE WE GONNA DO THAT
THREE
I AGREE
BECAUSE OF THE SLOGAN REMOTE CONTROL'S GOT A BASIC DESIGN INTENDED UH FOR NOVICE USERS
TWO
TWO
ALRIGHT
WE GOTTA ADD UP THE SCORES NOW TO SEE OUR TOTAL AVERAGE
FOUR FIVE SEVEN NINE
FORGET THAT
FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SIX
TWENTY SIX
IT'S A TWO POINT SIX
ALRIGHT WE YEAH
YEAH
TRUE
THIS WAS MY EVALUATION
SO
WE DID A PRETTY NICE JOB UNTIL NOW
UM IS THIS YOUR
WHATEVER
WELL I THINK WE GOTTA FILL OUT ANOTHER QUESTIONNAIRE
YEAH
A FIVE
A FIVE
DOESN'T MATTER
WE PROBABLY WILL
THE AMOUNT YEAH
I DON'T KNOW
I HAVEN'T GOT AN IDEA ON ON WHICH WE NEED TO USE REALLY
YEAH
YEAH
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
I MEAN YOU GOT THAT EMAIL
DID IT POINT OUT WHAT TO USE THEM FOR
ALRIGHT WELL POINT OUT THE ADVANCED CHIP FOR NOW I GUESS
I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S VERY SPECIAL
ALRIGHT THAT'S OKAY
NO
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE IT SAYS AMOUNT
THE THE THE YELLOW ROW IS THE AMOUNT OF
TO N THAT'S TOTAL OF FOUR BUTTONS
I THINK THAT
EIGHTEEN
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SI
FIFTY CENTS FOR ONE SINGLE STUPID BUTTON
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
I CAN'T I I I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT IF IT WAS FIFTY CENTS PER UH UH PER BUTTON
REALLY
YEAH YEAH
NO REALLY
YEAH BUT I D I WOULDN'T WANT TO OWN THAT
REALLY
YEAH
I DON'T THINK THE SPECIAL FORM IS REALLY TRUE
IS IT
YEAH I DUNNO
PLASTIC
NO
YEAH I REALLY DON'T GET IT
I MEAN IF IT'S A SIMPLE CHIP THEN WE SUDDENLY GOT TWO EUROS AND THIRTY CENTS
YEAH YEP
I THINK SO TOO
OH I DON'T KNOW
UH WHY
I MEAN I I IF YOU IF IT WOULD COST TWO EUROS THAT HAD A TOTAL A TOTAL THING
IT WOULD BE NICE TOO I MEAN UH WE'RE NOT GONNA ADD UH A TRIP TO HAWAII TO IT
I LIKE THE HAND DYNAMO PART
WE CAN MAKE A PLAIN DOCKING STATION FOR TWO EUROS
I MEAN
WI WI WITHOUT RECHARGE
YEAH BUT BUT WE CAN MAKE A DOCKING STATION FOR TWO EUROS UH IF YOU DON'T PUT THE RECHARGE FUNCTION IN IT
I MEAN
IT HAS A SHAPE
OF COURSE IT HAS A SHAPE BUT I I
WHY SHOULD THAT NOT BE POSSIBLE
NO FOR FOR THE UH FOR THE DOCKING STATION IF YOU DO IF YOU CHOOSE THE SIMPLE CHIP
YES
DEAD
REANIMATE IT
WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE
OH WHATEVER
THIS ISN'T HELPFUL
NO THAT WAS MY PRESENTATION
IT'S ALREADY OPEN
IT'S AT THE BOTTOM
IT'S UH AT YOUR TASK BAR
OH
SORRY
OKAY SORRY
YEAH NICE
I IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
THAT'S NOT NEEDED
A DISPLAY UH IS OF COURSE UH FOR SHOWING LETTERS
FOR SHOWING TEXT
I DON'T THINK THAT UH JUST A L A LITTLE LIGHT
YEAH I AGREE
YEAH I GUESS SO TOO
NEXT CHANNEL
NO
WELL WE MIGHT WANT IT BUT
YEAH
GREAT
DELETE

NO I DON'T THINK SO
WELL WHAT IS IT HUH
YEAH DIFFICULT ENGLISH WORD
I DIDN'T KNEW IT MYSELF

IT DOESN'T DRAW UH CIRCLES UH THAT EASY UH
YEAH JUST A BIT A BIT CHILDISH A BIT
WELL UH SAVE THE DOCUMENT AND THEN UH
AND THEN A A NEW BLANK DOCUMENT FOR
UH WILL UH CHOOSE A NEW COLOUR AND A NEW PEN WIDTH SO W WE CAN ALL SEE IT
NO WELL FIRST YEAH
AND THEN YOU GO TO FORMAT I THINK AND CURRENT COLOUR YOU CHOOSE A NEW COLOUR
AND A NEW PEN WIDTH UH ALSO FORMAT
IT'S NOT LIKE IN PAINT
LINE WIDTH
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE A NICE ONE

OUR PROFIT AIM IS WORLDWIDE FIFTY MILLION EUROS
SO I DIDN'T UH EXACTLY UH CALCULATE HOW MUCH WE HAVE TO SELL
WE WANT TO KEEP IT OUR COSTS AT TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS SO
KEEP UH THAT IN MIND WHEN WE UH TALK ABOUT OUR UH MATERIALS AN F AND STUFF AND UH MARKETING UH RESEARCH
NOW THEN WE ALL UH WE CAN UH SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS UH WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT OUR CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
FIRST ABOUT DESIGN UH ABOUT UH AIM IN THE MARKET
ETCETERA
WELL UH WE C WE CAN SIT DOWN UH BECAUSE UH PRESENTATION CAN WAIT
WE CAN UH TAKE NOTES AND UH

YEP
WELL YEAH
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BUT WE CAN
WELL EXCEPT IF WE DELIVER IT TOGETHER WITH OUR D. V. D.
YEAH BECAUSE WE LOOK AT COMPETITORS AND W IF WE PICK UP THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THAT AND GIVE IT A NICE DESIGN
YES
YEP
YEAH
OO
N WE CAN USE UH IT AS A AS A GAME PAD
SO ONE HAND HAS THE BEER SO THE OTHER HAND UH
WELL I WE ALREADY UH ONE OF OUR AIMS IS THAT IT HAS TO BE ORIGINAL AND TRENDY SO

SO THE THE FORM WILL HAVE BEEN UH TESTED OUT SO
YES
WELL FOR ME PERSONALLY I HAVE A A LOT OF REMOTES UH AT HOME BUT THOSE ONES THAT HAVE A A ROUND ENDING AND UH WELL UH JUST AN UH SQUARE UH MIDDLE I DON'T LIKE TO USE THEM

SO IT HAS TO BE MADE IN THE BUTTONS I THINK
IT HAS TO UH NOT BE LOOSE
YEAH
IS THERE AN A UNIVERSAL UH UNIVERSAL WAY OF UM TRANSMITTING FROM THE REMOTE TO THE TELEVISION SO IT'S ALL ABOUT UH
IT'S NOT THAT IN CHINA IT'S DIFFERENT
YEAH
BUT Y YOU CAN HAVE UH OF COURSE DIFFERENT BETWEEN D. V. D. S AND TELEVISIONS AND BETWEEN

WELL I'M AMAZED UH ABOUT YOUR UH DRAWING SKILLS
YEAH
I AM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
CHIEF I AM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
YEAH
I THINK
IT'S PR IT RESEMBLES THE ANIMAL DRAWN BY
I THINK CAN I SAY IT
IT LOOKS AMAZING
THESE ARE VERY IMPOR
THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS OF COURSE UH THESE DRAWINGS UH

I FEEL TOTALLY AT EASE
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO
ALRIGHT
WELL I I DIDN'T HAVE TO PREPARE ANYTHING ABOUT UH IT'S NOT
IT'S IT'S NOT MY TASK TO UH TALK ABOUT UH EXPERIENCE WITH CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS BUT UH
MM-HMM
NO BUT UH THE B THE BUTTONS HAVE TO UH HAVE TO HAVE UH INTERNATIONAL RECOGNISABLE BUTTONS AND UH
AND NUMBERS AND UH THAT EVERY CULTURE IN UH YEAH PEOPLE IN EVERY COUNTRY CAN RECOGNISE
ALRIGHT
YEAH SO IT DOESN'T UH BECOME TOO COMPLICATED WITH TOO MUCH BUTTONS AND UH
AND STEREO UH S UH AUDIO INSTALLATIONS
MOST PEOPLE DO YEAH
IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
YEAH
WELL
HMM
IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT AND FAMILIAR AT THE SAME TIME
YEAH THE SHAPE WILL WILL HAVE TO BE RECOGNISED
I THOUGHT ABOUT UH LIKE MOST UH REMOTE CONTROLS UH ARE UH A LONG BOX SHAPED THING YOU CAN MAKE IT UH TRIANGLE SHAPED
BUT THAT'S NOT UH VERY RECOGNISABLE
OVAL
I
MM
OH BUT IT HA IT HAS TO BE M YEAH
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO KNOW IT'S A REMOTE AND NOT ANOTHER
YEAH
YEAH SO THE LONG BOX UH SHAPED THING MUST BE UH YEAH USEFUL
OR ELSE UH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ANO ANOTHER SHAPE

A BIG RECOGNISABLE BUTTON ON TOP OR SOMETHING
THE BUTTONS SHOULD UH ALSO BE NOT TOO SMALL NOT TOO BIG OF COURSE AND UH N UH UH NOT TOO CLOSE UH TOGETHER
UH-HUH
YEAH OF COURSE UH TO UH TO UH TO HAVE ICONS TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS
YEAH
COLOURS YEAH
I THINK WE HAVE TO TALK ALSO ABOUT UH THE THE MATERIALS FOR UM
ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING THA
MM-HMM
YEAH NOW WE CAN STILL TALK ABOUT THE MATERIAL WE HAVE SOME SOME MINUTES LEFT UH I W WROTE DOWN UH THAT THE CASE SHOULD BE PLASTIC OF COURSE
HARD PLASTIC THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE UH RUBBERY I THINK UH
NO N N
MM
ALRIGHT
AND OF COURSE THERE ARE SEVERAL ELECTRICAL CABLES IN IT TO UH TO CONNECT THINGS UH TO EACH OTHER
I THINK SO
IT'S A A COMMON STAN STANDARD WAY INFRARED BEAMS AN INFRARED BEAM I THINK
IT IT'S A WE WE MAKE AN A UNIVERSAL REMOTE SO IT HA HAS TO WORK WITH UH ALL KINDS OF BRANDS AND THINGS
AND HAVE WELL YEAH I'VE WROTE SOMETHING DOWN ABOUT HOW IT WORKS
THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON AND WITH AN INFRARED BEAM IT SIGNALS THE TELEVISION SET ACCORDINGLY BUT THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS I THINK
WELL BUT TH BUT THE STANDARD FRONT WILL BE UH JUST GREY OR SOMETHING UH B A SIMPLE COLOUR NOT NOT VERY FLASHY
PINK TELEVISION SETS PINK REMOTE
ALRIGHT
I MUST NOT FORGET MY PEN THE NEXT TIME

IT'S A CAT
IT'S A PIG
RIGHT
NO IT LOOKS GREAT
JUST SAVE IT
OH GREAT
IT'S GOOD FOR GROUP SPIRIT
RIGHT
RIGHT
I THINK IT'S IM IT'S IMPORTANT TO UH LOOK AT UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS OF OUR COMPETITORS
GET THE GOOD POINTS UH TRY TO MERGE THEM INTO ONE UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL
ON OUR CORPORATE SITE I SAW UH A NEW D. V. D. PLAYER UH WE'RE GONNA PRODUCE
MAYBE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT COMPATIBLE WITH THE D. V. D. PLAYER
SO YOU CAN UH USE YOUR TELEVISION AND YOUR D. V. D. PLAYER WITH THE SAME UH REMOTE CONTROL
FURTHERMORE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT UH ACCEPTABLE FOR THE WHOLE WORLD FOR DIFFERENT CULTURES MAYBE BECAUSE WE WANT TO WE WANT TO WELL FIFTY MILLION
YEAH YEAH SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT
SO
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
MM-HMM
RIGHT
MAYBE WE COULD MAKE ONE BUTTON TO SWITCH BETWEEN D. V. D. PLAYER AND T. V. AND MAKE THE OTHER BUTTONS UH MULTI FUNCTIONAL OR SOMETHING
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH SO BUT TH THAT'S KIND KIND OF STANDARD T. TELEVISION SO IT ALSO WORKS ON THAT
YEAH BUT
WE NEED TO TO KEEP IT CONSISTENT WITH OTHER D UH
YEAH BUT IT'S IT HAS TO BE USEABLE
YEAH
NO
NOT WITH TWO HANDS
YEAH YEAH YEAH RIGHT
NO
YEAH BUT IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THAT IT FITS
YEAH
YEAH
IT SHOULDN'T BE BOXY
NAH
I DON'T AGREE WITH THE LONG BOX UH SHAPE IT IT HAS TO BE CUSTOM MADE FOR THE HAND
YEAH
YEAH BUT IF YOU SHAPE IT
IF
NO THAT'S OL OLD FASHIONED
I CAN IMAGINE THAT US
WELL

HMM
UM
WELL
YEAH BUT IT HAS IT HAS TO FIT YOUR HAND
IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO BOXY YOU KNOW
IT'S
NO NO NO
YEAH
YEAH IT SHOULD BE
RIGHT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR AND THEN A BUTTON HERE TO SWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS LIKE D. V. D. PLAYER AND SO YOU CAN I'VE
YEAH RIGHT AND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS KIND OF IDEA
WITH THE WITH THE NUMBERS AND
RIGHT
BUT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TO UM MAKE IT
AP APPARENT THAT THERE ARE TWO FUNCTIONS FOR EVERY BUTTON
SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME SPACE BETWEEN THE BUTTONS
YEAH
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT AND MAYBE WE SHOULD USE COLOURS
YEAH
THAT'S KINDA TRENDY
YEAH RIGHT
RIGHT
BUT
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S IMPORTANT TO UH NOTATE ALL THE THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE SO WE
YEAH
NO PROBLEM
YEAH
YEAH IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HEAVY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT'S UNIV YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEP
AND YOU CAN USE
YEAH
BUT ARE
ARE WE GOING W UH WITH THE FRONT UH FRONTS UH IDEA
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT UNIVERSAL AND YOU CAN ALWAYS USE A FRONT FRONT ON IT YOU KNOW
YOU CAN USE IT JUST PLAIN BUT YOU CAN
TO MAKE IT MORE TRENDY
RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH YEAH YEAH
BUT PEOPLE OF OFTEN DON'T LIKE BRIGHT COLOURS OR SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT GREY OR S OR BLACK
YEAH BUT THEN YOU CAN USE A A FRONT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH OR A T TELETUBBY FRONT
YEAH YEAH YEAH
I WILL INVESTIGATE
RIGHT
IT'S
YEAH YEAH YEAH JUST IF YOU START UP YOUR INTERNET EXPLORER
YEAH
WELL THAT'S GREAT
THIRTY MINUTES
IT'S TOTALLY BROKEN
OH
WELL I'LL UH START JUST WITH ANOTHER PRESENTATION SO THEN WE CAN UH LOOK AT TH AT THE AGENDA UH FOR THIS MEETING
OKAY
I'VE PUT SOME UH NEW THINGS IN THE IN THE MAP
UH OH
THIS IS IT
I DON'T KNOW THE SHORTCUT SO AH F. FIVE
WELL OUR FUNCTIONAL DESIGN MEETING THAT'S THE STAGE WE'RE IN
AND YOU ALSO HA ALL THREE OF YOU HAVE UH PREPARED SOMETHING ABOUT IT
WELL UM IN WE'LL UH JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE AT THE NOTES FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING WHAT WE UH THOUGHT WE HAD DEC DECIDED
BUT UH
UH THEN WE'LL UH LOOK AT UH THE THREE UH PRESENTATIONS UH FROM YOU
I THINK YOU HAVE PREPARED UH ALL THREE UH
UM WE'LL LOOK AT TH THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS WE UH I DUNNO
Y YOU ALSO HAVE UH RECEIVED THAT MAIL THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS FROM OUR BOSSES
OH I'VE RECEIVED A MAIL WITH UH SOME ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
AND I'LL HAVE A LOOK IF WELL I THINK WE SHOULD SHOW THEM BEFORE YOUR PRESENTATIONS BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY UH
SMART UH TO UH TO INCLUDE SOME THINGS UH WE CAN'T BECAUSE OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS
WELL UM THEN WE CAN MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT OUR REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
WE HAVE TO DEB WE HAVE TO DECIDE IT IN THIS MEETING WHAT OUR FUNCTION WILL BE
AND THEN UH WE CAN DISCUSS UH SOME MORE CLOSELY
UH
UH YEAH I THINK SO
WELL UH THE CLOSING UH WE'LL NOT UH LOOK AT IT YET
UM NOW I'LL LOOK AT SHOW THIS BOARD
UM
WELL UH NOTES FIRST MEETING
NOW
I GAVE A DISC A A PRESENTATION
UH WE FAMILIARISED OURSELF WITH THE BOARDS AND THEN WE DISCUSSED SOME FIRST IDEAS
SO
WE SAID THAT UH
WE HAVE TO MERGE THE STRONG POINTS FROM OUR UH COMPETITORS AND UH LOOK AT THEIR UH REMOTE CONTROLS
WE SHOULD MAKE IT UH COMPATIBLE WITH OUR NEW D. V. D. AND OTHER RELEASES WE HAVE OUR TECHNICAL RELEASES
UH NOT TOO MANY ONE BUTTONS
ONE RECOGNISABLE BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE WHERE YOU DO THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS WITH
AND UM WELL THEY CAN HAVE TWO FUNCTIONS BECAUSE UH YOU HAVE A D. V. D. AND A TELEVISION
UM THE DESIGN HAS TO FIT THE HAND BE ORIGINAL BUT ALSO BE FAMILIAR
IT'S UH ONE OF OUR IDEAS
YEAH WELL THAT WA IT'S JUST THIRTY MINUTES AGO SO IT'S NOT QUITE UH BUT WELL I HAVE TO DO IT
THE MATERIALS UH WELL SHOULD BE HARD PLASTIC WITH RUBBER FROM AND UH WELL THE LABELLING OF THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE INDESTRUCTIBLE
IT SHOULD BE UH RECOGNISABLE AT ALL TIMES
YES
WELL FRONTS WERE TO BE JUST LIKE MOBILE TELEPHONES
AND UH THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS UM AND ALSO LABELLING OF THE BUTTONS THE FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL STANDARDS
WELL THAT'S JUST UH SOME IDEAS FROM THE FIRST MEETING
IT'S QUITE LOGICAL AL ALL OF IT
UM NOW THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS I'LL JUST SHOW THEM
I GOT THIS MAIL
FROM UH OUR BOSSES
WELL TELETEXT GOES OUT
WE WILL NOT USE TELETEXT
MAYBE A NEW SORT OF THING BUT N BUT NOT TELETEXT
WELL
THE SECOND IS A BIT
SH PITY BECAUSE WE JUST SAID WE WANTED TO D INCLUDE THE D. V. D. AND THEY DON'T WANT IT BECAUSE OF OUR TIME WE HAVE FOR THIS PROJECT
SO THAT'S A SHAME BECAUSE UH ESPECIALLY FOR THE THIRD REQUIREMENT WE WANT TO REACH PEOPLE UNDER THE THIRTY YEARS
BECAUSE UH WE DON'T HAVE THOSE CUSTOMERS A LOT AT TH AT THIS POINT
UM WELL IT'S A BIT PITY BECAUSE IT'S JUST THOSE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL FOR ALL THOSE TECHNICAL DEVICES THEY CAN UH REACH IT
YEAH
WELL AND UH OUR CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD STAY REC RECOGNISABLE IN OUR PRODUCTS
SO UH WE HAVE TO UH USE UH MAYBE A SLOGAN MAYBE A COLOUR
AND UM YEAH WELL UH ON OUR REMOTE CONTROLS THE DESIGN HAS TO BE UH WELL AS WE ALREADY SAID A ACTUALLY UH FAMILIAR
UH NOT ONLY JUST UH THE SHAPE BUT ALSO OUR COMPANY
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YES
I I UH NOTED UH OUR UH SLOGAN THAT WE HAVE OUR COMPANY
IT'S UH WE MM PUT THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
SO MAYBE THAT'S A SLOGAN WE CAN PUT UH SOMEWHERE ON OUR REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING
ALRIGHT THEN UM WE'RE GOING TO UH HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS
YOU WANT TO START
OH YOU HAVE TO START
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT UH WHO HAD TO START
WELL S THEN START
OKAY
WELL UH
YOU ALREADY UH OPENED UH POWERPOINT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
WELL
IT SHOULD ACTUALLY UH IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE LOOSE FROM THE TELEVISION BECAUSE IT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR OTHER TELEVISIONS
SO IF YOU DELIVER A SMALL UH CLICK ON DEVICE THAT YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR TELEVISION THAT BLEEPS TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL EVERYONE CAN USE IT
NO YOU CAN CLICK IT ON YOUR TELEVISION
YEAH IN ANOTHER ROOM YEAH
WELL YES
YEAH
WELL WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT IT YEAH
YEP
WELL THERE SH SHOULD ALWAYS BE A MENU BUT IT C CAN BE VERY SHORT
YES OKAY
WELL WE ARE A DESIGN TEAM WE CAN SAY TO SOME UH WRITER UH MAKE A MANUAL POINT
SO
WELL WE'LL HAVE A LOOK
UM YES
YEP
WELL
WELL WITH TWELVE EURO FIFTY AS PRODUCTION COST WE CAN'T UH AFFORD AN L. C. D. UH
YEAH
WELL YEAH WELL UH IT'S YOUR YOUR TASK TO UH LOOK INTO THE COSTS UH OF THOSE UH NIGH I KNOW
IT'S NOT YET A STANDARD UH DEVELOPMENT UH THOSE SO
WE SH
YEAH ABSOLUTELY
YEP
'KAY
ALRIGHT
YES
WELL YOU I C I CAN UH STILL SEE YOUR PRESENTATION
IT'S IN THE WELL UH NEXT UM I DUNNO WHO IS NEXT
YOU UH GOT UH
YES
WELL GO AHEAD
YIP
F. FIVE
F. FIVE
CLICK
YEP
YEAH
SO IT IS ALSO WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE A BUTTON THAT SAYS UH I'M NOW BUSY WITH A D. V. D. UH IF WE HAD DONE THAT
AND A BUTTON FOR T. V.
SO
WELL BUT BUT IF YOU HAVE UM THE MOST USED BUTTONS ALL IN ONE PLACE AND YOU KEEP MAKING THE SAME UM WELL MOVES
BUT IF Y IF YOU WOULD PUT IT AT A DIFFERENT PLACE THEN YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR HANDS AND THAT'S ON OF THE THINGS ABOUT R. S. I.
NO BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS M MAYBE YOU CAN JUST PUT THEM A BIT APART SO YOU WOULD
REJECT R. R. S. I. R. S. I.
YES I'VE SAW THAT ON M ON MI MOBILE TELEPHONES THEY ALSO HAVE UH THOSE BUTTONS
WELL IT IT'S
WELL ALSO I IF SOMEONE PUTS PICKS UP HIS UH REMOTE
YEAH
IF SOMEONE PUTS UP I UH PICKS UP HIS REMOTE AND HE PICKS UP IT HE HE TOUCHES THE SIDE THEN HE'S A ALREADY ON THE NEXT CHANNEL
THAT'S VERY IRRITATING I THINK
WELL
NO
YEP
MM-HMM
THAT'S YOUR PART OF THE JOB
YEP
OKAY
WELL WE UNDERSTAND
WE UNDERSTAND
OH RIGHT NO
NICE
THEN UH MIKE CAN UH GIVE THE THIRD PRESENTATION
HOW LATE IS DID WE START HIS PRESENTATION UH
WHA YEAH
WELL THEN WE HAVE STILL THE TIME SO BUT WE DO HAVE TO COME TO A DECISION RIGHT LATER ON
SO
OH YEAH
UH
OKAY YEAH WELL
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
I LIKE USER CENTRED
YEAH
WE ALSO DO THAT
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL ABSOLUTELY BUT I TH THEY ALL HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT UM THE RECOGNITION FROM OUR COMPANY
SO WE CANNOT JUST UH
MAKE SOMEONE W
NO BUT THAT'S TH THE SIDE THEY LOOK UH LOOK AT IS THE FRONT
SO IF Y IF YOU MAKE A A FRONT WITH JUST A A TIGER ON IT THEN UH OUR RECOGNITION IS TOTALLY GONE
YEAH WE MUST
YEAH WELL AND AND
YES
'KAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
OR THE TH THE THE LOWEST PART OF THE REMOTE ISN'T CHANGED BY THE FRONT
THOSE KIND OF THINGS
YES
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
ALRIGHT
YEAH
WELL WHAT IF WE UM I AT I AT HOME HAVE A REMOTE THAT HAS UM THE MOST FAMILIAR UH BUTTONS ON THE TOP
AND THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE FRONT HAS A LITTLE CLIP
A F A LITTLE UH YOU CAN CLICK AWAY AND THEN YOU HAVE F MUCH MORE FUNCTIONS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T USE BUT S SOME DO DO
WELL BUT BECAUSE YOU SAY THEY THEIR FEATURES ARE IMPORTANT THEY WANT M UM A LOT BUT NOT
YEAH
COMPETITORS
YEAH
WELL MAYBE W WE COULD UH S ON UM SOME UH CALCULATORS YOU HAVE LO THOSE LITTLE LITTLE L. C. D. TH THAT YOU CAN CLICK ON OR SOMETHING
OR THAT YOU CAN CLICK UH OUT UH OF THE REMOTE
AND IF IF THAT'S GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF STA STATUS INFORMATION
YEAH
THOSE KIND OF THINGS UH BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE THOSE UH THOSE PROGRAM RECOGNITION FOR YOUR V. V. C. R. S
AND UH WELL IF Y IF YOUR REMOTE PICKS THAT UP ALSO YOU THEY CAN DISPLAY WHICH PROGRAMME YOU'RE CURRENTLY WATCHING
YEAH
FOR EXAMPLE
IT IT COULD BE SUCH A LITTLE UH TH THAT YOU CAN CLICK IN AND OUT AND YOU AND YOU HAVE IT
YEAH
WELL MAYBE
YEAH
YEAH
R. D. S. S OR SOMETHING
WELL I THINK IT'S YOU GOT IT JUST MEANS IT'S A SCRIPT THAT'S UH KEEPS IT UH ROLLING
AND IT'S NOT UH THAT'S FIVE MINUTES OFF UH IMPLEMENTING TIME I THINK UH
YEAH
NO
UH WELL I THINK SO YES
UM
WE'RE G NO BUT WE'RE WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT
UM WE CAN USE THIS BOARD AGAIN I THINK
UH WE CAN PUT SOME UM DECISIONS ABOUT UM THE CONTROLS WE WANT TH THE ISSUE
WHERE IS MY PRESENTATION
UH
UH
WELL
I MEAN WE'RE ALL HERE NOW I THINK
THESE I'VE ALREADY GIVEN YOU
SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE DIFFERENT REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
SO WE WANT TO HAVE A SMALL L. C. D. SCREEN THAT'S SPECIAL
YES
YEAH
THAT THING IS TERRIBLE
UH
WELL
WELL I TH I THINK MIKE MIKE HAS A POINT
BECAUSE UM WHEN WHEN UH WHEN I USE A REMOTE I L I HATE THE BUTTONS BUT BUTTONS AT THE AT THE BOTTOM
SO AND AND I I LIKE TO USE THE ONES
ON THE TOP
SO WHEN I U WHEN I HAVE TO HAVE AN L. C. D. S SCR WINDOW
YES BUT WE WE WE WE DON'T WANT THAT
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO LOOK LIKE A CALCULATOR
WE WANT TO LOOK IT LIKE OUR ORIGINAL BUT FAMILIAR
YEA
MAYBE A BIC UH BETTER UH WHITE UH WE WHITE
WIDTH
UH FORMAT YEAH FORMAT
LINE WIDTH
WIDTH
YEAH
IT'S A BIT OFF
WELL
WELL UH LET'S UH TALK ABOUT THAT LATER UH
IT'S SPECIAL PEN
YEAH
NO
I THINK IT SHOULD BE AT THE BUTTON BOTTOM
BOTTOM
THE L. C. D.
YEAH
WELL BUT UH WHAT WHAT IF WE WE FIRST DECIDE THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND THEN LOOK AT THE DESIGN
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DECIDE THIS
YEAH
YES
WELL WE HAVE A POWER BUTTON
GUYS
GUYS
WE HAVE A POWER BUTTON SETTING BUTTONS L. C. D. WINDOW THE NUMBER BUTTONS
UH
YES
UH THE MUTE BUTTON
I H LOVE THAT ONE
YES
YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH
WELL THAT'S THAT'S ALSO DESIGN
YES
UM
WELL H HO
YES
YES
THEY ARE FOR SOME UH VIDEO UH
APART
SO PEOPLE HAVE TO MOVE THEIR HAND
AND THEY GET LESS UH COMPLAINTS OF R. S. I.
THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS DO BECAUSE ALL MY I IMPORTANT BUTTONS ARE THE SAME PLACE
YES
WELL NOT
YES
UH-HUH
UP AND DOWN FAR APART FROM EACH OTHER
WELL NOT TOO MUCH
WELL FOR EXAMPLE THE POWER BUTTON YOU CAN IF SOMEONE IS CONSTANTLY Z ZAPPING
IT'S NOT GOING TO MISS THAT IT THAT THE POWER BUTTON IS NOT RIGHT BESIDE IT
BECAUSE I HAVE SOMEONE BUT THE BUTTONS IS WAY
SO THAT ONE CAN BE PUT AWAY
THE POWER BUTTON CAN UH BE UH UH
YES
OH MAN FIVE MINUTES
YEAH WELL FIVE MINUTES LEFT
YEP
UM HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT WITH THOSE NUMBERS
WELL I HAVE IT HERE
YEAH WELL THAT'S GOING TO TAKE TOO TOO MUCH TIME
YES
YES
WELL THE L. C. D.
UM YOU ARE INDUSTRIAL YOU ARE USER INTERFACE
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO TO MIKE
BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE CONSENSUS WITH
WELL
WELL IT'S A BIT HARD BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE UH INDIVIDUALLY
THAT'S A BIT UH
YES
YES IT IS
WELL WHAT IF WE'RE GOING TO NOW DECIDE ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS AND THE DESIGN COMES INTO THE NEXT ROUND
PLUS THE D TH THE DESIGN ROUND IS STILL TO COME HUH
ALRIGHT THESE FUNCTIONS
THE NUMBER F WELL YES THAT'S ALRIGHT
W THE NUMBER FUNCTION
ARE WE GOING TO UH DO IT LIKE UH ON MIKE'S SCREEN WITH UH ONE BUTTON THAT SAYS I'M GOING TO DO A T TWO NUMBER DIGITAL
HOW DO YOU WANT IT TO DO THEN
IT IT HAS TO R RECOGNISE ONE AS THERE COULD STILL COME MORE
YES
ALRIGHT SO NO BUTTON FOR THAT
OKAY UH ANYONE ANY UH OTH OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES OF OUR UH REMOTE
SO
NO WE'D UH JUST SAID WE DIDN'T UH
WELL UH
UM WELL BECAUSE WE CAN'T INTEGRATE IT WITH ANY OTHER UH REMOTES ALL THOSE BUTTONS ON THOSE PICTURES ARE UH IRRELEVANT
SO JUST FOR A TELEVISION IS THAT ALL WE NEED
TELETEXT IS GONE
SO ALL THOSE BUTTONS THAT AR ARE TO DO WITH TELETEXT OH SCREEN PLACING
WE'LL HAVE UH THOSE UH BUTTONS ABOUT UH
AND UH THE TWO IMPORTANT ONES WE'RE L F FORGETTING
UH THERE'S UM SCREEN
YOU CAN MAKE IT WIDER AND LESS WIDE
AND THE BUTTON THAT YOU CAN GO TO A. V. FOR YOUR VIDEO
THOSE TWO
BUT IT'S JUST TWO AND WE MAKE A CLIP
TH THAT'S A BIT UH WASTE
YES
OR AT THE TOP
YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN IS GOING TO GO
YES
YEAH
WELL I THINK THEY SHOULD IN AN IN AN ISOLATED PART OF THE REMOTE
YES
YES
YES
WELL ANY OTHER UH
GO TO VIDEO THAT'S ALWAYS ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
TO A. V. UH TO A. V. A. V. A. V.
WELL L N NO NOT AT NOT AT MY REMOTE
YEAH
YES
I DON'T
I GO TO NINETY NINE
TH THAT'S THE BUTTON UH NO
NO YOU CAN CH PUSH ZERO
YEAH
YEAH I I THINK THAT ONE BUTTON IS UH I USE IT UH
YEAH
THESE BUTTONS I DON'T HAVE BUTTONS FOR CHANNEL SETTING UH ESPECIALLY ON MY REMOTE
IT'S IT'S INCORPORATED WITH P M PLUS AND DOWN UH THOSE
SO WE STILL HAVE ONE UH FOUR
CH CH
OKAY
OH THE OKAY BUTTON
OH YOU ALWAYS HAVE IN THE CENTRE AN OKAY BUTTON FOR YOUR MENU
MENU BUTTON
CHANNEL SETTING MENU
WE HAVE TO GO
OKAY
SO UM SAVE
YES SEE
YES I HAVE PUT IT IN
HERE
ALRIGHT
GUYS
WE'RE GOING TO UH GO TO OUR UH ROOMS AND UH WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE S THINGS ON OUR OWN I THINK
SO
WELL SEE YOU UH W W WE HAVE LUNCHTIME BY THE WAY NOW UH SO UH
LUNCH
AH
WE DIDN'T EXACTLY DO EVERYTHING BUT SO
MM
OH
OH
OH THAT'S A SHAME
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YEAH
YEAH
NO
I DON'T THINK
YEAH
YES YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND AND AND KNOW HOW IT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK
YEAH BUT NOBODY READS A MANUAL ABOUT A REMOTE CONTROL I THINK
YEAH RIGHT
IT SH IT SHOULD BE THERE THE MANUAL
BUT BUT NOT TO EXPLAIN HOW THE REMOTE WORKS
ONLY
HMM
NO
I THINK THAT'S UH DIFFICULT TO REALISE ALSO
NO AND WE HAVE CUSTOMERS IN MULTIPLE UH COUNTRIES I THINK
YEAH
NO
OH YOU GO
YEAH GO AHEAD
HIGH TECH
YOU CAN ALSO LIKE
YEAH I WAS THINKING YOU CAN
ARE SOME OF THE THE THE UM
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE FOR FOR CHANNEL CHANGING TWO LITTLE BUTTONS ON THE SIDE OF THE REMOTE SO YOU CAN JUST DO LIKE THIS
LIKE SOME UH LITTLE UH GAMEBOY THINGS OR SOME HMM
WELL
YEAH ALRIGHT BUT
YEAH BUT IF YOU S SAY THEM UP AND DOWN THEY THEY'LL UNDERSTAND IT I THINK
EIGHTY PER CENT WOULD
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
YEAH BUT
MM
WELL I THOUGHT UM EVERYBODY ON THE WEBSITE UH WOULD SEE THE SAME THING BUT
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE
YEAH
FOR INSTANCE YOU COULDN'T SEE THIS
UM
YEAH
WELL I'M MIKE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
THE THE METHOD
WELL
I USED MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH REMOTES TOOK A GOOD L LOOK UH AT THE REMOTES ON THE CORPORATE WEBSITE WHICH ARE THESE TWO
UM
YES THESE ARE FROM FROM ANOTHER UH MANUFACTURER
UM
THIS ONE IS ENGINEERING CENTRED SO THIS ONE HAS THE MOST FUNCTIONS AND UM THINGS
THIS ONE IS USER CENTRED
UM
I LIKE USER CENTR CENTRED UH UH ALSO THE BEST
UM
WELL I THOUGHT UH THAT WE UH REDUCE THE THE OPTION TO CONTROL THE D. V. D. ALSO AND TELETEXT AND THAT KIND OF STUFF
UH SO I THOUGHT WE WE WE WOULD USE MORE OR NEED MORE BUTTONS THAN THIS ONE
BUT
YES
TH THAT'S WHY THIS MM IS NOT RELEVANT ANY MORE I FEEL
UM
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS UH WE'LL NEED
I UM I KINDA LIKE THE SHAPE
I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
BUT
NO I'VE WELL I SHOWED IT SOMEWHERE
UM
OH YEAH
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FURTHER WITH THE IDEA OF A REMOVABLE FRONT
SO WE CAN CAN UH YEAH CUSTOMISE THE
MM
YEAH
IT'S A FRONT
IT'S NOT THE THE WHOLE REMOTE THAT CHANGES OF COURSE
YOU CAN
MM
OR YOU CAN YOU CAN CAN PUT THE SAME SYMBOL ON ON EVERY REMOTE
SO L LIKE ERICSSON DOES EVERY UH
S SOMETHING LIKE THIS
IT'S RECOGNISABLE
UM
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE YEAH
YEAH
UM WELL SO UH UH LIKE I SAID I THOUGHT WE'D WE'D USE MORE FUNCTION
IF WE WE HAD TO INCLUDE MORE FUNCTIONS
BUT WE DON'T
SO UM
YEAH
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS WE NEED
MAYBE SOME LESS
LIKE EJECT WE DON'T NEED AND SOME OTHER BUTTONS WE DON'T NEED
I THINK UH
YEAH I WILL
I THINK UH FOR THE REMOTE UM UH LESS IS MORE
THE LESS BUTTONS THE BETTER THE DESIGN
UM
WE SHOULD GO WITH THAT CONCEPT I THINK
I KNOW
MM
YEAH BUT WHAT KIND OF FEATURES
LIKE L. C. D. SCREENS AND VOICE RECOGNITION
BUT I'VE
YEAH THAT'S NICE
YEAH WE SHOULD KEEP THAT SIMPLE TOO
IT WILL
NO IT SHOULD BE UH INTEGRATED
I THINK
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE ON UM SOME RADIOS IN CAR
YOU WHERE IT'S YEAH WALKING TO YEAH
WA YEAH
YEAH WELL WE WE WE STILL NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH THAT WILL COST
OR MAYBE YOU WILL GET THAT INFORMATION UH YEAH
AT THE TOP OR AT THE BOTTOM
YEAH BUT
YEAH BUT WITH WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN ON THE TOP IT GETS A BIT UNNATURAL
'CAUSE MOST REMOTES HAVE SOME SPACE LEFT AT THE BOTTOM
YEAH NO MM
UH WELL BECAUSE MOST UH REMOTES HAVE UM SOME SPACE LEFT AT THE BOTTOM AND THAT WAY YOU CAN KEEP THE SHAPE RECOGNISABLE FOR EVERYBODY
I C
WELL I D I THINK THAT'S THAT'S UGLY BUT
I TH
YEAH
POWER BUTTON ALWAYS YEAH
YEAH
YEAH Y YOU GOTTA ZAP LIKE THIS OR YOU WANT TO YEAH
YEAH YOU DON'T WANT YOU WANT UH YEAH IT IT IT MUST BE A REMOTE
YEAH
AT THE BOTTOM
IN A FEW MINUTES OH YEAH OH YEAH I TOTALLY AGREE
YEAH
HE'S THE BOSS
NO IT'S OUR JOB
FOR ALL OF US I THINK
THE TEN NUMBERS
YEAH
VOLUME
I THINK WE WE SHOULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS UM TO UM
THE THE CHANNEL UP AND CHANNEL DOWN BUTTON
YEAH IN CIRCLE YOU KNOW
AND AND A VOLUME CONTROL ALSO IN IT
YES AS I ALREADY SAID WE COULD DROP SOME OF THESE BUTTONS
YEAH
I THINK THESE SHOULD BE IN ONE BIG CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE
YEAH BUT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THEIR BUTTONS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE
THEY THEY NEED TO BE CENTRED
VOLUME HARDLY
NO I DON'T THINK
YEAH BUT
YEAH BUT NO
THE OTHER THE OTHER TWO UH FRUSTRATIONS ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT
SO
WELL THEY ARE USED FOUR TIMES AN HOUR SO
POWER BU BUTTON SHOULD BE LEFT AT THE TOP
MM
YEAH
WELL CONSENSUS UM WE WE CAN PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE SO
ALRIGHT
NO
WELL JUST WHEN YOU PUSH A ONE ONE AND
NO IF YOU ON MOST T. V. S IF YOU UH PRESS TWO NUMBERS SHORTLY AFTER EACH OTHER D IT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WE WE CAN MAKE MAKE UH A LITTLE ROW OF LIKE FOUR BUTTONS DOWN HERE
OR AT YEAH ALRIGHT THEN
OH THEY CAN BE SMALL OR ROUND LIKE BUTTONS
WHY GO TO VIDEO
THAT'S JUST ZERO
YEAH
YEAH BUT YOU CAN CAN ZAP DOWN
YES I THINK TH
NO THEN YOU PRESS NINETY NINE
I THINK GO TO VIDEO IS
AN IRRELEVANT BUTTON BUT
YEAH WELL Y YOU MUST HAVE
YEAH YOU YEAH YOU HAVE ONE ONE BUTTON FROM S SET FREQUENCY O OR SOMETHING AND THEN WITH PLUS AND MIN MINUS YOU CAN UH ADJUST THE UH
YEAH ALRIGHT
I THINK THINGS LIKE UH CONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS SHOULD BE UM IN THE MENU YEAH
YEAH THE
OR THE VOLUME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOUR PEN
I THOUGHT WE'D UH LUNCH UH RIGHT NOW OR NOT
YEAH LUNCH BREAK
MM
WELL YEAH
NO
OH
WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES FOR THIS UH DISCUSSION
ALRIGHT
HUH
YEAH
MM-HMM NOW IT'S RIGHT
IT'S MEANT TO BE EASILY WIPED OUT YEAH
MM-HMM
I I DISAGREE BUT UH IT'S NOT UH T IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO DISAGREE I GUESS
OH ALRIGHT
YEAH WE ARE A REAL FASHIONABLE COMPANY
I READ UH I READ IT ON THE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT COMPANY WE WERE BUT WE WE DESIGN UH ESPECIALLY TRENDY UH TRENDY TRENDY STUFF
SO IT HAS TO BE UH A MODERN DESIGN
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW UH WHEN YOU DESIGN A THING OF COURSE
YEAH
THE ORDER
NO
YOU CAN ZAP AWAY
YEAH
OH
OH
MM-HMM
I THINK OUR UH USER UH EXPERT SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER MANUAL A MANUAL FOR THE REMOTE OF COURSE
UH
I DIDN'T READ IT
OH ALRIGHT
USERS TO UH ADD ONE
DO YOU THINK
MM-HMM
YEAH ALRIGHT
BECAUSE THEY DON'T USE IT
ALRIGHT
WELL MAYBE FOR THE IF YOU DON'T RECOGNISE A BUTTON WHO D WHO D WHO DO I CALL UH WH WHEN I DON'T KNOW IT
ISN'T IT PART OF THE OF THE U NO
NO
NEVER MIND
CONSIDER THE M
YEAH
MM-HMM
IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE
YEAH
WELL WE'LL UH CONSIDER IT UH
WE'LL THINK ABO WE'LL THINK
NO WE'LL LOOK WE'LL LOOK INTO THAT LATER
ALRIGHT
WE HAVE VERY DEMANDING CLIENTS
YEAH YEAH ALRIGHT
WELL WE'LL CONSIDER BOTH AND AND SEE WHAT UH WHAT WHAT WE CAN FIND I THINK
WE DON'T RULE THEM OUT UH YET
SHALL I GIVE A TECHNICAL TALK
ALRIGHT
WELL UH IT IS MY TASK TO UH EXPLAIN UH OR TO POINT OUT A WORKING DESIGN
WE HAVE THAT HERE
OKAY HOW DO YOU ENLARGE IT SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE F. F. FIVE
YEP
WELL THE WORKING DESIGN THAT'S MY UH
WELL ALRIGHT UH YOU KNOW WHO I AM AND WHAT I DO
SO UH WE HAVE THIS
IT'S A BIT UH UNCLEAR BECAUSE I WANTED TO COPY PASTE SOMETHING
IT WAS ORIGINALLY IN BLACK AND WHITE BUT IT BECAME BLACK AND PURPLE
BUT I THINK YOU CAN READ IT
UM WELL UM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UH FOR YOU TO REALISE THE BASIC FUNCTION OF A REMOTE CONTROL
UH WELL YOU CAN SEE UH
AND I THEN CAN SELECT I CAN SELECT ON THE DINGS IT GOES TO THE NEXT PAGE
WELL YOU CAN READ IT IT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT
MEANWHILE THIS IS A SCHEMATIC UH UM VIEW OF UH HOW A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL WORKS
YOU HAVE UH BASICALLY UH THE ENERGY THE POWER OF THE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL UH AND THE SENDER
W WHICH IS THE LED THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE BULB THAT SENDS THE THE INFRARED BEAM TO THE NO TO THE SET
AND UH THE SOURCE IS OF COURSE THE USER
UH THE USER INTERFACE IS UM UH THE THE THE BUTTONS OF COURSE
AND THE THE USER INTERFACE SENDS UH THE THE DIFFERENT SIGNALS OF THE DIFFERENT BUTTONS TO THE CHIP
AND THE CHIP UH SENDS IT TO THE LED AND THE LED SENDS IT TO THE RECEIVER
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BASIC IDEA
VERY BASIC
UM WELL I HAVE UH UH PUT IT IN A IN IN IN A A COUPLE OF BASIC STEPS
UH THE REMOTE UH IS BASICALLY JUST WAITING FOR A USER TO PRESS A KEY
IT DOES NOTHING UNTIL UH OF COURSE UH THE KEY IS PRESSED
THE KEY A SIGNAL TO A CHIP UH THE CHIP SENSES THE CONNECTION
UH AND RECOGNISE THE KEY
SO WELL YOU UNDERSTAND
THE CHIP UH PRODUCES MORSE CODE UM A SPECIFIC CODE TO INDICATE THAT SPECIFIC BUTTON THAT IS PRESSED OF COURSE
AND IT USES TRANSISTORS IN THE IN THE REMOTE CONTROL TO AMPLIFY AND TO SEND UH THAT SIGNAL AGAIN TO THE TO THE LED
WHICH IS THE BULB OF COURSE
NOW THE LED PRODUCES AN INFRARED BEAM AND SIGNALS THE WELL IT'S UH VERY SIMPLE AND SIGNALS THE UH SIGNALS TO THE SENSOR ON THE T. V. SET
AND THE T. V. SET UH ALSO RECOGNISES THE THE THE SIGNAL AND PERFORMS THE ASSIGNED TASK
AH BU YEAH BUT WE DON'T
UH WE NO NO BUT YEAH
EXACTLY
UH WELL THIS IS UH THE BASIC UH FUNCTION OF A REMOTE
I'VE SOME COUPLE OF PICTURES HERE
IT'S A VERY BASIC ONE
AND UH IF WE IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD AN UH AN UH L. C. D. SCREEN TO IT IT UH WON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT
THIS IS VERY BASIC UH BASICALLY THE THE SHAPE OF UM OF A REMOTE CONTROL
IT HAS UH VERY LITTLE BUTTONS AND BUT IT IT UH IT'S IT'S QUITE UM YEAH YOU CAN EASILY RECOGNISE THE BUTTONS
THEY'RE UH FAR ENOUGH APART AND AN ANYTHING
IT'S NOT VERY UM
UH NOT VERY HIGH TECH UH INDEED AND IT'S NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY
UH IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHAPE IT'S UH JUST A SIMPLE LONG BOX UH SHAPE
SO WE HAVE TO UH CHANGE A LITTLE BIT UH TO THAT UH SO THAT UH IT BECOMES MORE USER FRIENDLY
AND THAT UH PROBLEMS LIKE UH R. S. I. AND UH THOSE KINDS OF THING DON'T DON'T OC DON'T OCCUR
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH BECAUSE THEY ARE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS AND YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AND AND SEARCH FOR THEM
WELL YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY UH EVERY BUTTON UNDER THE THUMB OF COURSE
YEAH
WELL
BUT IN E IN ANY CASE THE THE BASIC FUNCTION SHOULD BE UH INDEED AND AS YOU SAY AT THE THUMB
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND UH AND THAT THE LESS IMPORTANT UH BUTTONS LIKE THE THE THE DIFFERENT CHANNELS
UH THE NUMBERS ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE AS WELL SHOULD BE UH YEAH WELL NOT IN REACH BECAUSE UH THEY DON'T USE IT UH ALL THE TIME
WELL IT'S UH PRETTY PRETTY BASICALLY UH AS YOU SAID
AND I HAVE SOME PICTURES OF THE INSIDE WORKINGS BUT UH I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO TECHNICAL BECAUSE UH THAT'S NOT UH VERY UH USEFUL FOR YOU
SO YEAH EXACTLY THIS IS UH HOW IT UH LOOKS FROM THE INSIDE
AND UH WELL THAT'S ABOUT IT I THINK
OH YEAH I STILL HAVE THIS
OH I HAD TO DELETE THIS BUT I HAD TO MAKE A SCHEMATIC UH OF THE OF THE NEW BUT I HAD TOO TOO LITTLE TIME
BUT UH DON'T UH
DON'T LOOK AT IT PLEASE
I I THINK IT'S IT'S CLEAR UH HOW IT WORKS
ALRIGHT
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
ALRIGHT
UH
RIGHT
YEAH UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT UH WE HAVE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT HOME PAGES WITH DIFFERENT LINKS
YEAH
MM-HMM
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE UH THE DIFFER FROM DIFFERENT SIDES
BUT I THINK UH
UH YOU CAN DRAW IT IF YOU YEAH
WE CAN PUT IT ON THE ON THE BACK SIDE
YEAH SO THAT YOU DON'T REPLACE THE SYMBOL YEAH
MM-HMM
MIKE UH CAN YOU PUT UH THAT PICTURE FROM ME ON THE IN THE WORD DOCUMENTS FILE
IN MAP
THE YOUNGER UH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I THINK UH THE MOST FUNCTIONS UH UNDERNEATH THAT UH UH NO UM MM USUALLY
BUT
YEAH I THINK M MOST
MOST UH
MM-HMM
UH
YEAH
OUR COMPETITOR
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
SO IT IT JUST SIGNALS THE THE DIFFERENT UH SIG UH THE DIFFERENT SYMBOLS ON THE SCREEN YOU HAVE
UH BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE TO S CHANNEL TWO YOU HAVE TWO ON THE SCREEN AND TWO ON YOUR ON YOUR UM ON YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN
BUT SHOULD IT UH REALLY BE UH CLICKABLE UH OR OR JUST INTEGRATE INSIDE TO TRY TO MAKE IT D MORE TRENDY
BUT THAT'S OF COURSE UH A BIT MORE UH EXPENSIVE THAN UH THE BASIC UH CALCULATOR DESIGN WITH THE SCROLLING TEXT AND THAT KIND OF THING
ALRIGHT
SHOULDN'T WE START WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS
THE L. C. D. SCREEN ALRIGHT BUT WE SHOULD START WITH THE POWER BUTTON
UH
HUH
AND THEN UH
MAYBE WE SHOULD UH CENTRALISE THE DISCUSSION HERE
I DUNNO WHAT UH YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT
WE ARE BUSY WITH SOMETHING
UH-HUH
WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S BETTER AT THE BOTTOM
BUT YOU JUST CAN PUT UH THE THE THE THE THE WHOLE INTERFACE A BIT DOWN SO THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR THE FOR THE INTERFACE
UH-HUH
AND AND WE CAN
BOTTOM
WELL THAT'S A BIT EXAGGERATED
WELL I AGREE WITH YOU
IT'S IT'S ALSO MORE RECOGNISABLE
IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A CALCULATOR TO PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE THE L THE THE
THE THING ON TOP
YEAH W WELL BUT UH YOU DON'T HAVE TO THROW UH UM IMPORTANT ASPE IMPORTANT ASPECT LIKE FAMILIARITY UH COMPLETELY AWAY UH BECAUSE I THINK IT'S UH
I THINK IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO HAVE IT AT THE TOP BECAUSE IT'S UH
IT'S MORE FAMILIAR THAT WAY
A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ANOTHER PEN
MAYBE THAT'S UH BETTER
YOU E YOU ONLY HAVE ONE PEN FOR THAT SCREEN
YEAH
YEAH
I I AGREE
WELL I'M THE I I'M THE DESIGNER SO UM
YEAH
UH WE UH WE WERE BUSY WITH THAT
UH YEAH WE SHOULD UH SUMMON THE THE DIFFERENT UH ASPECTS OF THE THING
SO WE HAVE THE POWER BUTTON
YEAH OF COURSE
UH IT'S UH
YEAH
W WH
WHILE YOU HAVE TO AGREE I CAN SAY IT'S LIKE THIS AND YOU MUST AGREE
YEAH
CHANNEL YEAH
VOLUME CONTROL
UM
WELL LET'S LOOK AT YOUR UH DESIGN
UH
UH-HUH
YEAH
BUT TH TH ON THIS REMOTE TH THESE CONTROLS ARE FOR SOMETHING ELSE A D. V. D. PLAYER OR SOMETHING
SO
YEAH IT'S IT'S ALSO NOT GOOD TO COMPLETELY STAY IN ONE POSITION CONSTANTLY WITH ONE HAND
Y YEAH
IT'S GOOD TO MOVE UH FROM TIME TO TIME
YEAH
NO BUT NOW Y W WOULD WE HAVE TO CHOOSE A
WAY IN MIDDLE
MM-HMM
OH
FAR APART
I THINK YOU CAN HAVE THE TWO BUTTONS OF UP AND DOWN CLOSE TOGETHER
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE UH HAVE TO HAVE VOLUME CONTROL AND AND ZAPPING BUTTON CLOSE TOGETHER
YEAH
C C CAN YOU MAKE YOU MAKE WE CAN USE UH THE DRAWING BOARD NOW I THINK
UH IT IT DOESN'T WORK WELL BUT BUT IT IT WOULD BE PRETTY PRETTY UH NICE IF WE COULD JUST DRAW A SIMPLE THING
MM
ALRIGHT
WELL UH YEAH I I STILL THINK IT'S IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THOUGH TO UH TO HAVE IT AT THE TOP SO YEAH
YOU SAY FAMILIARITY ISN'T IMPORTANT BUT
YEAH D
YEAH
AS WE WE WE WE AGREED WE DO HAVE A L. C. D.
SO THAT'S
THAT'S ENOUGH
YEAH
THERE'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE ZERO
OH LIKE THAT
UM
THEY'D RECOGNISE IT
TH THAT'S THE MOST THAT THAT'S VERY EASY
YEAH
I THINK THESE ARE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
BASIC FUNCTION
OH YEAH
UH JUST TWO JUST TWO UNDER UH UNDER UH
I I THINK UH
BUT YOU YOU CAN PUT UH TWO OR THREE BUTTONS UNDER UH ANOTHER SECTION
UH THAT'S THAT'S TOO COMPLICATED
YOU CAN JUST PUT IT SOMEWHERE THEY THEY AREN'T USED MUCH NOT AS MUCH AS THOSE OTHER SO YOU CAN PUT IT SOMEWHERE
YEAH S BIT SMALLER AND S WELL UH AND AND I THINK MORE AT THE BOTTOM
YEAH
YEAH OR AT THE TOP YEAH
WHAT DO YOU THINK UH THOSE THOSE BUTTONS
ABOVE OR DOWN
AND W WHERE
WELL WE DESIGN IT LATER
WE HAVE IT AND WE DESIGN LATER WHERE EVERYTHING GOES
YEAH
THE THE VIDEO CHANNEL UH
NO NO NOT ALWAYS
ZE YEAH ZERO IS A DIFFERENT CHANNEL THAN UH THE THE VIDEO CHANNEL
BUT IT'S EASY TO GO IF YOU ARE AT UH AT CHANNEL UH FIFTY FIVE AND YOU WANT TO UH GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE VIDEO CHANNEL
YOU DO YOU HAVE TO PUSH A TO TO GET BELOW ZERO
IT'S MORE EASY TO GET TO UH WHERE THE SPECIFIC UH VIDEO CHANNEL BUTTON
YEAH WELL UH D DIFFERENT SCREEN SETTINGS A YEAH SK YEAH Y YOU YOU YOU YOU HAVE SCREEN WIDTH
YEAH TO UH OH YEAH OF COURSE TO CONFIGURE THE PROGRAMME THE YEAH
YEAH
YOU SHOULD YEAH
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT
UH AND AND THE SETTINGS TO CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS THE SETTINGS TO CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS AND THE CONTRAST
CHANNEL YEAH
CHIEF
CHIEF
TH THE MENU MENU BUTTON IS ALSO IMPORTANT
THEN YOU CAN UH
WHERE
I DON'T SEE IT
OH MENU ALRIGHT
IN THE MENU
AND YOU CAN UH THEN ADJUST IT WITH THE ZAPPING BUTTONS OR SOMETHING
BECAUSE UH THE ZAPPING BUTTONS AREN'T USED THEN IF YOU ARE IN THE MENU
YEAH
OR THE VOLUME YEAH
YES CHIEF
YEAH THIS IS THIS IS YOUR THING
I AM HUNGRY
SEE YOU LATER MATE
GREAT MAN
WHO STARTS
ALRIGHT GREAT
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
YES
'KAY
YEAH
NO
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
ALRIGHT
'KAY
ALRIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
ALRIGHT
YEAH
BUT LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT
IT'S JUST TIME CONSUMING SO WE UH HAVE TO GO ON
YES
MM
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
I THINK I HAVE TO START
OH NO NO PROBLEM
I I JUST HAVE TO UH TO THINK WHICH FILE'S MINE 'CAUSE I WAS UH BIT IN A HURRY
I THINK IT'S THIS ONE
BUT I'M NOT SURE
HMM
YEAH
S
RIGHT
YES
THIS IS IT
WELL I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
UM TO START WITH THESE POINTS
UH NEXT SHEET
UM AT FIRST I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE DISLIKE ABOUT THE CURRENT UH CONTROLS BECAUSE IT'S UH A SMART THING TO EXCLUDE THOSE THINGS
UH FURTHERMORE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHAT THEY DO LIKE AND WHAT THEY DO USE
UM THEN I TELL SOMETHING ABOUT UM THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES
SO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THOSE THREE THING THREE THINGS
AND IN THE END I'LL UM SHOW YOU OUR TARGET AUDIENCE OR OUR TARGET PRODUCT USERS CUSTOMERS
WELL UM THE FIRST FINDINGS ARE THAT PEOPLE UM
THINK MOST CONTROLS ARE VERY KIND OF UG UGLY
THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE CURRENT USERS
THEY DON'T LIKE IT SO WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT FRONTS IN THAT SECTION
UM
THEY ALSO SAY THAT'S ABOUT UH I THOUGHT IT WAS FIFTY PER CENT UH THAT MORE MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON UH BETTER LOOKING CONTROLS
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DESIGN A A NICE LOOKING CONTROL
UM THE CURRENT USER USES HIS MACHINE JUST ABOUT
WELL ALL OF THE TIME FOR A FEW FUNCTIONS
UH ALMOST EVERY USER USES IT D THE THE CONTROL FOR JUST TEN PER CENT OF ITS CAPACITY
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE THE BUTTONS FOR THE COMMON UH TASKS KIND OF BIG OR KIND OF UH FLASHY
FURTHERMORE IT'S UH SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE USERS UH ZAPS A LOT
THUS IT MIGHT BE UH MIGHT BE SMART TO MAKE A A BIG UH ZAPPING BUTTON OR SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE SO YOU CAN REACH IT WITH YOUR THUMB
YEAH YEAH RIGHT
RIGHT
A LOT OF LOSERS UM USERS LOSE THEIR CONTROLS IN THEIR IN THEIR LIVING ROOM
SO IT MIGHT BE SENSIBLE TO MAKE SOME KIND OF A BUTTON ON YOUR TELEVISION
THAT'S YOUR UM YOUR CONTROL BEEPS OR SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN FIND THIS VERY EASILY
I DUNNO MAYBE THAT'S AN IDEA
'CAUSE IT'S UH A BIG I THINK FIFTY PER CENT OF THE USERS LOSES HIS ITS CONTROL WITHIN THE SAME ROOM
SO
YEAH BUT WHAT IF YOU LOSE YOUR CLICK ON DEVICE
YEAH BUT IF SOMEONE D SOMEBODY ELSE USES IT IN ANO OTHER ROOM OR SOMETHING
NEE BUT IT IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS IT'S UH THE THE CONTROL IS LOST IN THE SAME ROOM
SO
WELL A BEEPING DEVICE WOULD BE UH FURTHERMORE THE LEARNING TIME IS A PROBLEM
UH THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR PER CENT UM THINKS IT'S IT'S TOO UH TOO DIFFICULT TO LEARN
SO THE THE LEARNING CURVE SHOULD BE VERY SHORT UH FOR THE DUMBEST PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT
YEAH BUT PEOPLE DON'T READ MANUALS
NO
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT MORE TIME IN THE IN THE DESIGN OF UH PICK UP AND USE THAN A MANUAL
YEAH
RIGHT
AND IT SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH CONSISTENT WITH OLDER REMOTES
ALRIGHT
AND WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
SO IT'S BETTER TO UH PUT OUR ATTENTION TO THE THE DESIGN
SO YOU CAN PICK UP AND USE IT THAN I THINK
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT
NEXT POINT
UM R. S. I.
WELL THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT I THOUGHT
BUT UH THE DESIGNER SHOULD UH TAKE IT UH SHOULD UH WIE ZEG IK DAT
YEAH CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF USING YOUR REMOTE
IT SHOULD BE A GOOD IN YOUR HAND
RIGHT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
UM WE'RE LIKE THE REQUIREMENTS SAID WE'RE GONNA SPECIFY OF WE'RE GONNA TARGET A YOUNGER AUDIENCE
UM THAT'S ABOUT SIXTY PER CENT OF THE MARKET SO IT'S UH QUITE IMPORTANT
UM RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE L. C. D. SCREEN ON THEIR ON THEIR UH ZAPPING UH DEVICE
UH
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE AGE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY NINETY NINE PER CENT OF UH THE PEOPLE LIKE THAT
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE THAT IN OUR UH DESIGNS
YEAH BUT THEY THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
SO IF WE WANT TO S IF WE HAVE A BIG
IF WE MAKE LOTS OF UH OF THE STUFF MAYBE WE CAN UH BUY IT VERY CHEAP I DUNNO
WE HAVE TO UH
YEAH I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT
SO
RIGHT
AND UH ANOTHER THING IS UH SPEECH UH RECOGNITION
THEY ALSO LIKE THAT BUT RESEARCH IS VERY UH COSTLY
SO
YEAH BUT
IT IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR THE SALE
WELL I DO THINK L. C. D. IS MORE REACHABLE THAN THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO WE MIGHT CONSIDER L. C. D. SCREENS
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
UM I THINK THAT'S IT
UM
I THINK
IT IS SENSIBLE
TO U UH TO TAKE THIS TAKE THESE POINTS INTO THE NOTES
SO YOU CAN RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
NEXT BUTTON
OH RIGHT
PURPLE
YEAH YEAH YEAH
A BIT
MAYBE YOU CAN SELECT IT
SO IT UH INVERTS
THE P THE WHOLE PICTURE
NAH UH NEVER MIND
YEAH
ALRIGHT
RIGHT
CAN I SAY SOMETHING
UM I HAVE A TABLE HERE ABOUT UH THE L THE RELEVANCE OF THE BUTTONS
UH THE POWER BUTTON IS USED VERY MUCH CHANNEL SELECTION VOLUME AND TELETEXT
WELL TELETEXT IS NOT AN OPTION SO THAT UH BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE UM THE POWER
CHANNEL AND VOLUME BUTTONS UH NEAR TO THE THUMB SO YOU CAN'T HAVE R. S. I. UH CONSEQUENCES
RIGHT
MAKE THEM BIG MAKE THEM EASY TO UH TO PRESS
RIGHT
YEAH RIGHT
RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT
WE
BUT
YEAH
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
AND
BUT IS THAT IS THAT USEABLE
DO PEOPLE UH WHEN THEY PICK UP A REMOTE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THAT
IT'S A F IT'S A NEW FEATURE YOU CAN MAKE MAKE A DOUBLE FEATURE L LIKE A BUTTON ON THE TOP AND UNDER IT
YEAH HE FEELS IT IMMEDIATELY
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT CONTINUE
SORRY
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
YEAH IT'S CLEAR
I DUNNO
I THINK UH W
ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AGO
LOSING TIME LOSING TIME
YEAH RIGHT
SO
I DON'T THINK SO
YEAH RIGHT
THESE ARE ALREADY IN USE
ALRIGHT OKAY
WELL YEAH ME TOO
MM
BUT WE HAVE TO REJECT THAT BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENTS
ALRIGHT
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH
BUT IT
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YEAH THAT'S A MUST
WE MUST HAVE THAT
WE CAN MAKE A SYMBOL OF THE COMPANY RIGHT HERE
AND IF YOU PUT A FRONT ON IT THERE'S A HOLE ON THE FRONT
SO THE SYMBOL'S ALWAYS ON YEAH
YEAH YEAH
BUT LET'S NOT FOCUS ON THE FRONT
ALRIGHT
YEAH I AGREE
I'VE I'VE GOT ANOTHER POINT
UM THERE ARE TWO TARGET AUDI AUDIENCES AND WE'VE UH CHOSE FOR THE YOUNGER ONE
UM RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT UM IT'S A HIGH INTERESTED UH IN FEATURES
THEY ARE HIGH HIGH INTERESTED IN FEATURE
BUT THEY ARE MORE CRITICAL
FO YEAH CRITICAL
SO THE YOUNGER AUDIENCE
SO WE MUST UM MUST DESIGN UH A CONTROL THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE PEOPLE
MM-HMM
CLIP AREN'T USED MUCH
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH BUT YEAH
HERE LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS
THE NEWEST FEATURES ARE LIKE I SAID ARE UH L. C. D. AND UH SPEECH UH CONTROL
OUR AUDIENCE THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY LIKE THESE UH FEATURES
YOU SEE
SO WE MUST BUILD IN SOMETHING OR THEY WILL TO UH GO TO THE CONCURRENT
THE CONCURRENT
COMPETITORS RIGHT
SO I DO THINK WE HAVE TO UH HAVE SOME FEATURES
EVEN THOUGH THEY COST A LITTLE MORE
RIGHT
RIGHT
LIKE A TICKER TAPE
WHICH PROGRAMME YOU ARE L WATCHING OR SOMETHING
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH RIGHT
NO NOT CLICKABLE
NAH NO NO NO
YEAH JUST AT AT THE TOP
SO WHEN YOU S YOU SIT LIKE THIS YOU CAN CAN WATCH
I THINK IT SHOULD BE AT THE TOP
YEAH RIGHT
IT'S A TICKER TAPE IDEA
WELL IT'S JUST ONE SCRIPT
YEAH FIVE MINUTES OF JA JA FOR PROGRAMMING
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE
ALRIGHT WE GO WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN
'KAY
RIGHT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN FIND THAT BUT
NEXT TIME
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
WE SHOULD HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF HOW IT'S GONNA LOOK
RIGHT
AT THE TOP
I THINK THE TOP IS MORE UH
WHEN YOU S HOW DO YOU ZAP
YOU JUST SIT IN YOUR CHAIR
WITH THE REMOTE
YEAH BUT THAT'S WHERE YOUR HAND BALL MIGHT BE
YEAH I DUNNO
WE'LL DRAW TWO AND THEN WE'LL SEE UH
NO UM HE THINKS YEAH RIGHT
HE THINKS IT'S BETTER TO PUT THE L. C. D. AT THE BOTTOM AND I THINK IT'S BETTER AT THE TOP
BUT YOUR
YEAH
THE THE TICKER THE L. C. D. IS LIKE LIKE SMALL
IT'S IT'S WIDE
IT'S NOT NOT HIGH
BUT
YEAH RIGHT
BUT
WE'RE MAKING A REMOTE WITH WITH A FEW FUNCTIONS YOU KNOW
WE
HIGH TECH
WIDTH
TH THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
WHEN I DRAW HERE IT OH
HUH
YEAH IT'S OFF
IT IT NEEDS TO BE CALIBRATED AGAIN
WELL
WHERE
ALRIGHT WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
UM
I THINK WE HAVE UH A FEW FUNCTIONS AND WE CAN PUT UH THE L. C. D. ABOVE IT
AND STILL HAVE LOTS OF ROOM AT THE BOTTOM WHERE YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND
AT THE BOT
SO
WE ARE TWO UH V. S. TWO
RIGHT
GREAT
AND MOREOVER I THINK THAT YOU TWO SHOULD BE UH COME TO CONSENSUS ABOUT THE L. C. D. S
IT'S UH YOUR IT'S YOUR JOB
YEAH RIGHT
ALRIGHT LET'S KEEP IT CENTRAL
MM
RIGHT
YOU SHOULD PUT THAT UH POWER BUTTON CHANNEL AND VOLUME SHOULD HAVE THE MOST UH IMPORTANCE
YEAH BUT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT R. S. I.
WAS T KINDA TRUE
WHEN WHEN YOU UH PUT THEM ALL IN THE SAME PLACE
THE MOST USED BUTTONS YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S JUST WHAT R. S. I. 'S ALL ABOUT
SO IT MIGHT BE SMARTER TO PUT THEM A LITTLE MORE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
UM
FREQUENCY OF UH BUTTON USE
UM CHANNELS ARE UH MOST UH IS MOST USED WITHIN THE HOUR
YOU CAN SEE
SO THE THE CHANNEL UH CHANNEL BUTTONS SHOULD BE FAR FAR APART I THINK UP AND DOWN
YOU THINKING UH ABOUT R. S. I.
Y LOOK AT UH LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY
NEI NOT TOO MUCH BUT
NEI NEI NEI N I I TOTALLY AGREE
BUT JUST
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
I AGREE
AND SHOULD AND SHOULD BE RED
RIGHT JUST MAKE SOME DECISIONS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE HAVE TO UH
I DO THINK YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT CENTRAL NOW
JUST UH YOU DECIDE THAT YOU DECIDE THAT AND READY
YEAH
NEI
WE'RE NO WE'RE DECIDING NOW SO
TOP OR BOTTOM
OKAY
YEAH RIGHT
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
NO
DO YOU STILL HAVE THE PICTURES OVER THERE
YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT
YOU DO NEED THE UH MULTI OR DID UH NO LIKE THIS ONE
YOU DO NEED THEM
YEAH I KNOW
BUT ARE WE
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT UH NOW OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH IT'S MOST USEABLE THIS WAY
YEAH
RIGHT
I DO THINK WE HAVE TO PUT THAT UNDERNEATH A CLIP
YEAH
OKAY RIGHT
WELL IF YOU YOU TAKE THOSE TH IF YOU
YEAH BUT YOU CAN Z YOU CAN ZAP T YOU CAN YOU CAN ZAP TO THE VIDEO CHANNEL FROM ZERO TO UH
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU ZAP DOWN ZERO YOU GET TO A. V.
AH UH WELL WHATEVER
YEAH BUT IF WE'RE CHOOSING TO UH INCORPORATE THESE BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO HAVE UH CHANNEL SETTING IF YOU WA IF YOU HAVE A NEW T. V.
YOU HAVE TO SET THE CHANNELS
RIGHT ALL TH THESE UH DIFFERENT BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO
AH I DO
RIGHT
THAT'S THE ONLY ONE WE PUT UH IN THERE
FOR A SCREEN UH FU UH CHANNEL SETTING
PROGRAMME RIGHT
UH
AH
GREAT
ALRIGHT
AH
OKAY
GET INTO MY BELLY
OKAY
UH DOOR IS CLOSED
WELL LET'S BEGIN
BECAUSE IF WE HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS THE LAST UH MEETING WE'LL HAVE TO HURRY UP
UM WELL I'LL START WITH THE PRESENTATION AGAIN THE AGENDA
YO
SO
UH THIS ONE I THINK
UH YEAH
WELL ALRIGHT
UM WELL I'LL SHOW YOU THE NOTES
IT'S NOT AS UH INTERESTING AS IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE WE JUST UH HAD THE MEETING BUT I'LL SHOW THEM
WE'LL GET YOUR PRESENTATIONS AGAIN ON THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
UM
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO DEC DECIDE ABOUT THE CONTROL THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPTS
I'VE PUT A F UH A FILE IN THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT FOLDER WHICH SAYS EXACTLY UH WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS WE SHOULD TAKE
SO THIS TIME WE EXACTLY KNOW WHAT TO DECIDE ABOUT
AND THEN WE'LL CLOSE AGAIN
UH
WELL THESE ARE SOME EXAMPLES BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THEM LATER
WE'LL FIRST LOOK AT YOUR UH PRESENTATIONS
ALRIGHT
WALTER WILL UH START AGAIN THIS TIME
YO
'KAY
'KAY
LESS
WELL YEAH
L. C. D. AND OUR UH OUR FRONTS
WELL EASY TO USE UH S IS A BIT UH CONTRADICTIONARY WITH THE FIRST UH FUNCTIONAL IS NOT AN ISSUE AND THEN EASY TO USE
WELL WE HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE OF THEM
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
WE'LL WE'LL LOOK AT UH
'KAY
SO
WELL
YEAH WELL
YEAH
B
WELL THE THE HANDY THING ABOUT OUR FRONTS IS THAT WE CAN FOLLOW THESE TRENDS E EV EVERY YEAR
TH THIS YEAR IT'S FRUITS BUT NEXT YEAR IT'S IT'S SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT
YES
YEP ALRIGHT
WOOD IS POPULAR
AHA
YEAH YEAH YEAH
ALRIGHT
NICE UH WELL SHOW US
WELL MAYBE IT IT IT IS BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK STRONG
SO MAYBE
BUT WE STILL HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR PRICE OF COURSE
BECAUSE UH IF WE WANT AN L. C. D. UH WINDOW ETCETERA UH
YEAH
YES
SPORTS UH THEY'RE UH THAT UH ARE ACCESSIBLE ON ON YOUR L. C. D. UH WINDOW UH-HUH
THAT'S NICE
ALL THE RESULTS
YEAH
YEAH
MM-HMM
NAI
UH NO
IT'S T TERRIBLE
ALRIGHT
HMM
YEAH ALRIGHT
YEAH
AND IT'S ROUND
WELL YOU CAN MAKE TH TH TH THAT MIDDLE RING CAN YOU YOU CAN MAKE ANOTHER COLOUR
SO UH THOSE KIND OF THINGS YOU CAN YOU CAN COMBINE
NO IT ISN'T
OKAY
YES
SO IF YOU TI
WELL
YOU YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE UH SOME SOME COLOURED TITANIUM OR SOMETHING
SO IT IT LOOKS PRETTY BUT IT FEELS STRONG
NO TITANIUM
WHAT DO YOU EXACTLY MEAN WITH DOUBLE CURVED
DOUBLE CURVED
IT IT MEAN YEAH WELL OKAY
WELL
THIS SOFT MATERIAL THING FROM UH YEAH
ALRIGHT
OKAY
WE WILL TAKE THAT
AND THEN UH MIKE
OKAY
OH
THAT'S INTERESTING
OKAY
BUT YOU CAN ALSO SAY THAT WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING IT DOES SOME FUNCTION
OH
THAT'S A BIT UH
YES
I UNDERSTAND
BUT IT HAS NO FUNCTIONALITY FOR OUR REMOTE AT ALL
HMM
SO YOU PUT A MENU IN THE L. C. D.
AH
BUT THEN WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE AN UH AN OKAY BUTTON
JUST UH THERE IS ALREADY A BLANK
YES
SO YEAH
NO M NEXT YEAR THAT'S OUT
YEAH
YEAH
YES
AND WHAT'S THE MENU BUTTON
BUT HOW DID HOW DO YOU GET OUT OF THE MENU THEN

OR YOU CAN PUT IN THE L. C. D. 'S UH WINDOW AN OPTION GET OUT
EXIT
WELL IT'S JUST A CHOICE
HUH
YEAH
OKAY
WELL OKAY ALRIGHT
UM THEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE DECISIONS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
I'D I AGREE
FINE
YEAH
YES
TOO BIG
THEY'RE ALL BLACK
HEY THAT ONE I LIKE
NO
THE REMOTE
TERRIBLE
IT'S IT'S ALL TOO MUCH BUTTONS

WELL THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE I THINK
ALRIGHT
YEAH
OKAY
HUH
MM NO
'KAY
NO NOT VERY STRANGE
IT STILL HAS T
YES
TH A A KIND OF BRIDGE
SO IT F FALLS OVER THE HAND
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I HAVE AT HOME A REMOTE WITH A BRIDGE
IT'S JUST A HALF ROUND HALF HALF CIRCLE AT AND THEN IT FALLS EXACTLY OVER THE HAND AND THAT'S VERY NICE
THAT'S IT FEELS COMFORTABLE
YEAH
YEAH ALRIGHT
UM WHERE DID I PUT IT
UM CONCEPTUAL PHASE I THINK THIS IS IT
I GOT THIS FROM OUR FRIENDS
SO UH YEAH THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
THESE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES WHICH WE HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT
ALL THE THE MATERIALS FROM THE CASE UH THE ELECTRIC CABLE THAT'S ALL YOUR UH YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY
UM
YEAH
UM NOW FROM THE USER INTERFACE YOUR UH PACKAGE
UM WHERE NO WELL THAT'S MORE LIKE THE BUTTONS WHERE THEY HAVE TO COME
AND UM
B A BIT OF YEAH WELL A BIT OF UH DESIGN
YES BUT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THESE NOW
AND UH THE TREND WATCHING
SO AS YOU SAID FRUITY IS IN WELL SELLS GOOD
WOW
UH THESE THINGS
UH YES
UM SO IF WE UH GO THROUGH THEM
YEAH WELL UH
WHY SHOULD I UH
YEAH
SO
WHAT WHAT KIND OF PROPERTIES SHOULD IT HAVE
WELL WE JUST LISTENED
YOU KNOW WHAT
ALRIGHT
I'VE UH
TITANIUM BACK PLASTIC FRONT
OKAY
UM WELL I AM GOING TO PUT IT IN HERE UH BECAUSE WE CAN UH LOOK
I UM SOLID FEEL AND TRENDY LOOK
SO MATERIAL UM HARD PLASTIC FOR THE FRONT
OKAY
AND WELL THE THE ELECTRICAL CABLE IS JUST NORMAL UH
IT'S UH FROM UH OUR COFFEE UH
OF COURSE
WELL UH ALL THE ALL THE INSIDE WORK OF OUR REMOTE IS UH STANDARD
WORK
SO
THE CHIP IS NORMAL SILICON
UH THE BUTTONS ARE NORMAL ETCETERA
OKAY
SO THAT'S JUST EASY
UH WE DECIDE ABOUT THAT JUST BY LOOKING AT OUR COMPETITORS AND OUR EARLIER UH REMOTES
THE CONCEPTUAL SPECIFICATION OF THE USER INTERFACE
UM WELL WE HAVE OUR BEAUTIFUL DRAWING
WELL YOU CAN PUT THAT IN UH INTO THE SHARED FOLDER AND THEN I'LL PUT IT IN OUR END REPORT
YES YOU CAN
MM YEAH
YOU CAN UH PUT SOME UH WHICH BUTTON IS WHAT
OKAY
UM THE TREND WATCHING
INCLUDED THESE DAYS
AND WHAT DO WE
WE THING THAT FRUIT AND BRIGHT COLOURS ARE
YES
WE CAN ALSO UH IMPLEMENT UM WE CAN ALSO IMPLEMENT FRONTS FROM UM MOVIES THAT ARE VERY HOT
UH THOSE KIND OF THINGS
YEAH
LAUNCH DIFFERENT LINES AT ONCE
WE SHOULD NOT GIVE THEM THE M THE MOST LOVELY FRONT
WHEN THEY BUY IT FOR THE FIRST TIME
YEAH
COME ON
WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE THOSE FIFTY MILLION YEAH
THE MOST UGLY

BUT I THINK SO
TH THEY'RE SAYING SMARTBOARD AND THAT'S IT
THIS IS THE SMARTBOARD SO
UM SO YOU CAN UH YOU YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A PROTOTYPE AND Y WELL THAT'S INCLUDES UH SPECIFYING THE BUTTONS ETCETERA
YEAH
SO YOU'LL GET IT ON YOUR EM ON YOUR LAPTOP
UM WELL YOU WILL GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE UH ON THE PROJECT YEAH PROJECT EVALUATION

YEP
YEAH
WHAT
SO ROUND WHERE

OH WE HAVE A ONE
SO YOU CAN UH DRAW A YEAH

NO I THINK UH WELL YOU'LL MAYBE YOU CAN UH KEEP YOUR UH LAPTOP HERE
OR GET YOUR MOUSE
BECAUSE IT'S LITTLE BIT UH HARD TO WORK WITH THESE UH PLATES
I ALWAYS HAVE A MOUSE NEXT TO MY LAPTOP
I HATE THESE
UGH
AND IN YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE PUT A TOUCH PAD ON IT AND SAY HA HA
YEAH
WE KNOW YOU'LL YOU'LL YOU'LL HATE IT BUT
BUT THEY DO WANT SOME GADGETS
SO THAT'S WHA WHAT WE'RE DOING
WELL WE WON'T

ONLY THE FEEL
OH
YEAH
YEAH
THE BUTTONS CAN BE MADE OF AN UH A SOFT MATERIAL
BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE THAT
YEAH
RIGHT
YEAH
YEAH
WELL UM NAH THE METHOD UM WE WILL UM INCLUDE THE BUTTONS AS WE DISCUSSED UH EARLIER
UM AN L. C. D. S SCREEN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED
UM WE MUST DECIDE WHERE THIS MEETING
UM THERE ARE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN SPEECH RECOGNITION UM SYSTEMS UM AND THEY ARE ALREADY BEING UH USED ON UH COFFEE MACHINES
AND UM WELL THEY'RE CHEAP SO WE COULD USE THEM NOW
UM IT'S NOT REALLY SPEECH RECOGNITION IT'S MORE UM LIKE YOU CAN UM TALK TO THE CHIP
UH RECORD THE MESSAGE AND RECORD AN ANSWER AND THEN ONCE YOU UH TALK TO THE REMOTE THEN UM HE WILL A ANSWER WITH THE
THE PRERECORDED MESSAGE THAT YOU LEFT
SO IF I SAY HI MIKE AND YOU HAVE RECORDED UH HI MIKE BACK THEN YOU WILL GET THAT
NO IT DOESN'T DOES NOT DO ANYTHING
BUT I IT'S JUST A YEAH IT'S IT'S CHEAP
NO BUT THAT'S THE GADGET THEY WANT OR THE GIMMICKS
YES WE WE SHOULD REALLY UH INCLUDE THAT ONE I THINK
UM
WELL AS I SAID UH EARLIER I THINK THE UH L. C. D. SCREEN SHOULD BE UH POSITIONED AT THE LOWER END OF THE REMOTE
UM THE BUTTONS FOR SCREEN WIDTH AND GENERAL SETTINGS AND UH AND THAT KIND OF STUFF
UM WE CAN ALSO DO LET THAT KIND OF FUNCTIONS UM BE SHOWN IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN UH INSTEAD OF UH EXTRA BUTTONS
I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE AND YEAH W WELL EVERY USER WOULD LIKE THAT
UM THE BUTTONS UM SHOULD BE POSITIONED UH POSITIONED THE SAME WAY AS THEY ARE ON A WELL CONVENTIONAL REMOTE I THINK
FOR THE LEARNABILITY AND UH WELL TO KEEP IT RECOGNISABLE
A VOICE RECOGNITION CAN BE UH IMPLEMENTED
AND UH I DREW AN EXAMPLE BUT IT DID NOT WORK QUITE THE WELL UH THE WAY I WANTED IT TO DO
HMM
WELL I HAVE THE I CAN DRAW IT AGAIN AND I KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG
I DIDN'T TICK THE NOTE BO BOX IN THE
UM
UM WITH THE UH THE UP AND DOWN AND AND WELL BUTTONS AND THE
WELL I WILL DRAW WHAT I HAD DRAWN ON THE SCREEN
YES
UM I SHALL DRAW THIS
IF IT UH WORKS
MM SO HAVE I
NAH
WELL THESE LITTLE BUTTONS ARE A BIT DIFFICULT TO UH DRAW UH
CORRECT
YEAH JUST UH THE NUMBERS
THESE THESE WILL BE BIGGER IN THE THE REAL DESIGN
THIS MUST BE THE OKAY BUTTON USED TO UH INTERACT WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN
AND WITH THIS YOU CAN UH YES GO TO THROUGH THE MENUS AND THAT CAN
UM THE VIDEO BUTTON SHOULD BE UH AN APART BUTTON BECAUSE YOU WANT IT TO UH T YEAH TO USE IT FAST WITHIN ONE UH CLICK
UM IT'S
HMM
THIS BUTTON CAN ALSO BE THE MENU BUTTON WE USE IN THE MENUS WELL WE WE CAN ADD ANOTHER BUTTON HERE BUT
YEAH
AH RIGHT
WELL YOU YOU
NO NO WE WE WE SHOULD UH ADD UH A EXTRA MENU BUTTON AND THIS THE OKAY BUTTON
AH ONCE YOU HAVE AN EXTRA MENU BUTTON YOU DON'T NEED THAT THAT EXTRA OPTION
YOU HAVE UH REDUNDANCY
YEAH IF WE DECIDE TO UH TO IMPLEMENT THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD
WELL THEY THAT COULD BE ANYWHERE
THAT'S VERY SMALL
IT COULD BE UH DOWN HERE
UM
WELL NOT HERE
I YEAH I SUGGEST HERE
BUT THAT'S JUST A LITTLE GAP
YEAH
WELL THE SPEAKER AND THE MICROPHONE I THINK ARE THE SAME UH LITTLE HOLE THINGY
YEAH
WELL I
UM THERE ARE A ALL ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED IN IN COFFEE MACHINES SO THEY WON'T BE UH VERY EXPENSIVE
BUT
THIS IS MY SUGGESTED DESIGN
UM YES
AND OH I THINK AS YOU CAN SEE SO THE L. C. D. SCREEN DOES LOOK BETTER UH AT THE LOWER END OR AT THE BOTTOM
BUT
OH UM I HAD SOME UH EXAMPLES
YOU CAN UH
BUT
I DID NOT LIKE IT VERY MUCH BUT
WELL THESE ARE
QUITE OBVIOUS VERY UGLY REMOTE
UM
NO WELL TH
YEAH
WELL NOT ALL
UH THIS IS FOR CHILDREN BUT TH
NO
W BUT WITH THE COLOURS I IT'S A BIT THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO
WELL THIS IS A TERRIBLE
UM THIS LOOKS YEAH
THIS UH THESE ARE THE L. C. D. SCREENS
I THINK WE SHOULD IF IT'S UM POSSIBLE UH ONE WITH COLOURS BUT
I DON'T KNOW UH TOO EXPENSIVE
ALRIGHT
WELL NAH
HA EVEN MORE
N
WELL
YEAH THIS IS WHAT WE'VE JUST DONE
RIGHT
AH RIGHT
NOT EVERYTHING
YEAH BUT ALL THESE EXAMPLES ARE UH OF A COFFEE MACHINE
I THINK WE WHY DON'T WE UM USE UH TITANIUM OR OR A HARD
YEAH SOME KIND OF METAL FOR THE UH THE THE WHOLE REMOTE EXCEPT THE FRONT
THAT
JUST LIKE UM MOST CELL PHONES ARE
YEAH
YEAH
NO BUT YOU YOU HAVE THIS YEAH
YEAH YOU HAVE THE RE REMOTE IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS
SO YOU FEEL TITANIUM
YEAH
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN MAKE STEEL JUST ANY WAY YOU WANT IT TO
YEAH
WELL ANY COLOUR
YEAH THEN YOU YOU PAINT IT IN THE COLOUR YOU WANT IT
THE PLASTIC IS IS THE COLOUR YOU WANT IT
SO YEAH
MM
YEAH
WELL TITANIUM IS NEUTRAL
HMM
YEAH
WELL
OUR CUSTOMERS WILL USE THOSE UH FUNKY UH TRENDY COLOURS AND THEY DON'T USE UH WOOD
MM
YEAH
YEAH
THE ELECTRICAL CABLE UH DOES
NO WE DON'T USE AN ELECTRICAL CABLE
YEAH INSIDE BUT THIS IS FOR THE COFFEE UH MACHINE
YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S MEANT HERE I THINK
YEAH
WELL I GOT A BETTER ONE HERE AND I WILL UM
THE SHARED FOLDER
I WILL WORK THIS OUT UH FOR THE UH NEXT MEETING
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE FRONT
YES
BUT THAT'S FOR LATER ON
THE FRONTS Y YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH THEM
YEAH RIGHT FOR THE UH INITIATIVE UH LAUNCH
MM
OH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN GIVE THEM UH S S THREE OR SO SO THAT THEY CAN UH EXPERIMENT WITH IT AND THAT THEY WANT MORE
YEAH
RED RED BLUE AND GREEN YOU GIVE THEM OR SOMETHING AND THEN YOU CAN GIVE THEM UH OTHER ONES
YEAH WE SHOULD DO THAT
MM
YEAH WE CAN DO THAT
BUT BU WE STAY WE STAY HERE OR SOMETHING
AH RIGHT
AND TAKE IT TO OUR ROOMS AND UH
AH SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE SENT TO YOU BY YOUR PERSONAL COACH
YEAH
UM
WILL WE USE UH ROUND BUTTONS OR SQUARE ONES FOR THE FOR THE NUMBERS
YEAH I I I ALSO UH THOUGHT YEAH
AND THESE UH THESE S THESE BUTTONS UH ARE MORE UH TRIANGLE ISH SHAPED WITH A SQUARE ONE IN THE MIDDLE
YEAH
YEAH
MM
WELL MOST OF THE TIME UH UP AND DOWN IS PROGRAMME AND LEFT AND RIGHT ARE VOLUME I THINK
YEAH IT DEPENDS BUT
IF YOU TURN UP THE VOLUME YOU ALWAYS SEE THIS THINGY GO UP
YEAH
YEAH ALRIGHT
MM
UH I I'D SAY ONLY THE LOGO
TOO MUCH TEXT AND IT GETS TOO TOO BUSY
WELL IT'S QUITE A LONG PHRASE
AH THE LOGO SHOULD BE ON THE TOP I THINK
RIGHT CORNER YES
UH THE TEXT
YEAH
UH YEAH AT THE BACK
WELL YOU C WELL UH YES
YOU CAN THE LOGO CAN BE ON ON EVERY UH FRONT
YEAH BUT THEN YOU MUST UH REALLY UH YEAH PUSH IT IN OR SOMETHING
YEAH ON THE BACKSIDE
WELL N N NOT NOT ON THE FRONT SIDE I THINK
ON THE BACK YES YOU YOU CAN YEAH PUSH THAT IN SO THAT IT IS ALWAYS BE THERE
YEAH
YEAH I THINK OVER HERE THE LOGO
YES WE COULD
NO THEY HAVE TWO FRONTS THAT
YOU YOU CAN YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST AND THEN NOT A STRAIGHT LINE BUT UH SOME SORT OF WAVE OR SOMETHING
THIS IS TITANIUM
AND THIS IS UH
F FRONT
YEAH
WITH THE WITH THE CURVED EDGE
YEAH
YEAH
TADA
YEAH
AH
YEAH THAT'S NICE FINISHING TOUCH YOU NEED
YEAH THIS IS THE FRONT
THIS IS THE
MY DESIGN
YEAH
WE'LL STAY HERE I GUESS
WELL WE CAN UH ERASE AN ANIMAL I GUESS
UH THE FOURTH ONE
UH THE FOURTH ONE IS EMPTY ISN'T IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT
MAYBE
YEAH
AHA
THIS HAS NO FUNCTION
WE'VE DONE TOO MUCH IN THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS
YES WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO NOW
ITS THE BEST REMOTE EVER
PINBALL
YES BUT YOU YOU GET REALLY CLOSE TO THE SCREEN WITH YOUR HAND AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S
HMM
WE CAN BETTER UH DRAW A DESIGN ON THIS
YEAH BUT WE CAN'T
WELL
WE'LL STAY HERE
OR WE'LL GET THE EMAIL
YEAH
WELL WE'LL WAIT A FEW SECONDS AND THEN WE'LL GET AN EMAIL
YEAH
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
EASY TO USE
I THINK THAT'S YOUR TA
MM
YOU YEAH
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN MAKE A VERY COMPLICATED UH UH REMOTE ANYWAY SO EASE OF USE IT'S NOT A VERY COMP COMPLICATED DEVICE
ALRIGHT
UH YOU THINK
MM
MM
ALRIGHT
YEAH AMONG THE OLD PEOPLE YEAH
RIGHT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMPONENTS DESIGN
UH AGAIN I HAVE UH PUT UP THE SPECIFICATION PROPERTIES
THIS UH SO UM UH THE DIFFERENT UH COMPONENTS OF THE OF OF THE DEVICE
AND THE MATERIALS
UM I HAVE HEARD SEVERAL THINGS SO I UH I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE THAT ON THE WAY
BUT UH THE CASE
UH I SUGGESTED UH IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING HARD PLASTIC
BUT UH AS YOU INDICATED UH IT SHOULD BE STRONG
IT SHOULD FEEL STRONG
SO MAYBE PLASTIC IS NOT UH SUFFICIENT
WE SHOULD MOVE TO UH SOMETHING
WELL YEAH
Y HARD PLASTIC I IS OF COURSE UH PRETTY PRETTY TOUGH BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A REALLY REALLY TOUGH LOOK
SO
YEAH
ALSO YEAH
MM-HMM
BUT WE'LL RETURN TO THAT
UH THE BUTTONS OF COURSE RUBBER I THINK EVERYONE AGREES
AND ELECTRICAL CABLES COPPER IS ALL PRETTY BASIC STUFF
THE CHIPS MADE OF SILICON I GUESS
I THINK THAT'S THE BEST UH WAY TO DO IT
AND INFRA INFRARED L LED IS UH JUST A SIMPLE BULB
THEN I'VE UH HAD A FEW FINDINGS MADE A FEW FINDINGS
UH THE TARGET AUDIENCE PRODUCT STYLE
UM IT'S UH UM GENERALLY THE CASE THAT UH SENIOR AND WEALTHY PEOPLE ABOVE UH FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD UH LIKE
AS YOU SAID UH PARTICULARLY THE TRADITIONAL MATERIALS AS SUCH AS WOOD AND MATERIALS SUCH AS THAT
THEY ALSO LIKE STRAIGHTFORWARD SHAPES AND LUXURIOUS STYLE
BUT OF COURSE THAT'S NOT OUR UH THINGS THIS
SO THIS IS THINGS WE MUST NOT DO
AND THEN WE HAVE UH YOUNG UH AND DYNAMIC UH PEOPLE WHICH IS OF COURSE OUR UH GROUP THE PEOPLE WE AIM AT
UM UNDER FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD
UH THEY LIKE SOFT MATERIALS UH WITH PRIMARY COLOURS
SOFT MATERIALS IS OF COURSE UH AGAI AGAIN A BIT A CONTRADICTION WITH UH OUR UH MATERIAL CHOICE OF WHAT YOU SAID
THAT UH IT SHOULD BE HARD AN AND AND AND AND STRONG LOOKING
BUT THEY LIKE SOFT MATERIALS UH SO WE MIGHT UH WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT
AND
ALSO THEY LIKE CURVED ROUND SHAPES
SO NOT UH TOO FORMAL LIKE LIKE UH THE OLDER PEOPLE WANT
AND IF UH ALSO A FINDING BUT NOT VERY AP APPLICABLE HERE THAT SPORTS AND GAMING DEVICES SUCH AS UH
DISCMANS FOR JOGGING AND THAT THOSE KIND OF DEVICES GAMING DEVICES SHOULD DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEVICE
BUT UH SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A REALLY A SPORTS OR GAMING DEVICE SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT
MM
WELL I ALSO HAVE UM
SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF UH STYLES SO YOU CAN GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF UH WHAT I MEAN
UH THESE ARE THE BASIC UH OLDER OLDER PEOPLES' STUFF
IT WAS NOT VERY UH INTERESTING UH VERY CLASSICAL LOOKING BUT THAT'S N THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT
WE HAVE THESE KIND OF THINGS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY THEY ARE
IT LOOKS LIKE WELL YOU KNOW UH YOU RECOGNISE THE SHAPES IT'S VERY PRIMARY COLOURS UH BRIGHT COLOURS AND UH ROUND SHAPES
YOU ALSO UH SEE UH THIS DEVICE IT'S NOT VERY ROUND AND FRUITY OF COURSE
YEAH IT UH THAT'S TRUE
AND UH WELL ROUND SHAPES PRIMARY COLOURS
YOU CAN SEE IT ALL HERE
AND OF COURSE UH THIS FAMOUS DEVICE
I THINK AS YOU KNOW SOMETHING UH SOME DEVICES LIKE THIS
SO TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF UH
THIS HAS A STRONG LOOK
ALTHOUGH IT'S PLASTIC IT'S IT'S GREY TO TO TO GIVE IT IRON LOOK
THAT'S UH
YEAH
WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE A
WELL WE CAN'T REALLY MAKE A ROUND UH A ROUND REMOTE CONTROL
I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY PRACTICAL BUT BUT UH IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO UH TO THINK ABOUT THE COLOUR
BECAUSE IF WE MAKE IT GREY OR OR SILVERY LOOKING IT IT DOES MAKE IT A LOT MORE UH DOES MAKE IT LOOKING A LOT MORE STRONGER
'CAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IT IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY VERY STRONG BECAU BUT THIS IS PLASTIC AND AND THIS TOO BUT
THE FEEL
UH ALRIGHT
WELL
MM-HMM
AND I THEN I HAVE SOME MORE FINDINGS
UM UH ABOUT THE ENERGY ENERGY SOURCE OF THE OF THE DEVICE UH I UH SUGGEST UH THE BASIC BATTERY
I UH GOT SOME OTHER UM UH UH ENERGY SOURCES OF COURSE
BUT SOLAR ENERGY IS NOT VERY PRACTICAL INSIDE A HOUSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A HAVE A LOT OF UH SUN
AND UH KINETIC AND AND AND DYNAMOS ARE ARE NOT VERY PRACTICAL I THINK
FOR UH FOR A SIMPLE REMOTE THAT'S A BIT OH THAT'S A BIT UH
THAT'S A BIT UH MUCH
AND I ALSO SUGGEST UH AS A SHAPE UH A DOUBLE CURVED CASE
UH THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT THAT YOU CAN USE NO TITANIUM
THAT THAT'S THE INFORMATION I RECEIVED
IF YOU USE THE CURVED CASE UH A CURVED CASE DOUBLE CURVED THEN YOU
CAN'T USE TITANIUM
NOW UH THIS UH TO GIVE IT A MORE MODERN LOOK
AND UH NOW THE THE SHAPE YEAH A CURVED CASE
UM YEAH I THINK UH SORT OF TRIANGLE SHAPED BOTTOM OR SOMETHING
UH A MORE MODERN LOOK NOT PLAIN LONG BOX STYLE BUT
I'LL DRAW IT BUT MAYBE LATER
AND IT MAKES UH IT GIVES IT A MORE U USER FRIENDLY SHAPE THAN IF YOU HAVE UH
UM ANYWAY
UM F AS UH FOR THE BUTTONS SIMPLE PUSH BUTTONS
NO UH OTHERWI UH NO UM DIFFICULT SCROLL THINGS OR SOME UH THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT MAKES MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE
AND UH AS WE AGREED WE DON'T USE A SPEAKER OR A SENSOR OR UM UH SPEAK UH SPEECH UH CONTROLLED DEVICE
BECAUSE IT MAKES IT ALSO MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE
BUT WE DO USE AN L. C. D. SCREEN SO WE UH WE DO HAVE TO CONSIDER UH OF WE HAVE TO USE A MORE ADVANCED CHIP
WHICH IS MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE
BUT
IT'S WORTH THE TROUBLE I THINK BECAUSE
UH RUBBER IS A SOFT MATERIAL I GUESS
UH SOFT ENOUGH
SO THAT'S UH BASICALLY WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
OH YEAH I UNDERSTAND
YEAH
YEAH
BUT IT IT'S N NICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
THEY LIKE GADGETS
YEAH
IF IT'S CHEAP
YEAH
CAN YOU DRAW IT NOW OF UH CAN YOU DRAW IT NOW
MM
ALRIGHT
BUTTON YEAH
I SUGGEST A BANANA SHAPE
BECAUSE OF THE FRUITY UH FASHION
YELLOW AND
YEAH ALRIGHT YEAH
JUST A HUNCH
THOSE ARE THE THE CHA THE CHANNEL BUTTONS OF COURSE
AND THEN BELOW IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
ALRIGHT YEAH
MM-HMM
UH BY PE PRESSING THE MENU BUTTON AGAIN
BY PRESSING THE MENU BUTTON AGAIN YOU GO UH OUT
IT'S USUAL THE THE THE D KIND OF THE WAY IT WORKS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT YOU CAN MEN YOU CAN PRESS MENU AGAIN TO GET OUT
NO
WHY WOULD YOU PUT IT UH THEN AND WHERE IS THE RECORDING UH THE MICROPHONE
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT IT
UH-HUH
MICROPHONE YEAH
YEAH I UNDERSTAND
UH BUT UH WE COULD UH D DO BUT IT'S PERHAPS MORE EXPENSIVE UH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OR SOMETHING
ALRIGHT
WELL YEAH YEAH YEAH
I CAN LIVE WITH IT
THEY DO THEY DON'T LOOK FRUITY ENOUGH
THO YEAH THOSE
BUT IT DOESN'T UH THE
YEAH OK YEAH
BUT IT IT MUST NOT LOOK TOO CHILDISH OF COURSE HUH
BUT IT YEAH
NOT NOT TOO STRANGE
NO
EXOTIC YEAH
WE HAVE T YEAH YEAH
I WILL DESIGN IT WE DESIGN IT LATER
SO WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER I GUESS
THE SPECIFIC SHAPE
THE
OUR SOURCES
BUT UH WE SHOULD DECIDE NOW
SO WE HAVE TO UH PUT IT IN ONE UH DOCUMENT
COPY PASTE UH THIS STORY INTO A INTO A WORD DOCUMENT AND THEN UH PUT THE ANSWERS AFTER THE SUBJECTS
YEAH
WELL WE HAVE TO DECIDE ALL THESE THINGS
W WE CAN UH OVERRIDE THEM
WELL A CASE
UH THAT'S ME
UH I SUGGEST WELL WHAT DO I SUGGEST ACTUALLY
UH S SOLID YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I UNDERSTAND
YEAH
SO WE HAVE TITANIUM
YEAH BUT THE NON REMOVABLE ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE REMOTE SO NOT THE FRONT COULD BE TITANIUM TO GIVE THAT UH STRONG LOOK
AND THEN THE FRONT IS MADE OF PLASTIC
AND YOU CAN PUT THAT ON AND OFF AND SWITCH IT
NO BUT YOU HAVE TITANIUM OF COURSE
UH YOU HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
AND OF COURSE YEAH YOU HAVE THE THE THE PLASTIC FRONT END
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE TITANIUM
YEAH OF COURSE BUT YEAH YOU HAVE TO MAKE A
DECISION
I GUESS SO
UH TITANIUM I SH I THINK UH
HUH
WELL WELL THE
ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES UH IT'S IT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN ENTIRE UH UH UH TITANIUM IS AVAILABLE
AND UH WE CAN UH MAKE UH AN ENTIRE REMOTE OUT OF IT IF WE WANT
MM
MM
YEAH I THINK THAT'S A NICE TRADE OFF
ALRIGHT
YEAH FOR THE FRONT AND THEN TITANIUM FOR THE BACK
FOR THE NON REMOVABLE UH PART
WELL BUT
THE TITAN TITANIUM ISN'T ISN'T V VERY YEAH I IT DOESN'T UH CURVES
NO UH I NEI
TITANIUM IS VERY NO NO NO BUT YOU KNOW B TITANIUM IS VERY BASIC COLOUR
AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF WE HAVE A PURPLE FRONT ON IT OR A ORANGE FRONT
I DUNNO IF IF YOU DISAGREE BUT I THINK IT'S DOESN'T MATTER VERY MUCH
AND EVEN IF IT DOES UH DOESN'T MATCH IT WILL UH PEOPLE LIKE MM COLOURS THAT DON'T MATCH
COP COPPER UH MATERIAL
EXCUSE ME
YEAH COPPER I JUST A BA BASIC UH
YEAH IN
YEAH WELL INSIDE THE REMOTE CONTROL WE USE A COUPLE OF UH
OH EXTERNAL
WELL A COFFEE GRIND DOESN'T HAVE NA JA
NEVER MIND THE COFFEE GRIND
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH THE THE THE FRONT W
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH
FOR THE FOR THE LAUNCH YEAH
SO E TH THEN A C COUPLE OF BASIC COLOURS
NOT NOT VERY UH SIM NOT
YEAH
YEAH
VERY BORING YEAH
THE MOST BORING FRONTS POSSIBLE
YEAH BUT YOU YOU CAN HAVE SOME BASIC COLOURS AND THEN WE COME WITH THE SPECIAL PATTERNS ON THEM AND AND UH AND UH
UH WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE WE HAVE STILL HAVE TO MAKE THE ES THE THE REAL BASIC DESIGN
BECAUSE YEAH WE HAVE THE SKETCH BUT
ALRIGHT YEAH
THE PRICE
WE ALL AGREE ON THAT
YEAH
TOGETHER OR UH YEAH TOGETHER
HOW YEAH YEAH BUT HOW DO I
SOME
SOME NON FUNCTIONAL TASKS
YOU'RE FIRED
NO BUT
WELL CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
UH
UH NO I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING BUT MAYBE UH ANYONE ELSE UH YEAH
ROUND I THINK
TO MAKE IT AS UH AS ROUND AS POSSIBLE
BUT NOW I SEE THE
WELL TH TH TH TH TH THAT DEPENDS UH
WELL WE UH
WE WE J WE'LL JUST GIVE THEM AN UH WE'LL DESIGN IT AND THEN THEY CAN GIVE COMMENTS ON IT
WELL YEAH
UM I THINK UM A LOGO OUR COMPANY LOGO AND THE SLOGAN SHOULD BE OR COULD BE YEAH WHY NOT
IF THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE YOU CAN PUT UH WE'LL WE'LL
WELL OUR SLOGAN IS NOT VERY LONG
IT'S JUST A SIMPLE WHAT IS IT
YOU C
BUT YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE BACK ON THE TITANIUM PART
THE LOGO AND THE AND THE
YEAH THEY DO
WELL YEAH
RIGHT CORNER OR MAYBE HERE IN THE MIDDLE
YEAH IT IT SHOULD BE HARD ON THE ON THE ON THE BOARD AND YOU CAN REMOVE THE FRONT
I L I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE OF THE SLOGAN ON THE ON THE ON THE THING
BUT AM I THE ONLY ONE OR UH
NO NOT ON THE FRONT BUT ON THE BACKSIDE
UH
I THINK IT'S A NICE IDEA TO MAKE IT MORE RECOGNISABLE THAT THE NEXT TO THE LOGO YOU HAVE THE SLOGAN
TO MAKE MORE UH OF AN IMPRESSION
NOT TOO BIG
NO VERY SMALL
NOT ON THE ENTIRE BACK BUT UH JUST VERY SMALL
BUT READABLE ENOUGH OF COURSE
BUT WE'LL UH WE'LL TAKE THAT UH WITH US INTO THE DESIGN
LO UH YEAH
OR MAYBE HERE IN THE MIDDLE BUT WE'LL DECIDE LATER
DO YOU DO YOU SEE A BIT OF THE OF THE UM
OF THE UH TITANIUM
O ON THE FRONT
UH MAYBE IF WE MAKE THIS THIS THIS LOWER PART TITANIUM THE FRONT IS THE THE UPPER PART AND THE THE BIT WITH THE WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN
SO
YEAH
NO NO BETWE OF BETWEEN WE CAN DO BUT BUT THEN YOU HAVE TWO PARTS OF FRONT TWO FRONTS THAT
THIS ENTI ENTIRE BOTTOM
AND THEN THE LOWER PART IS TITANIUM
I THINK THAT'S NICE YEAH
YEAH
I LIKE THAT BIT OF UH TITANIUM ALSO ON THE UH
A BIT LIKE UH A BIT LIKE YOUR MOBILE PHONE
MAYBE YOU CAN SHOW IT
IT ALSO HAS THE THOSE TWO DISTINCT UH
MM BIT LIKE THIS
UH IT'S UH
YEAH YEAH
THAT UH YEAH
MAYBE A NICE TOUCH YEAH
I THINK I'M GOING TO BUY IT
THAT'S A BIT TOO MUCH BUT NO NO NO NO BUT I THINK UH THIS LOOKS UH PRETTY NICE ACTUALLY
OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S MY DESIGN BUT NO OUR D OUR DESIGN ALRIGHT
BUT DON'T ERASE MY CAT
I WANT TO PRESERVE IT
WHAT ARE YOU DOING CHIEF
YEAH UNTIL THE UNTIL THE BEEP GOES
BUT I DON'T UH DO WE HAVE TO STAY HERE OR I THINK WE HAVE TO RETURN FIRST
THE HIGH POWERS FROM ABOVE WILL HAVE TO TELL US YEAH
YEAH TOUCH PADS YEAH
WE CAN UH DO A TOUCH PAD ON OUR REMOTE
NO JUST KIDDING
WELL WE HAVE UH B YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BIT OF HUMOUR IN THE IN THE DISCUSSIONS TOO BECAUSE IT BECOMES TOO TOO TOO TOO STRESSY
BUT UH TH YOUTH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT FUNCTIO FUNCTIONALITY SO
YEAH
BLESS YOU
MM
TOO MUCH
WELL THEY UH
I THINK THAT'S GOOD
WE ALL HAD UH OUR TALK AND
WE AGREE I GUESS ON UH SEVERAL THING ON MOST UH ON THINGS
YEAH YOU HAVE TO PUSH HARDER
MM
WHERE'S THE GOOD OLD CHALK BOARD WITH THE
THE GREEN BOARD WITH THE HOW DO YOU CALL IT CHALK YEAH
YEAH MAYBE
MAYBE IF I IF THAT THING IS RECALIBRATED WE CAN DRAW A THING QUICK AND THEN BEFORE IT UH
GOES OFF AGAIN

A HAPPY HOL HAPPY HOLIDAYS
I'M LISTENING

IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT UH THE CONTROL IS FANCY LOOKING AND GOOD UH FEELING
UH THIS BECAUSE OF OUR LAST MODEL WAS VERY FUNCTIONAL BUT IT UH PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THAT SO OUR NEW MO MODEL MUST BE VERY GOOD LOOKING
THAT'S UH SOMETHING YOU UH HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT
AND UH THE FEELING HAS TO BE VERY GREAT
ALSO THE MENUS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEY HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO FEEL GREAT
UM THERE'S A MINUS UH TWO TIMES HERE BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT
THIS IS UH TWO TIMES AS LESS IMPORTANT AND UH SAME FOR THIS ONE
UM TECHNOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS THAT'S UH REGARDED VERY HIGHLY TOO
UH SUCH AS AN UH L. C. D. SCREEN UH SPEECH UH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AS WE UH TALKED ABOUT EARLIER
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE UH SOMETHING LIKE THAT LIKE WE UH
RIGHT
UH THE LAST POINT IS EASY TO USE
WELL I THINK THAT UH SPEAKS FOR S FOR ITSELF
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S UH WHO'S GOING TO LOOK AT THAT
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW
I THINK WE HAVE TO GO FOR THE FIRST ONE
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
SO WE HAVE TO UH TAKE THAT ONE

WE'LL SEE
YEAH RIGHT
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IT LOOKS GREAT AND PEOPLE SAY WOW THAT'S REAL GREAT UH GREAT CONCEPT
ALRIGHT
UH THESE ARE THE NEW COLOURS OF THIS YEAR
SO IT MUST BE VERY BRIGHT VERY COLOURFUL
PEOPLE LIKE THIS
SO WE WE HAVE TO THINK UH IN THIS DIRECTION
SO I SET YOUR MIND TO IT
FINDINGS
FASHION UPDATE
FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE COOL
I AM TOLD
THE GROUP WE ARE TARGETING IS UH VERY PLEASED WITH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
SO WE WE WE MIGHT CONS CONSIDER IN FRONT OF UH IN IN THAT SORT OF UH WAY
UH FURTHERMORE UH MATERIAL THAT'S YOUR PART SHOULD BE VERY STRONG
I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING LIKE UH WELL UH IRON PLATE OVER IT
MAYBE IN A COLOUR OR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS SO F REALLY FLASHY BUT IT IT IS ALSO STRONG
AND THAT'S UH ALSO FOR THE YOUNGER PUBLIC
YEAH THAT'S GREAT
BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL MAKE THE THE FRONTS OF TITANIUM OR SOMETHING UH REALLY THIN
SO IT LOOKS VERY HEAVY BUT YOU CAN STILL UH USE IT VERY EASILY
WELL THE DON'TS
OLDER PEOPLE LIKE DARK COLOURS AND SIMPLE SHAPES
WELL WE DON'T WANT UH OLDER PEOPLE WE WANT YOUNG PEOPLE
SO UH WE'RE GONNA TURN THAT AROUND
WE'RE GONNA HAVE REAL UH COOL SHAPES AND LOTS OF COLOURS
RIGHT
OKAY
WE DON'T WANT WOOD
OLD PEOPLE

YEAH WE SHOULD CHANGE THAT
NO NO NO
MM
YEAH
WE KEEP COMING BACK TO THE FRONTS
YEAH
FRUITY
FRUITY
WELL IT'S GOT A STRONG LOOK THIS
YEAH
YEAH IT STILL HAS A STRONG LOOK
BUT THEN YOU ARE LOSING YOUR FRUITY COLOURS
THAT'S TRUE
YEAH BUT THE
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK STRONG
THE THE RESULTS ARE THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL IS EXPECTED TO BE STRONGY
THE FEEL
NAH YEAH THE FEEL
RIGHT
I AGREE
I DUNNO
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT
OH OKAY
RIGHT
NO
BUT THAT THAT MAKES IT CHEAP
IT'S IT'S JUST A AN EXTRA FUNCTION AND IT'S CHEAP
NO BUT
YEAH RIGHT
YOUNG PEOPLE LOVE THEM
YEAH PLE
RIGHT
ALRIGHT
HOW HOW
HOW DO YOU UH UH GIVE INPUT TO THE MENU ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN
ALRIGHT
SO YOU HAVE A MENU BUTTON AND THEN YOU CAN GO UP AND DOWN
YEAH RIGHT
YEAH
YOU HAVE TO PUSH HARD
YEAH
YEAH
YOU'VE
RIGHT
AND YOU YOU NEED A YOU NEED A SPEAKER

ALRIGHT
ALRIGHT
YEAH FINE
MOVE ON
YEAH
NEI THEY'RE N THEY'RE NOT TRENDY
IT DOESN'T LOOK STRONG
YEAH RIGHT
THIS IS JUST CRAZY
NAH TH IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
YEAH
BUT ARE WE GOING FOR A STRANGE UH FORM
'CAUSE PEOPLE LIKE THAT
NOT TOO STRANGE
YOU CAN MAKE THE THE UNDERSIDE YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE ROUND WHERE THE L. C. D. IS
I DUNNO IF YOU KNOW THE NO NOKIA TELEPHONE WITH UH THE ROUND UH THING AT AT THE BOTTOMS S SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU KNOW
YEAH BUT PEOPLE LIKE SOMETHING UH NEW YOU KNOW
YEAH DIFFERENT
Y YIS

BENDABLE
BENDABLE
YEAH
PAINT SPRAY
YEAH ALRIGHT
SO WE'RE GOING FOR A TITANIUM BACK AND A PLASTIC FRONT
YEAH GREAT
YEAH
BUT THEN YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE A TITANIUM BACK YOU CAN'T SWITCH IT

YOU KNOW
I UNDERSTAND
YEAH YEAH YEAH

IT'S BETTER IF YOU HAVE IT UH
YEAH
I AGREE
BUT NOT TOO BIG
JUST UH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
NO NO NO NO
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS TITANIUM TOO

LIKE DUST IN IT AND SO THINGS LIKE THAT
WHEN YOU EXCHANGE ALL THE FRONTS AND IT'S OPEN
YEAH
SOME SOME KIND OF WEI WEIGHT IN IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YOU CAN MAKE IT GO
ROUND THIS CORNER TOO WHERE THE LOGO IS
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE UH THERE ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW
SO UH A LITTLE CORNER OF TITANIUM

THEN UM I GUESS THAT'S YOUR BIT
I I DIDN'T S SEE ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO I ALREADY UH THOUGHT YOU UH YOU WERE TO DO THAT
SO THE YOU'RE UH
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH FINANCING THIS UH DESIGN
AND THEN WE'LL EVALUATE AFTER AFTER WE HAVE REDESIGNED IT

SO LET IT BE LIKE THIS AT UH AT THIS MOMENT
OKAY
NO I THINK IT'S GREAT
COMES TO THAT LATER
UM YOU

UH DO WE FIND IT GOOD LOOKING
WELL WE THINK SO
UH
YEAH
WELL ONE
WELL SO IT'S POINT FOUR
EASY TO FIND T
TWO
NO
I TOTALLY AGREE
WE WE HAVE TO GET GET ON GO THROUGH THIS
NO NOT FALSE
IT'S ONE
WELL UH TWO
Y WELL WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT
YEP
TWO
WELL NO
WE DIDN'T IMPLEMENT ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
WELL SIX THEN
ARE THE FUNCTIONS EASY TO LEARN
WELL W I WE DO WANT WE HAVE A L F F LESS OF AN
AND THE DEVICE R. S. I. SENSITIVE
YEAH
AH
YEAH BUT JUST DO SOME WE WE
I TH I TH I THINK THIS IS TOO TIME CONSUMING
UH NOT NOT TOWARDS YOU BUT TOWARDS THIS ALL
TH THIS IS
WE YOU HAVE TO PUT IT TO THE CUSTOMERS
UH WELL WELL A BIT SO FOUR
YES
ONE
AND FEATURES INCLUDED ALSO ONE
AND ONE
UH THOSE UH NINE UH IS THE FANCY LOOKING
UH WE STILL THINK SO
DEVICE FANCY FEELING
YEAH COOL MAN
ARE THERE ENOUGH TECHNOLOGY
YEAH WELL ALSO WE HAVE TWO
IS THE DEVICE EASY TO USE
YES WE HAVE NOT MANY BUTTONS
TWO THREE
ARE THE TRENDS ABOUT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IMPLEMENTED
WELL IN OUR COVERS IN OUR FRONTS
SO YES ONE
IS THE MATERIAL ATTRACTIVE
OH OKAY
OKAY
IS THE MATERIAL ATTRACTIVE
WELL THE TITANIUM IS STRONG AND UH THE REST F UH THE BUTTONS FEEL SOFT
SO I WOULD SAY AT LEAST TWO
OKAY
WELL YEAH
YES BUT WE WE HAVE TO DESIGN MUCH MORE BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME IRRITATING ACCOUNT MANAGER COMING TO ME
UM
OH
UH
YES
WELL LOOK AT THE COSTS AT THIS POINT
I HAD TO FIT IT IN
I TWELVE AND A HALF
SO
WELL WHAT COSTS A LOT
THE SAMPLE SPEA COSTS FOUR
THE SAMPLE SPEAKER THE S SENSOR
KICK IT OUT
WE HAVE TO GO TO TWELVE AND A HALF
THE SPEAKER COSTS FAR BY FAR THE MOST
IT IT ISN'T WORTH IT
WE COULD MAKE TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS ONE WITH AND ONE WITHOUT
BUT FOR THIS
SO ZERO
THEN WE GO TO FOURTEEN POINT SIX
WELL THE TITANIUM I DON'T WANT TO LOSE ACTUALLY
L. C. THREE
YEAH HAND DYNAMO
Y T COME ON W A REMOTE CONTROL HAS A BATTERY
WELL BE FOR THE L. C. D. UH YOU HAD SAID
WELL WHAT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIMPLE AND REGULAR
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SIMPLE AND A REGULAR CHIP
AND SIMPLE
NOTHING
WELL
YOUR PART
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DO
HOW MUCH DO WE WIN
ONE
YEAH
WELL WE COULD SAY WELL THIS SPECIAL COLOUR THAT ISN'T THAT THAT ISN'T THERE BECAUSE THE THE FRONTS THEY WILL BUY IT
THE SPECIAL COLOUR
YEAH THEN YOU S THEN YOU ONLY HAVE ONE HALF LEFT
UH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO THE ADVANCED CHIP IS NEEDED TO HAVE AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
SAYS HIS UH THAT WAS IN THE SECOND MEETING I THINK
WELL I I DID SINGLE CURVE TO WELL YOU SAID S DOUBLE CURVED UH HE BECAUSE UH I THOUGHT IT'S A B A BIT CHEAPER ALREADY
WE CAN ALSO MAKE IT FLAT
BUT
CURVED
YES THAT'S CURVED
YES
NO IT'S ONE CURVE
ONE CURVE SIMPLE
WE HAVE A BIG FINANCIAL PROBLEM
WELL THEN WE HAVE TWO DOLLARS LESS PROFIT
COME ON IF WE IF WE IF WE MAKE THIS FIFTY MILLION THEY WON'T HESITATE TO UH CONGRATULATE US SO UH
BY THE WAY WE ALSO HAVE THIS ONE
OH COSTS NOTHING
THAT'S NICE
PLASTIC IS
YES BUT I JUST GOT IT
WHO
YOU WANT TO DUMP THE TITANIUM
AND MAKE ALL PLASTIC THEN WE HA THEN WE'RE THERE
TH THEN YOU HAVE A UGLY STUPID L UGLY LOOKING DUMB REMOTE THAT THAT NO ONE WOULD BUY
NO I DON'T THINK SO
YES
AND THE FEEL AND TH THAT IT IS STRONG AND
WE STILL WE HAD TO FOCUS TO GET MORE PEOPLE FROM THE YOUNGER GROUP BUT NOT LOSE THE ONE
WHY CAN'T I
I'LL PUT IN THE REPORT WE THAT WE THINK THAT FOURTEEN POINT ONE IS THE L M LOWEST PRICE YOU CAN MAKE A REMOTE FOR THAT'S TRENDY D THESE DAYS
I I'LL TALK TO THE MANAGERS
TITANIUM I THI I THINK THIS THIS IS THIS IS E REALLY GOOD RE REMOTE
BUT
AH THOSE THOSE ACCOUNT MANAGERS WHAT DO TH D WHAT DO THEY KNOW

WE HAVE TO DUMP OUR TITANIUM AND WE'LL HATE THE MANAGERS FOR THAT BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE OUR PROJECT OF UH PROJECT PROJECT
WELL SATISFACTION ON FOR EXAMPLE ARE WE SATISFACTORY ABOUT OUR CREATIVITY
I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE THAT WE GOT UH THOSE COSTS AT THE LAST MOMENT
THAT'S REALLY BAD
BUT THAT THAT THAT'S THAT YEAH THAT'S A REASON BUT ALSO FOR OUR CREATIVITY
WE HAD UM NICE DESIGN AND THEN YOU GET THE COST AND YOU HAD TO DUMP ALL YOUR CREATIVITY
YEAH
WELL ALRIGHT

UH IT'S PRETTY UH MUCH UH LIKE UH MIKE DRAW UH DREW UH THE IN THE DURING THE LAST MEETING
WITH UH THE DIFFERENT UH PERSPECTIVES OF IT
UH WE'LL BEGIN UH WITH THE FRONT
WE HAVE OF COURSE UH THE THE ROUND SHAPE UH THE ROUND UH BASIC SHAPE
UM WITH UH THE UPPER PART BEING THE FRONT
TH SO THERE'S THIS PART UM WHICH IS MADE OF HARD PLASTIC THE FRONT
AND UH WE'RE WE'RE USING DIFFERENT COLOURS
OF COURSE FOR THE LAUNCH WE USE THE BASIC UGLY COLOURS AND LATER WE'LL PUT OUT UH MORE INTERESTING COVERS WITH DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND PICTURES AND EVERYTHING
BUT BASICALLY DIFFERENT COLOURS BRIGHT COLOURS NOT BLACK TOO DARK
FANCY COLOURS
UM THEN WE HAVE UH THE LOWER PART
OF THE OF THE DEVICE
UH WHICH IS OF COURSE UM PART OF THE BACK ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT'S ALSO TITANIUM
YOU CAN SEE IT ALSO ON THE ON THE ON THE SIDE VIEW THAT ONLY THIS PART IS THE FRONT
AND THE REST OF IT THE UNDER UH THE UNDER SIDE UH OF IT
YEAH THE BACK SIDE AND THE LOWER PART OF THE FRONT IS OF COURSE TITANIUM MADE OF TITANIUM AND HAS THE TITANIUM COLOUR OF COURSE THE LOOK
UM THEN WE HAVE UH ON BACK ON THE FRONT UH THE LOGO IN THE UPPER CORNER
UH WHICH IS UH MADE UH WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THE BACK PART OF THE TITANIUM UH TITANIUM PART
YEAH
IT'S A DOUBLE R.
YEAH THE LOGO UH UH IT'S DIFFICULT TO DRAW SO SMALL BUT IT'S OUR DOUBLE R. UH LOGO IS IN THERE
UM SO THAT'S THE LOGO IN THE UPPER LEF UH RIGHT CORNER
THEN WE HAVE THE BUTTONS
UH IT'S DIFFICULT TO DRAW AGAIN THE LITTLE OVAL OR ROUND I THINK OVAL WILL BE BETTER FOR THE FOR THE D FOR THE DIFFERENT UH CHANNEL BUTTONS
SO UH OVAL N THOSE ARE HERE
AND THEN WE HAVE THE M
THE M
YEAH THE THE CON THE THE THE YEAH THE T VOLUME AND THE CHANNEL CONTROLS UH IN THE MIDDLE HERE
UM UM WITH KIND OF ARROW SHAPES WHICH MAKES IT ALSO A BIT MORE EXCITING THAN BASIC ROUND OR UM UH
UH SQUARE BUTTONS
AND ALSO HERE ARE THE TWO UH BUTTONS WE AGREED ON
WE HAVE THE OKAY BUTTON
OH NEI WE UH THE OKAY BUTTON'S HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OF THE OPERATORS OF THE CHANNEL AND UH VOLUME UM CHANGERS
AND THEN WE'VE HERE THE MENU BUTTON AND THE
AND THE VIDEO BUTTON
THE YEAH
AND OF COURSE THIS LOW PART THIS IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
UH THIS IS WHAT WE MADE OF IT
YOU CAN MAKE UH SUGGESTIONS UH IF YOU WANT
MAYBE WE MAYBE WE SHOULD FINISH FIRST UH OUR TALK AND THEN YOU CAN ADD SUGGESTIONS
MAYBE I I DON'T WANT TO I DON'T WANT TO SUPPRESS YOU BUT N I'LL UH FINISH THIS UH QUICK
UM OKAY I'VE HAD EVERYTHING I GUESS ON THE FRONT
YEAH THE BACK
YEAH
WE THOUGHT ABOUT YEAH UH THE BACK IS OF COURSE TOTALLY TITANIUM
AND WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE LOGO BIG IN THE MIDDLE
JUST SO AGAIN THE DOUBLE R.
WE HAVE THEN THE LOGO ON FRONT AND ON THE BACK
MAYBE THAT'S TOO MUCH BUT YOU HAVE TO SAY UH SAY THAT IF YOU THINK THAT WAY
AND THE COMPANY SLOGAN WE THOUGHT IN A KIND OF ARC SHAPE UH ABOVE THE LOGO
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT AND
OH AND UH BEFORE I FORGET
YEAH THE THE VOICE OF COURSE THE VOICE RECORDER IS UH AT THE BOTTOM
AND YOU CAN RECORD IT UH USING YEAH THE THE THE BACK OF THE F W DEVICE
WHY
WELL IT FITS UH IT IT IT IT FITS THE HAND MEAN UH THE THE THE THE
IN THE MIDDLE IN THE
THAT'S THE QUESTION
UH WELL YEAH
H WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I MEAN WE DO
THIS WAS MIKE'S PROTOTYPE AND Y YOU SEEMED TO AGREED ON IT
BUT NOW YOU HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
THE SIZE
YEAH WELL THE SIZE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER W I MEAN SIDE
UH OH THE SIDE
W WE WE HE DREW THE S THE SIDE BUT YOU D YOU WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION AS USUAL
WELL ANY CASE WE'LL DISCUSS IT NOW
UH I THINK UH THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD UH GOOD IDEA
BUT YOU YOU HOLD IT LIKE THIS
YOU'RE NOT HOLDING IT LIKE THIS OR SOMETHING
YOU YEAH Y HOW DO YOU CALL IT
YEAH
WELL Y Y Y YOU DON'T HAVE IT LIKE THIS
YOU HAVE IT MORE LIKE THIS
YOU YOU YOU'RE USING BUTTONS THIS WAY OR IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED THIS WAY
SO YOU YEAH
SO
YEAH WELL
AND MAYBE YOU CAN YOU CAN GRAB IT A BIT HIGHER SO WELL
WELL THE THE WELL THAT'S A REASON TO TO TO PUT THE L. C. D. SCREEN UH OF COURSE ON THE UPPER SIDE BUT
IF NECESSARY
BUT UH ARE D CAN YOU LIVE WITH IT
UH
Y YEAH Y Y Y Y YOU SAID IT WAS TOTALLY UH UNUSABLE
BUT DO YOU
BUT D YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE I GUESS
I THINK
NOT TOTALLY WELL
YEAH BUT OF COURSE Y YOU ARE ALSO HUMAN
WE HAVE TO TAKE UH EVERY EVERYONE INTO ACCOUNT
SO
YEAH
WELL UH WHO WHO ELSE THINKS LIKE YOU
WE DON'T KNOW
MAYBE A THOUSAND PEOPLE OR A MILLION PEOPLE
LET IT BE
ALRIGHT
SO THAT'S THAT
UH ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS
YOU'RE VERY PERSONAL AGAIN
WELL D WE DESIGNED IT SO OF COURSE WE ARE VERY
YEAH
SO AND WE HA WE HAVE ANSWER NOW
YEAH
I YEAH I THINK IT
WELL L WELL LET'S START WITH THE BEGINNING JUST ONE BY ONE
WELL I GUESS UH I THINK UH IT'S UH IT'S IT'S UM POINTED TOWARDS THE YOUTH OF COURSE
UH IF YOU LOOK AT THE DESIGN AND AND THE COLOURS AND EVERYTHING
THAT WAS OUR TARGET AUDIENCE OF COURSE
BUT IT'S ALSO NOT COMPLETELY UM
UH U UNACCEPTABLE FOR OLDER PEOPLE I GUESS
UH IT'S IT'S NOT F A DEVICE THAT
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S UH FOR OLDER PEOPLE IT'S IT'S MORE THAT CLASSICAL LOOK
SO
UH NO
I THINK YEAH THEY LIKE BLACK OF COURSE
BUT I THINK THEY'LL UH THEY THEY THINK UH THE THE TITANIUM LOOK OF IT IS ALSO UH I THINK IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR THEM
SO I THINK WE BOTH UH HAVE UH CONSIDER CONSIDERED UH THE YOUTH AND ALSO A BIT OLDER PEOPLE
SO I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD LOOKING AND NOT ONLY FOR YOUTH UH YOUNG PEOPLE
YEAH THE FOURTEEN YEAH
IS IT EASY TO T CHANGE CHANNELS
YEAH WELL I THINK SO
I THINK IT'S UH AS EASY AS UH CAN BE MADE
UH
SO I YEAH
YOU HOW CAN YOU MAKE IT ANY EASIER
YEAH HUGE IS A YEAH
D WE D WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE UH THAT S
YEAH
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE DEVICE THAT BEEPS UH WHEN YOU LOST IT OR SO BUT UM UM
YEAH
YEAH
MM
ARE WE TAKE TOO MUCH TIME
YEAH VERY MUCH
ONE
YEAH
AND I THINK FANCY FEELING TOO BECAUSE OF THE TITANIUM BACK
YEAH
SO WELL MAYBE TWO BECAUSE OF THE VOICE RECORDER
F
YEAH
ONE OR TWO
YEAH
FOUR
WELL IT DOESN'T REALLY RESEMBLE ANY FRUIT UH THAT'S TRUE
BUT BUT WE HAVE THE THE THE THE THE SPARKLY FRUITY COLOURS OF COURSE
AND YOU CAN ALSO HAVE FRONT WITH UH WITH FRUIT ON IT
I KNEW THINGS UH WERE GOING UH TOO SMOOTHLY
THERE HAD TO BE SOME KIND OF TROUBLE ALONG THE WAY
MY GOD
THE WHAT
THE
YEAH W THA THAT'S UH THAT'S A BIT AN OPTIONAL OPTION
NO
NO D TH NO
YEAH
NO
N
UH WELL WE HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM I THINK
BECAUSE UH
THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH
NO
BECAUSE UH THAT UH Y BECAUSE MY INFORMATION SAYS IT
HUH
UH WELL YEAH I I READ SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT
YEAH I I READ SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT IT WASN'T VERY CLEAR
I D I DIDN'T IN INCLUDE IT IN MY REPORT
SINGLE
WELL YOU HAVE TO USE
A CHIP
SO
WELL YOU HAVE TO USE THE ADVANCED CHIP IF YOU HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
BUT IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR CHIP YOU CAN'T HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
THAT THAT'S A FACT
UH
YEAH BUT IT'S ONLY ONE HALF
UH IT D IT DOESN'T
BUT WE D THEN WE HAVE TO LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH I KNOW BUT THAT'S WHAT MY INFORMATION SAYS
I DI I DIDN'T UH PUT UH THE ADVANCED CHIP IN THERE FOR FUN
YOU HAVE TO USE IT
FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH
YEAH
WELL UH AND WHAT DO THEY MEAN WITH CURVES UH AGAIN
BECAUSE WE YOU HAVE UNCURVED
YEAH
WELL
BUT WHAT WHAT DID WHAT DO N SORRY BUT WHAT DO THEY MEAN WITH THE CURVES
IS TH IS THIS A CURVE
ONE CURVE
YEAH THIS IS ACTUALLY TWO CURVES YEAH
IT'S HOW YOU IT'S HOW YOU LOOK AT IT
WELL THEN WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM I THINK
W T WE CAN NEVER GET UH BELOW THE TWELVE AND A HALF
BUT UH I
HEY BUT UH I THINK YOU'LL AGREE THAT UH THAT WE THAT NOW WE HAVE THIS UH SCREEN
IT'S IT'S VERY UH NOT PRACTICAL TO HA TO CONSIDER THIS AFTER WE HAVE DESIGNED THE ENTIRE THING
WELL THAT'S PRETTY UH L
N NOT VERY PRACTICAL
WELL
BUT I'M N I DON'T AGREE
I THINK
I THINK THE TITANIUM JUST UH PROVIDED THE THE TOUGH LOOK AND THE AND THE
AND ALSO THE THE OLDER PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND BECAUSE I ALRIGHT IT'S NOT OUR TARGET AUDIENCE BUT IT'S IT'S USEFUL IF IT'S UH IMPORTANT FOR OLD PEOPLE
YEAH
I THINK THE TITANIUM IS VERY IMPORTANT
YEAH WE HAVE A PROBLEM YEAH
W BUT YOU CAN BETTER YEAH DUMP THE L. C. D. SCREEN THEN
WELL WHAT ELSE
W I MEAN UH
YEAH
YEAH WELL YEAH
ALRIGHT
I AGREE WITH THAT
SO WE U WE USE UH
UNFORTUNATELY
UM
TITANIUM COLOURED PLASTIC
SO TITANIUM COLOURED PLASTIC FOR THE BACK
YEAH THIS IS GOOD BUT IT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
SO WE HAVE TO USE THE DITCH THE TITANIUM I'M AFRAID
WHAT DO WE WELL WHAT DO WE KNOW
ALL WE WANT IS A IS A FANCY DESIGN BUT WE DON'T REALLY CONSIDER THE COSTS
SO
YEAH AL ALRIGHT YEAH
BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT NOW
SO
SO
TITANIUM GONE AND ADD PLASTIC
AND ON PLASTIC TIMES TWO AND THEN WE UH ARE THERE
NO
NO YEAH WELL OH SIX
A LOT OF PLASTIC YEAH
NO TWO FOR THE TO MAKE IT CLEAR
I WANT GOLD PLATING
NO NO UM
WE HAVE WE HAVE TO UH FILL
W WE HA NO NO NO BUT TH THAT'S NOT F UM
WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN DOUBLE CURVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TITANIUM
AND THAT WE DROPPED SO IT IT CAN BE DONE
BUT IT'S PRETTY FUNNY
WE WE DO WANT TO REACH
TWELVE POINT FIVE
BUT IT ISN'T BAD TO TO TO STAY AT ELEVEN
WE GET MORE SALARY IF WE MAKE IF CHEAPER THAN TWELVE UH TWELVE AND A HALF
OBJECTION
WELL I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION BUT UH I THINK IT'S UH WELL IN IN IF WE CONSIDER THE COSTS THEN THIS IS THE BEST YEAH
ITS IT'S UH RIDICULOUS ACTUALLY BUT
WHICH ISN'T VERY PRACTICAL BUT THAT'S THE WAY
UH-HUH
WELL UH THEY THEY DIDN'T THINK OF THE REQUIREMENTS
IT'S THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE USER UH I GUESS
YEAH
YEAH BUT THEY BASE THAT ON ON THE USER SPECIFICATIONS
IT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER
NO UH IT IT IT UH IT IS UH
NO IT'S OTHER WAY AROUND
THAT'S THE SMARTBOARD
THAT'S THE DIGITAL PANEL
THAT'S THAT'S THE SMART
A TELEVI YEAH
YEAH
LEFT OR RIGHT
WELL I DIDN'T USE UH
NEI IT IT'S MUCH M
BUT UH YOU CAN UH I I SENT IT ABOUT THREE TIMES NOW
UH A GREEN UH BOARD WITH UH CHALK IS MUCH MORE USEFUL THAN THAT THING
THE SIMPLE UH SCH SCHOOL BOARD
I I DIDN'T USE IT
I WROTE THINGS DOWN BUT I DIDN'T IMPORT IT INTO MY LAPTOP
THAT'S THE
W BUT ALSO Y YOU WRITE THINGS DOWN
AND I YOU CAN ALSO BRING YOUR YOUR YOUR NOTE BLOCK
SO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE TH WHAT'S THE POINT OF IMPORTING IT INTO
YEAH ALRIGHT
FOR DRAWINGS BUT NOT FOR PERSONAL NOTES
I THINK THAT'S NOT VERY
UH I MEAN YOU CAN BRING YOUR PAPERWORK ALONG AND P WELL OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PAPER IF YOU'VE IF YOU'VE
YEAH I UNDERSTAND
BUT I THINK UH D THIS OPTION IS ONLY USEFUL IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERWORK
YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT VERY UH NI YEAH WELL A LOT OF DOCUMENTS ARE YEAH
MU YEAH RIGHT
CAN WE KEEP THEM
UH
WELL DID YOU REALLY UH
DID YOU REALLY TAKE UH TAKE THOSE IN ACCOUNT
I HALF OF TIME I DIDN'T NOTICE THEY WERE THERE
SO
BUT WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT
BECAUSE THIS IS A REALISTIC ENVIRONMENT
RIGHT
OKAY
BUT YEAH
W WELL TH THAT'S JUST THE THE ENVIRONMENT THEY SET US UP F WITH
SO
WELL FOR DRAWING FOR DRAWINGS
YEAH
WELL
NO
BUT IT'S STILL AN EXPENSIVE UH EXPENSIVE
BUT IF W YEAH
WELL AND IF
AND BUT WHAT IF UH MAYBE THIS THIS BOARD UH SMARTBOARD IS MALFUNCTIONING OR SOMEONE
BUT SUPPOSE IT WAS WORKING CORRECTLY WHAT UH WOULD IT BE USEFUL THEN IF IT WASN'T OFF ALL THE TIME
A
REALLY
ANYTHING YOU WANT
ANY B B YEAH
L LI LI
YEAH
WELL IT ISN'T BUT MAYBE THAT THING IS UH IS
YEAH BOARD A SCHOOL BOARD YEAH
YEAH
I IT HAS IT IS USEFUL
YEAH
THIS UH IF IT WORKS CORRECT MAYBE THIS THING THIS THING IS JUST MALFUNCTIONING
SO UH IF WE GET IN UH IF WE GET ANOTHER ONE AND YOU MAKE SURE IT DOES WORK I THINK THEN IT'S PRETTY USEFUL
BECAUSE UH YEAH YOU CAN DRAW T THINGS QUICKLY AND UH CLEARLY FOR ANYONE UH IN THE DISCUSSION ROOM
AND THEN YOU CAN SAVE IT IMMEDIATELY
DID YOU TYPE THAT
MAYBE TILL FOUR O'CLOCK OR SOMETHING
WELL DUNNO
YEAH
NO WE MUST SAVE THIS THING YEAH
IN THE SHARED MAP MAP
MAP IS IT A GOOD WORD
THE FOLDER YEAH
SO IT IS USEFUL YEAH
NO BUT UH
RADICAL
YEAH
DO YOU BELIEVE IT YOURSELF
THEY ALSO WANT TO SEE MY CAT AND HIS RABBIT AND UH
YOUR BIG BEAUTIFUL BIRD
MAYBE THE PEN IS JUST UH UH BROKEN AND THE BOARD ISN'T
OF OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND UH
YEAH I THINK SO TOO
WHO IS SHE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

YEAH I LIKE THAT
BLAME OUR ACCOUNTANTS
BUT WE COULDN'T YEAH
WELL I TH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
MM RIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH I AGREE
IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE
IF IT'S KINDA SMALL THIS IS IS GREAT
BUT IF IT'S IT'S LARGER THEN YOU WANT TO GRAB IT
YEAH THAT'S THE QUESTION
YEAH I AGREE WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR PALM LIKE THIS AND YOU CAN WATCH UH WATCH THE SCREEN
AND IF YOU HAVE IT LI IN THE MIDDLE YOUR HAND MIGHT BE OVER IT
LIKE YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR TELEPHONE
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A SCREEN ON IT YOU WANNA LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN
YEAH I AGREE ON THIS
NO I DON'T THINK SO
THAT'S NOT UH THE POINT
AND YOU MIGHT BE UH YOU MIGHT BE TARGET CUSTOMER
YEAH
ALRIGHT
GREAT
WELL THIS IS JUST A SHORT INTRO
I'M GOING TO DO UH THE EV EVALUATION
THAT'S GONNA BE DONE AT THE END OF SEVEN POINT SKILL CRITERIA
SO I MADE A I MADE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THE HAND OF UH UH THE IMPOR MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS AND TRENDS
AND WE HAVE TO LOOK IF OUR UH IF OUR DEVICE UH IS WORKING CORRECTLY
WELL I PUT SOME QUESTIONS IN A WORD FILE
SEE IF I CAN FIND THEM
UH UH UH UH MM
WELL
I UH THINK YOU HAVE ALL SEEN UH THIS KIND OF EVALUATION SO UH I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT
UH THE FIRST QUESTION IS UH IS THE DEVICE GOOD LOOKING
BECAUSE NORMAL P UH MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT UM EARLIER DEVICES WERE UGLY UGLY
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM
SO WHAT DO WE THINK
YEAH
NO I KNOW BUT I HAVE TO UH EVALUATE IT
SO I HAVE TO TAKE THIS QUESTIONNAIRE
YEAH
YEAH BUT I CAN'T CAN S
YEAH BUT UH YOU KNOW
WE DIS WE DI WE DESIGNED IT TO BE PERFECT
SO BUT WE HAVE TO BE CRITIC CRITICAL ABOUT IT
AND I HAVE TO UH TAKE ALL THESE POINTS AND GET A AVERAGE AT THE END
SO WE WE KNOW WHERE WE STAND
'CAUSE TH THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE MIGHT HAVE UH BI MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN
RIGHT SO
RIGHT
UH IS IT GOOD LOOKING
THE TITANIUM MIGHT BE UH F
FOR OLDER PEOPLE
IT YOU PUT UH PUT A BLACK FRONT ON IT OR SOMETHING
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT A NUMBER PLEASE
SO THE LAST ONE IS SEVEN
EASY TO CHANGE CHANNELS
OH SORRY

BECAUSE WE WE USE A BRAND AT THE FRONT AND UH I DUN AT THE BACK
IF YOU HAVE UH LOTS OF UH MARKETING

OH THAT'S JUST GREAT
OH ALRIGHT
THAT IS PRETTY STUPID
Y
YEAH I AGREE
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD DUMP THE L. C. D. SCREEN
OR YOU SHOU IT'S OR CHANGE THE TITANIUM OR DUMP THE L. C. D. SCREEN
BUT I THINK YOU COULD BETTER CHANGE UH TITANIUM TO HARD A HARD KIND OF PLASTIC LOOKING LIKE TITANIUM THAN LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
BECAUSE YOU HAVE LOTS OF FUNCTIONS IN IT TOO
YEAH I AGREE
OSL
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
SO S IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOU CAN'T MAKE IT

SO
F FIRST
IS THIS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE THAT UH BIG BUTTONS
POSITIVE
OKAY
WHAT ARE YOUR EXPERIENCES
MM
SO AND DO THEY ALWAYS HAVE THAT
IT'S EASY TO YOU
OKAY
'KAY
OKAY SO THEY HAVE TOO MUCH
SO NEXT
FOR OUR OWN REMOTE CONTROL WE HAVE TO THINK HOW DO WE MAKE IT
SO WHAT IDEAS DO YOU HAVE FOR IT FOR THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL
WHAT WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE
NOT TOO HEAVY
YES
YEAH
YES
LIKE A PHONE
OKAY
SO THAT'S
OKAY
YES
OKAY
THIS IS IT HAS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER THINGS
OKAY
YES
NO BATTERY USE
SO MORE IDEAS
NO OKAY
IT'S ONLY THE FIRST IDEAS
SO UH WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW IS NEXT MEETING IS IN HALF AN H HOUR
UH
OKAY
NEXT MEETING HALF AN HOUR
UM WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
WELL LOOK ON YOUR
AND
NEXT INSTRUCTIONS YOU'LL GET IN YOUR EMAIL
SO
THIS IS THE FIRST MEETING
SEE YOU LATER IN HALF AN HOUR
HMM
THAT'S UH STRANGE
YEAH
OKAY
LET'S TRY THIS
UH
UM
MM-HMM
MM
UH
NO NO
YEAH
OKAY
UH BLANK
NO
UH WELL I THINK THE THE THE GOAL OF A REMOTE CONTROL IS THAT IT'S IT IT HAS AN INFLUENCE ON THE T. V. SET
AND THAT IT CONTROLS THE CHANNELS AND THE THE VOLUME
AND UH I I I THINK IT'S POSITIVE IF THERE'S A A LED UH UH A LED ON THE CORNER OF THE OF THE REMOTE
SO THAT YOU KNOW IT S IT STILL HAS BATTERIES ON IT IN IT
AND THAT IF YOU PUSH THE BUTTON THE LED UH GIVES A LIGHT AND UH AND YOU SEE THAT IT'S WORKING
AND UH YEAH
UH
YEAH BUT
NO NO NO
BUT I MY MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT IT IT'S CONVENIENT TO HAVE THAT
YEAH
YEAH
HMM
YEAH
YEAH WELL THAT'S THAT ARE GOOD IDEAS
UH
YEAH WELL THE LED ON THE CORNER THAT THAT INDICATES THAT IT'S WORKING
IF YOU PUSH A BUTTON
UM
YEAH
AND LOOKING ON THE BUDGET NOT TOO EXPENSIVE UH MATERIAL
SO PROBABLY PLASTIC OR SOMETHING
UH
MM NO
YES
NICE
AN ELEPHANT
'KAY
POP UPS
WHAT IS THIS PICTIONARY
UH A BIRD
BIRD
YEAH
WHOO
OH NOT
OH
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
NO PROBLEM
SHIT HAPPENS
A PARROT
ISH
HE DID IT BEFORE
OH
THANK YOU
UH I WILL START
UH BIG ONE THEY ARE UH NOT EASY TO USE
UM I HAVE ONE SET AND UH A REMOTE CONTROL WHEN I DROPPED IT UH IT BROKE
SO THAT WON'T BE UH OUR GOAL I THINK
AND UH G BIG BUTTONS M UH THAT'S EASIER TO USE THAN UH I THINK
NOT ALL THE SMALL BUTTONS YOU DON'T KNOW
BIG BUTTONS POSITIVE
ALL ALL SMALL BUTTONS LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE UH LIKE A HUNDRED BUTTONS ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WORKING FOR
THANK YOU
HELP ALSO
THANK YOU
THE WEIGHT
NOT NOT TOO HEAVY
NOT MUCH BUTTONS
BUST FREE
THAT WHEN YOU DROP IT IT WON'T BREAK
LIKE UH SOME KIND OF RUBBER ON IT
OR HARD UH HARD PLASTIC
UH BUTTONS NOT TOO SMALL
UH SOMETHING LIKE WHEN YOU UH LOSE YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROL SOMETIMES IT HAPPEN
UH IT BETWEEN THE COUCH AND YOU CAN'T FIND IT
WHEN YOU PUSH A BUT A BUTTON ON THE T. V. THEN YOU HEAR SOME UH SOME SORT OF BLEEP
AND THEN YOU UH HEY THERE THERE'S REMOTE CONTROL
NEXT
I HAVE ONE MORE IDEA
JUST POPPED UP
UH IT IT WON'T TAKE A LOT OF BATTERIES
SO YOU DON'T WON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE BATTERIES UH ONCE A WEEK OR UH ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS
OKAY
THANK YOU
YEP
OKAY
OH
WELL WE WILL TRY
WHERE IT GOING
HMM
UH
MM
SO
NOW SAVE
NOW UH BLANK
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING UH ON MY SCREEN NOW
OKAY
WOW
OH
NICE
UH AT HOME WE HAVE A T. V. A VIDEO UH RECORDER A D. V. D. PLAYER AND A SATELLITE RECEIVER
WE HAVE UH FOUR DISTINCTIVE REMOTE CONTROLS FOR THAT
THAT'S NOT REALLY EA EASY
SO IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE HAVE ONE FOR ALL
AND WE ALSO HAD A REMOTE CONTROL FOR OUR RADIO SET
BUT UM I IT IT HAD A LOT OF BUTTONS ON IT AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHICH ONE WAS WHAT
AND IT WAS UH UH V NOT EASY TO USE
SO WE N BARELY USED IT
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT UH FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW IT ALSO HAS TO LOOK NICE
OR YOU WON'T SELL IT
AND UM YEAH UH ON OUR WEBSITE WE CAN SEE WHAT PRODUCTS WE ALREADY HAVE
AND IT SHOULD WORK WITH AS MANY UH AS POSSIBLE OF THEM
YES
OKAY
OKAY
SO WELCOME BACK
WHAT DO DO WE HAVE TO DO
SO FIRST
I WANT TO SAY I'M THE SECRETARY SO I MAKE THE MINUTES
YOU FIND THEM IN YOUR IN THE MAP IN THE
FROM THE GROUP
THERE'S THE MINUTES FROM THE FIRST MEETING
YOU'LL FIND THE NEXT MINUTES ALSO THERE
THEN
I WANNA HEAR FROM YOU WHAT YOU'VE DONE
AND AFTER THAT I HAVE SOME NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
SO AND AFTER THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS WHAT WE WILL DO
AND THEN WE'RE READY
WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES FOR THIS MEETING
AFTER THAT WE'LL HAVE LUNCH
SO FIRST I WANNA ASK THE
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TO TELL WHAT HE DID
SO
YEAH ON YOUR COMPUTER OR THE
WHAT'S THE NAME
WHAT'S THE NAME OF IT
IT'S THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION OR THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
WORKING DESIGN
WORKING DESIGN
WHAT IS THIS
PRODUCT DOCUMENTS
ON THE DESKTOP
UP
UP
UP
UP
UP
YES
MY DOCUMENTS
NOPE
GONE
WELL YOU UM NAH
NAH NAH NAH
POWERPOINT
WORKING DESIGN
AND
PRESENTATION
OF WORKING DESIGN
SAVE AS
UH IT'S
PROJECT
SAVE
VERY GOOD
OKAY
SO
NOW HAVE TEN MINUTES TO TELL IT
OKAY
OH OH
TWO QUESTIONS
THE BATTERY
YOU SAY ONE BATTERY IS CHEAPER
WHY
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU USE TWO YOU CAN USE IT TWO TIMES LONGER
OKAY SO IT'S THE SIZE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY AND THE BUTTONS
WHEN YOU USE IT ON THE TELEVISION YOU'VE YOU NEED THE TELEVISION WH WHICH CAN USE IT
S
OKAY
I THINK WE HAVE TO USE IT ALSO ON OTHER TELEVISIONS THOUGH
SO
YEAH BUT I DON'T I THINK IT THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THOUGH
WE HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE
IT HAS TO WORK ON O UH ALL TELEVISIONS
OKAY
YEAH
GOOD IDEA
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT THERE ARE MUCH MORE NOKIA TELEPHONES THAN UM THESE ONES
YEAH BUT ARE THEIR
PROFITS BIGGER THAN THEIR COST
YEAH BUT THERE ARE ALSO DESIGN COST
I DON'T THINK WHEN YOU HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL DO YOU CHANGE THE COVER
WOULD YOU CHANGE THE COVER
NO
N YEAH BUT
I THINK THAT TOO LESS PEOPLE WOULD CHANGE IT FOR GOOD PROFIT
SO
YES IT IS BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT
OKAY
THAT'S CLEAR
OKAY THANK YOU
SO NOW THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
WE'LL GOT BACK ON THAT LATER
'KAY THANK YOU
THEN IT'S YOUR TURN THE MARKETING EXPERT
OKAY THANK YOU
YES
I THINK UH THE L. C. D. IS CHEAPER THAN SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO I THINK THAT CAN BE AN D GOOD OPTION
L. C. D.
YES
ONLY THE L. C. D.
SO BUT WE'LL COME BACK ON THAT
NOW
OH GO ON
WHAT D D D UM
UM
UH WE GO BACK ON THE DECISIONS LATER
NOW WE HAVE A FEW NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
FIRST TELETEXT
WE HAVE INTERNET NOW SO WE DON'T NEED THE TELETEXT ANYMORE
SO
NOT NECESSARY
NEXT
ONLY FOR THE TELEVISION
SO WE DON'T LOOK AT THE OTHER THINGS LIKE THE RADIO OR SOMETHING
ONLY THE TELEVISION
THIRD
WE LOOK AT THE AGE GROUP OF FORTY PLUS
UH NO YOUNGER THAN FORTY
IS A G BIG GROUP AND LIKE YOU SHOWED N NOT VERY MUCH PEOPLE BUY OUR STUFF
FOURTH POINT
OUR CORPORATE COLOUR AND SLOGAN MUST BE USED
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE DESIGN
SO YOU CAN SEE IT ON OUR SITE
NEXT
UM NO
WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR DECISIONS WHAT WE WANT TO DO
SO LIKE
YOU SAID WE NEED THE
MAYBE IT'S GOOD TO PUT IT IN A DOCUMENT
NOW WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT CONTROLS DO WE NEED
SO MAYBE YOU CAN TELL US
SORRY
YES
YES IT'S OKAY
YEAH BUT WE DON'T USE IT
IT'S A NEW REQUIREMENT
SO IT'S NOT MY REQUIREMENT
WE HAVE TO DO THIS
NO
SO
WHAT CONTROLS DO WE NEED
WHO FIRST
OKAY
UH POWER
UH MM CHANNEL
CHANNEL
ZERO TO NINE
VOLUME
MAYBE IT'S EASY TO PICK
WHAT WAS W YOUR ONE
TECHNO
OKAY
WE HAD W UH NO NO NO NO
WHERE WAS THAT EXAMPLE OF THE
JOHAN
THAT WAS THE THE THE THE THE TECHNICAL
HALLO
OKAY
WHAT DO WE NEED
ON OFF
ZERO TO NINE
YEAH THAT'S THE CHANNEL
MENU
UH YES THE N NEWER TELEVISIONS HA DO HAVE MENUS
UH
M MENU
I THINK UM
THE
ONLY ONE OR
TWO NUMBERS
AND
HELLO
THAT'S CH
YES
ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YOU MEAN
THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE IT ON THE REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT IT HAS TO WORK ON ALL TELEVISIONS
SO
WE NEED
N YES
BUT IF WE
HAVE THIS
SO NOW WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS
IS THIS ENOUGH
MUTE
MAYBE IN THE MENU
MUTE
MM-HMM
OKAY
MAYBE MORE
NO
WELL
THEN THAT'S ALL
THIS WILL BE THE BUTTONS
AND
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THE NEXT PHASE
SO WE CAN GO ON TO
YES
NO THAT'S FOR THE NEXT PHASE
UM
PHASE TWO IS THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
SO THEN WE'LL HAVE THE CONCEPTS
THAT'S FOR THE SO UH NEXT POINT
NOW WE HAVE LUNCH BREAK
AFTER THAT WE HAVE T THIRTY MINUTES FOR WORK
AND YOU CAN FIND THE MINUTES IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER INCLUSIVE THE UH BUTTONS
NO
YOUR INDIVIDUAL ACTION YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THE EMAIL
SO NOW IT'S TIME FOR LUNCH
THANKS FOR COMING
MM-HMM
MM
YEAH IT'S A GOOD IDEA
BUT
IF IF IT YEAH I DON'T I'M NOT SURE IF IT WILL MAKE PROFIT ENOUGH TO UH BUT IT'S UH YEAH IT'S UH ORIGINAL IDEA
NO
OH
THAT'S ME
UH
COME ON
AH
YES WELL UH UH I SHALL GIVE A SHORT TALK ABOUT THE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN
UM I THOUGHT THE THE THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION DESIGN WAS UH TO UH FOR A REMOTE CONTROL TO TO TO HAVE SOME INFLUENCE ON THE T. V. SET
UH BOTH AUDIO AND VIDE VIDEO UH IN A CORDLESS WAY
NO CORDS ATTACHED
AND UH WELL IT ALL BY PUSHING A BUTTON ON THE REMOTE
THAT WAS FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND UH AND UH THE PREVIOUS MEETING
UH I FIND SOME UH SOME INTERESTING QUOTES ON THE WEB
UH WELL THE SAME IDEA HERE
UH MESSAGE TO THE TELEVISION
AND UH AND AND AND WELL BASIC UH OPERATIONS LIKE ON AND OFF AND UH SWITCHING CHANNELS AND UH AND MAYBE UH TELETEXT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH WELL THESE ARE TWO UH REMOTES AND THAT'S OUR UH OUR DILEMMA I THINK
UH
WE JUST HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER HOW UH DIFFICULT IT IS
BUT UH SHALL WE MAKE A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL UH JUST UH SWAPPING CHANNELS AND VOLUME AND UH POWER BUTTON AND WELL NOTHING MUCH MORE
OR UH UH MORE FUNCTIONS ON THE REMOTE
UH MAYBE MORE DEVICES YOU CAN INFLUENCE
UH A RADIO OR A V A VIDEO RECORDER UH V. C. R.
YEAH WELL THAT'S OUR DILEMMA
UM ANY IDEAS ABOUT THAT
BASIC OR MULTIFUNCTIONAL
OKAY YEAH
YEAH WELL THE THAT WAS JUST ON MY MIND
SO UH I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT UH
WHAT WAY WE WOULD GO
MM YEAH WELL THAT WAS MY UH FUNCTIONAL UH TALK
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
NO
AND I DON'T UH I DON'T THINK TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR A REMOTE IS REALLY CHEAP OR SOMETHING
SO IT'S
YEAH IT'S HARD TO UH
GET THE YOUNGER
GROUP
MM-HMM
JUST THE L. C. D.
MM-HMM
WELL A POWER BUTTON
UH THE WELL UM I THINK SEPARATE CHANNELS
SO
BUT THEN BOTH THE THE SEPARATE CHANNELS
SO SO UH ZERO TO NINE OR SOMETHING
UH VOLUME
OH MINE
TECHNICAL
MM YES
MUTE
UM
YEAH BUT THEN IT'S ALWAYS UH MORE THAN ONE UH
THING TO DO
THAT'S MY TASK
OKAY
UH I'VE
WHERE HAVE I PUT IT
MY DOCUMENTS OR NOT
HMM
I'VE SAVE IT ON MY COMPUTER MY PRESENTATION
BUT WHERE
UH UH UH
IT WAS ABOUT THE WORKING OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
NOPE
NOT A OF
WAIT
THE WORKING DESIGN
BUT I'VE SAVED IT
BUT NOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS
HMM
YEAH
AND I IMPORT THIS UNTIL
ONE MORE
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
YEAH THAT'S THE EMPTY ONE
I HAD ONE
UH-HUH
OPEN IT
OKAY HERE IT IS
PROJECT
OKAY
A LITTLE LATER BUT HERE IT IS
SO OKAY
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT WHAT I'M GONNA TELL YOU
IT'S ABOUT THE WORKING OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
I JUST HAD AN HALF AN HOUR J TO STUDY IT AND I DON'T GET IT
TEN MINUTES TO TELL IT
OKAY
I THINK IT WILL BE A FEW MINUTES AND FIRST UH I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE FINDINGS WHAT I DISCOVERED ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROL
THE WORKING BOUT IT UH OF IT
UH THEN I'LL HAVE UH SOME KIND OF MAP AND IT'S THE TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SCIENCE UH YOU I WILL SHOW THAT UH IN IN A FEW MINUTES
AND THEN UH WHAT I'LL THINK ABOUT IT
FIRST THE FINDINGS
THE REMOTE CONTROL IS A VERY DIFFICULT UH THING TO UH TO EXPLAIN TO JUST ALL OF YOU WH WHO HAVEN'T SEEN A REMOTE CONTROL UH INSIDE
UH THERE'S A LOT OF UH PLASTIC ON IT UM BECAUSE ITS UH NOT SO EXPENSIVE
AND THERE ARE UH A LOT OF UH WIRES UH WHICH UM CONNECT THE COMPONENTS IN IT
THE BATTERY AND THERE ARE UM SWITCHES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
THERE'S A LOT OF SMALL UH ELECTRONICS
SO IT WON'T BE UM UH TOO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD IT
ONLY TWELVE EURO FIFTY I THINK UH WE WILL MAKE IT
NOW AND HERE I HAVE THE TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
UH HERE'S SOME KIND OF CHIP
UH ON TOP OF THIS THERE ARE UH THE NUMBERS
UH YOU HAVE ALL ON YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
AND UH THE TELETEXT UH BUTTON
AND UH HERE'S THE BATTERY
AND WHEN YOU PUSH THE BUTTON IT WILL UH WILL BE SENT TO THE CHIP
AND THE CHIP WILL UM SEND IT TO ALL KIND OF SUB COMPONENTS
THAT'S WHAT I SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
AND AFTER THAT IT WILL BE SENT TO THE INFRARED
AND THAT WILL SEND IT TO YOUR TELEVISION
THAT'S A SHORT H UH HOW IT WORKS
UH I THINK I CAN UH MAKE IT UH DIFFICULT BUT WE ALL
WE ALL DON'T GET IT
MY PREFERENCES
IT'S UH IT WON'T BE UH WE SHOULDN'T MAKE IT TOO BIG
UH ALSO FOR THE COST UH WE SHOULD ONLY PUT ONE BATTERY ON IT
A LONG LASTING BATTERY
UH ALSO FOR THE COST UH USE ONLY PLASTIC
NOT OTHER MATERIALS
ALSO BECAUSE OF THE COST UH NOT TOO MUCH BUTTONS ON IT
WE CAN ALSO MAKE UH A BUTTON UH WITH A MENU UH BUTTON
AND THEN UM THAT THAT YOU WILL SEE IT ON THE T. V.
AND ON THE T. V. YOU CAN UH SWITCH INTO THE MENU
THAT'S I THINK IT'S EASIER
AND THE BLEEP SIGNAL Y UH YOU TOLD US
UH BUT WE CAN ALSO USE IT UH A BLEEP LIKE SOMETHING WHEN THE BATTERY'S EMPTY THEN THERE IS A BLEEP
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO CHANGE IT IN A IN A WEEK OR SOMETHING
AND ALSO THE BLEEP WHEN WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT UH WHEN YOU LOST IT
AND YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND THEN YOU HEAR BLEEP BLEEP AND WE WILL FIND IT
THIS IS UH JUST UH YEAH
YEAH
IF WE W IF WE USE ONLY JUST ONE UH SMALL PEN LIGHT THEN IT WILL BE CHEAPER THAN WHEN WE USE TWO
YEAH BUT THEN WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE THE UM REMOTE CONTROL UH LONG LASTING
JUST
YEAH
YEAH
BUT UH I THINK THIS OUR REMOTE CONTROL IS FOR THE TELEVISIONS WE UH WE SELL IN OUR COMPANY
OR IS IT ALSO FOR OTHER COMPANY UH FOR OTHER TELEVISIONS
THEN THIS IS AN OPTION
MAYBE JUST A MENU BUTTON TO USE IT ON OUR TELEVISIONS
AND THEN WE MAKE IT EASIER UH FOR OUR TELEVISIONS
AND ON THE OTHER TELE TELEVISIONS YOU CAN ALSO USE IT BUT THEN WE WON'T USE THE
YEAH
OKAY
THEN I THINK UH THE MENU BUTTON UH WILL ONLY WORK ON THE NEWER TELEVISIONS
AND WE WILL UH LOOK FORWARD AND DON'T MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH FOR THE OLDER TELEVISIONS
AND I JUST UH HAVE ONE MORE IDEA
UH MAYBE IT'S ONE OF YOUR TASKS
BUT UH TO HAVE A TRENDY REMOTE CONTROL WE CAN ALSO UM MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THE NOKIA UM MOBILE PHONES
TO CHANGE COVERS
SO IF YOU HAVE UH A TRENDY HALF WITH ALL RED UH YELLOW AND SOMETHING
AND THEN YOU CAN PUT A RED COVER ON IT
AND ALSO DIFFERENT THINGS
YES
UH THEN IT WON'T BE UH WILL HAVE JUST ONE COVER ON THE UH ORIGINAL ONE
AND THEN YOU CAN BUY THE COVERS
I THINK IT WILL BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT BUT NOT TOO MUCH
JUST LIKE WITH THE NOKIA UH MOBILE PHONES
JUST ONE
YEAH BUT THEN WE'LL HAVE TO TO JUST UM PUT FIVE COVERS ON IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS
IF IT WON'T WORKS THEN WE'LL GET SOMETHING ELSE
THEN WE UH WON'T G UH GO FURTHER WITH IT
UH A P A A COVER MADE IN UH IN CHINA IT IT WON'T BE I GUESS SO EXPENSIVE I THINK
MAYBE
I WI I WON'T
BUT MAYBE I THINK TRENDY PEOPLE OR LIKE CHILDREN WHERE YOU CAN PAINT ON IT
AND UH THE THE CHILDREN THINK OH THIS IS MY REMOTE CONTROL UH I MADE A PICTURE ON IT
UH
YEAH
OKAY
AND THE OTHER PEOPLE
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT
OKAY
OKAY
YOU'RE THE PROJECT MANAGER
YES
THAT'S IT
'KAY
YEAH
I HAVE UH ONE QUESTION
IF WE AIM FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE UM AND THERE WILL BE UH A LOT OF FEATURES LIKE L. C. D. OR THE THE THE SPEECH UH F RECOGNISING
UH THE COST WILL BE A LOT OF H UH A LOT HIGHER
UH I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN OUR BUDGET
DO YOU THINK
LIKE
NO
NO
UH-HUH
'KAY WE'LL JUST HAVE TO DO THAT
OKAY
NO DISCUSSION ABOUT IT
OKAY
UNFORTUNATELY
TO CHANGE TO THE NEXT CHANNEL JUST ONE BUTTON
TO MOVE UP MOVE DOWN
BUT THEN WE COME TO THE COSTS
BUT NOW WE HAVE ONLY THE BUTTONS
AND UH WE DON'T YET HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK LIKE
OR
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
DESKTOP
YEAH
OKAY
WELL
MAKE IT
HMM
HMM
WILL THIS WILL THIS ADD TO THE COST
YES BUT YOU HAVE TO M UH BE ABLE TO CHANGE IT
D DOES IT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DESIGN
NOT MUCH
'KAY
UM
MM
YEAH
YES
OKAY
UH UM M
YEAH
UM YEAH OKAY
THIS BIT TOO FAR
SO
SO I'M UH GONNA HAVE A PRESENTATION ABOUT UM THE MARKET ABOUT UM YEAH WHAT PEOPLE THINK
UH WE DID A USABILITY LAB TEST WITH A HUNDRED PERSONS
AND WE LOOKED AT UH SEVERAL UM THINGS
UH AMONG THEM DESIGN UH D D HOW D DID THEY LIKE THE USE OF IT UH WHAT FRUSTRATIONS THEY HAD WHILE USING REMOTE CONTROLS
UH WELL WHAT WHAT WILL BE OUR MARKET
AND UH WE ASKED THEM IF WE HAD SOME NEW FEATU FEATURES
IF UM THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA OR NOT
WELL OUR FINDINGS
UH OUR USERS THEY DISLIKED THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
UM UH THEY ESPECIALLY FOUND FOUND THEM VERY UGLY
AND UM TH THEY ALSO FOUND THEM HARD TO TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT
UH WELL THEY ALSO ZAP A LOT
SO UH ZAPPING UH SHOULD BE VERY EASY
AND UH FIFTY PERCENT OF THE USERS ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
SO A LOT OF UNUSED BUTTONS
THERE IS MORE FINDINGS
UH ON THE BUTTONS
WHICH UH BUTTONS FIND USERS UH VERY IMPORTANT AND WHICH WHICH NOT
AND HOW MUCH WOULD THEY USE THEM
WELL UH THE MOST USED BUTTON IS THE CHANNEL SELECTION
AND UH WE ASKED THEM HOW UH RELEVANT THEY THINK UH THE BUTTONS ARE
THE POWER VOLUME AND CHANNEL SELECTIONS ARE VERY RELEVANT
UH TELETEXT IS UH LESS RELEVANT BUT ALSO IMPORTANT
UH NOT IMPORTANT THEY FOUND THE AUDIO UH THAT'S NOT THE VOLUME BUT UH SPECIFIC THE THE PITCH OR THE LEFT OR RIGHT
UH THE SCREEN AND THE BRIGHTNESS
AND UH CHANNEL SETTINGS
UH TH AND THEY ALSO ARE NOT USED VERY OFTEN
THEN WE HAVE A FEW UM GRAPHS ABOUT THE MARKET
UH HERE WE CAN SEE WHAT THE MARKET SHARE IS OF UH SEVERAL GROUPS
UM AS YOU CAN SEE MOST USERS ARE UH BETWEEN THIRTY SIX AND FORTY FIVE
UM THE THE THE YOUNGER GROUP BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE IS NOT VERY BIG
AND TO COME BACK ON THE THE SWAPPING UH THINGS UH I DON'T THINK UH I I THINK THE YOUNGER WILL BE MOST INTEREST IN IT
BUT UH THEY ARE NOT A VERY BIG GROUP
UM IN THE WE ASKED THEM UH HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A S A NEW FEATURE
IF YOU HAVE AN L. C. D. ON THE REMOTE CONTROL WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF IT
NOW YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE YOUNG USERS SAY
I WILL THAT WOULD VERY NICE
AND OLDER USER THINK UH THEY WILL BE SCARED OF CHANGE I THINK
AND THEY WON'T LIKE IT
AND ANOTHER THING HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SPEECH RECOGNITION ON IT
WELL HERE WE SEE THE SAME
YOUNG USERS UH THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA
AND OLD USERS NOT
UH WELL WE UH FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE TWO SEVERAL MARKETS AT WHICH WE CAN AIM
UH THE FIRST ARE THE YOUNGER THE AGE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND FORTY FIVE
UH THEY ARE HIGHLY INTERESTED IN THE FEATURES AS YOU CAN SEE UH HERE
AND UM THEY ARE MORE CRITICAL ON THEIR MONEY SPENDING
UH THE SECOND GROUP IS THE OLDER GROUP
AGED BETWEEN FORTY SIX AND SIXTY FIVE
THEY ARE LESS INTERESTED IN UH NEW FEATURES
BUT UH THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY MORE EASILY
NOW IF WE LOOK BACK AT THIS GRAPH WE CAN SEE THAT AMONG THE FIRST GROUP IS ABOUT UM SIXTY PERCENT
AND THE SECOND GROUP ABOUT FORTY PERCENT
SO THE THE FIRST GROUP IS BIGGER
WELL THEN I COME TO MY UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES
UH YEAH THE FIRST QUESTION IS UH ALSO WE HAVE TO ASK IS AT THE WHICH MARKET DO WE AIM AT
UH OF COURSE N UH SAYING WE AIM AT THE YOUNG GROUP DOESN'T SAY THAT OLD PEOPLE WON'T BUY IT
BUT LESS OF THEM WILL BUY IT
UM WELL I UH OKAY
WHAT I THOUGHT UM EVEN YOUNG PEOPLE SAY IT'S HARD TO USE
REMOTE CONTROL
SO IF YOU MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT IS UH VERY EASY TO USE
THAT'S ESPECIALLY AIMED AT THIS GROUP EVEN UH THE YOUNG GROUP WILL ALSO BE MORE INTERESTED
AND UM WE CAN MAKE SPECIAL FEATURES
BUT UH I THINK IT LOOKS NICE IN THE FIRST TIME
BUT WHEN USE IT UH I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UH GOOD THING OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
UM WELL TH UH THAT'S MY SECOND POINT
UH LESS IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE DISCARDED FROM THE REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S ABOUT DISCUSSION WE HAD EARLIER
UM
YOU CAN FIND MOST FUNCTIONS ON A T. V. SET
SO UH YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF AUDIO OPTIONS OR SCREEN OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS
AND SUCH THINGS
UM WELL THE DESIGN IS VERY IMPORTANT
ONE THING I DID NOT SAY I THINK
IS THAT A LOT OF USERS ALSO SAID THEN I WOULD UH BUY A GOOD LOOKING UH REMOTE CONTROL IF THERE WILL BE ONE
BUT THEY FOUND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS VERY UGLY
SO THE DESIGN OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL IS VERY IMPORTANT
AND UH YEAH IT SHOULD BE VERY ZAP FRIENDLY AS MOST USERS USE IT FOR THAT
THAT WERE MY FINDINGS
YES
NO
OKAY
YEAH MAYBE WE CAN FIRST HAVE A DISCUSSION UH ON THE THE PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS YOU JUST UH SAID
THE THE REQUIREMENTS YOU JUST SAID MAYBE WE SHOULD FIRST HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT
I UH PERSONALLY THINK UH TELETEXT IS A GOOD OPTION
UH NOT EVERYONE UM WHO IS LOOKING T. V. CAN GO TO INTERNET WHEN THEY WANT TO SEE THE LATEST NEWS
OKAY
OKAY SORRY
THEN UH
MINE
IT'S THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
D YEAH
DO WE MAKE A MENU
UH
I THINK IT WILL BE UM Q QUITE EASY TO USE TO HAVE UH UH FOUR ARROWS
UP DOWN FOR CHANNEL SELECTION AND LEFT RIGHT UH FOR VOLUME
AND UH A MENU UH BUTTON
AND IF YOU PRESS THE MENU BUTTON YOU GET INTO THE MENU AND YOU CAN USE THE SAME BUTTONS
BUT THE THEN TO SCROLL THROUGH THE MENU AND TO CHANGE THE OPTIONS
UH WELL YEAH THAT DEPENDS ON IF YOU HAVE UH THE MENU ON THE T. V.
OR YOU GET THE MENU ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
YES
'KAY
BUT WELL IF YOU AIM AT THE YOUNGER MARKET UM A AS THEY AS UH S UH AS WE SEEN IN THE USABILITY UH LAB
UH THEY WILL BUY A NICE LOOKING UM
REMOTE CONTROL
AND ALSO TO FIND THE EASY TO USE UH PART VERY IMPORTANT
SO IF WE HAVE A L. C. D. SH UH SCREEN AND UH NOT TOO MANY BUTTONS
I THINK THAT WILL INCRE UH UH EVEN WHEN IT'S A BIT MORE COST IT WILL STILL SELL
MM
YEAH
OKAY
GOOD IDEA
OKAY
WELL LET'S START
WHAT ARE WE DOING
OOPS
OKAY
OKAY
NOT DOING
UH
VERY GOOD
OKAY
WE HAVE PRESENTATIONS
SO FIRST IT'S YOUR TURN
YEAH
ISN'T IT AMAZING
INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
INTERFACE CONCEPT
CAN YOU GO BACK ONE PAGE
FOR THE UH MENU WHAT DO WE USE FOR THAT
WE DON'T HAVE BUTTONS FOR THE MENU
OR WE MAY HAVE TO USE CHANNEL OF THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL
OKAY
BUT UH
YOU HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE
YEAH
YEAH BUT HAS TO BE CLEAR THAT YOU CAN USE THE ARROWS
MM-HMM
YES
THE SECOND ONE
OKAY
NOT TOO MUCH COLOURS
NO IT'S NOT FLOWER POWER
S OKAY
OKAY
THANK YOU
SO YOU'RE NEXT
HMM
NO ISN'T
BUT THE L. C. D. IS EASY WHEN YOU USE THE SCROLL UH BUTTONS
THEN YOU CAN SCROLL YOU SEE WHAT NUMBER AND THEN YOU PUSH
BUT THEN IT'S NOT EASY TO USE SCROLL UH
WHEEL
IF YOU DON'T
HMM YES
BUT THEN
YEAH THEN YOU GO ONE DOWN ONE UP
WHEN YOU SCROLL
YEAH BUT LIKE WE SAID BEFORE IT HAS TO BE USED ON EVERY TELEVISION
SO YOU MAY NOT BE UH
NO
THE TELEVISION MUST DO THAT
SO
YEAH BUT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE ALL THEIR UH ROOM
AND MOSTLY THEY ARE SMALLER
SO
MOST THE TIMES THAT ARE NOT ADVANCED TELEVISIONS
OKAY
THAT'S IMPORTANT
YEAH
MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK HOW HOW MUCH IT IS FOR THE L. C. D.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
YEAH MORE EXPENSIVE
BUT HOW MUCH
OH
OKAY
OKAY
WELL THANK YOU
NEXT
NO
IT'S CLEAR
SO NOW
IT'S UH AH LET'S SEE
NOW W WE HAVE TO DECIDE
WELL WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THE CONCEPT
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT
'S NEXT
COMPONENTS AND USER INTERFACE CONCEPT
SO
NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME CONCEPT
MAYBE ONE OF YOU CAN PAINT IT ON THE BOARD
FIRST UH USER INTERFACE
YES A CONCEPT ON UH JUST
YEAH BUT MAYBE WE CAN PAINT IT
UH WHAT DO WE WANT
I'LL PAINT
OKAY
WELL
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
OR
SHAPES OR WHAT DO WE NEED
YES OKAY
OKAY
AND YOU HAVE TO
YEAH
SO IT HAS TO BE SOFT
OKAY
AND UH THE BUTTONS
BUTTONS
NO IT WON'T
BUT WELL THERE ONE FOR THE SOUND AND ONE FOR THE CHANNELS
UH TWO SCROLL UH WHEELS
THAT'S TH THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT
IT'S BETTER IN
BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE A L. C. D. WE DON'T HAVE A MENU
YEAH BUT AGAIN MAYBE TH HOW DO WE KNOW THE T. V. CAN HANDLE IT
YOU DON'T KNOW
SO THERE'S NO MENU
NO
SO YOU CAN'T USE IT
OKAY WE MAKE TWO CONCEPTS
ONE WITH L. C. D.
ONE WITHOUT L. C. D.
GOOD CONCEPT
BUT
THAT'S ONE
IT'S ONE
TWO
NUMBER TWO
NO
BUT WHEN YOU HANDLE IT YOU PUT IT ON AND OFF
IT'S NOT GOOD TO USE
YEAH BUT I'LL ZAP
FUCK
OUT
NO IT'S NOT GOOD
NOW SECOND CONCEPT
ONE WITH L. C. D. ONE WITHOUT L. C. D.
THEN UH
PAINT IT
ONE WITH TWO SCROLL BUTTONS AND ONE WITH WITHOUT
YEAH
UH ONE WITH A WITH A MENU AND ONE WITHOUT A MENU
AND THE ONE WITH WITH A MENU HAS AN L. C. D.
UNBELIEVABLE
DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING
BLANK
YOU HAVE
NOT SO DIFFICULT
UH THAT'S THE MENU
THERE FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YOU HAVE TO
FOR THE MENU
MM-HMM
ONE
THAT WAY
AND ONE
THAT WAY
SO
THEN IT DEPENDS ON THE COST
S ON AND OFF
WHEN IT'S NOT TOO BIG
JUST LIKE A A PHONE
YES OKAY
VERY GOOD
IS IT BETTER
WHEN YOU UH THE MENU YOU HAVE TO GO THERE THERE THERE THERE
YEAH OKAY
THAT'S THAT'S THE OUTSIDE
BUT NOW THE FIRST THE BUTTONS
SORRY
MUTE
AND THE OTHER
YEAH
NOT SO DIFFICULT
BUT HOW DO YOU WANNA SOLVE IT
YEAH BUT ON THE MENU THAT'S NOT UH EASY
THEN YOU GO DOWN YOU SWITCH YOU GO INTO THE RIGHT YOU SWITCH YOU GO DOWN
YEAH
A JOYSTICK
YEAH
BUT IS IT UH
DOES THAT BREAK A JOYSTICK
OR A SMALL ONE JUST LIKE IN A LAPTOP
MEAN IT'S BETTER
BUT HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS
OH
WHY DO I PAY YOU FOR
UM WELL UM
BETTER IDEAS
FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLES I THINK SCROLL BUTTON'S GOOD
SO
THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THEM
YEAH BUT IS IT THAT'S NOT EXPENSIVE THAN UH JOYSTICK IS BETTER
A SMALL ONE
NO JUST LIKE IN A
A LAPTOP
SMALL ROUND
THEN IT'S
NOT SO BIG
OH THE SH YEAH BUT THEN YOU CAN YOU HAVE TO USE T WITH ONE HAND
SO
MAYBE IF IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE I THINK A JOYSTICK IS BETTER
A SMALL ONE
SO PLEASE LOOK AT IT
YEAH WE I THINK YOU GET IT
SO AFTER THIS MEETING YOU HAVE HALF AN HOUR TO UH FIX IT
YES
YOUR PROBLEM
NOT MINE
OKAY
SO DO WE HAVE OTHER CONCEPTS
THEN FOR THE COMPONENTS
WE USE A NORMAL BATTERY
THEN IT'S
CH CHEAPEST WAY I THINK
NO NO KINETIC
KINETIC IS UH CH MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE
SO WE USE A NORMAL BATTERY
CHIP
DEPENDS ON THE L. C. D.
SCROLL
YEAH
AND UH WE IF YOU USE THE L. C. D. WE HAVE TO
YES OKAY
SO DEPENDS ON THE L. C. D. AND THE SCROLL
OKAY
OKAY
SO UH THE SHAPES OF THE
DESIGN
DEPENDS ON THE L. C. D. AND BUT
IT HAS TO BE SMALL
I THINK
IF YOU HAVE PISTOL IT L. C. D. 'S NOT EASY
Y Y YEAH BUT
IF YOU USE A PHONE
K YEAH BUT BUT THEN YOU HAVE IT
LIKE TH IF YOU HAVE PISTOL YOU HAVE IT SO
AND THE SCREEN IS
WELL THEN YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT THIS WAY TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN
YEAH
NO
NO NO
YEAH BUT THEN YOU LOOK FORWARD
AND THEN YOU CAN Y
N WELL IF YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT
THEN IT GOES LIKE THIS
IF TH N WELL
YES OF COURSE
THAT'S GOOD GOOD
BUT THE UM IT MAY NOT BREAK
OKAY
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE
OKAY
YEAH OF COURSE
OKAY
THEN THIS IS THE DESIGN
AND THE BUTTONS ARE ON THE NEXT PAGE
SO DEPENDS ON THE COST
SO UM WE HAVE ONE MINUTE
I THINK
NO
MORE
SEVEN
NEXT MEETING
THIRTY MINUTES
SO HURRY UP
YOU TWO STAY HERE
PAINT IT
NOW YOU HAVE TO
SO
I THINK IT'S CLEAR
CHECK YOUR MAIL
SO
IT HAS TO BE READY IN THE NEXT MEETING
SO
NEXT MEETING IS CALLED THE DETAILED DESIGN
SO
EVERYTH EVERYTHING HAS TO BE READY
THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION
HMM
OH
MINE
OH GREAT
UH
YES WELL UH LET'S UH TALK ABOUT THE INTERFACE UH CONCEPT
UH FIRST I'LL UH I'LL UH DISCUSS THE BUTTONS WE JUST CHOSE UH SHOW YOU SOME SAMPLES UH
UH DISCUSS SOME COLOURS AND DESIGN MAYBE ALREADY
AND UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
WELL WE CHOSE THE POWER BUTTON TO SWITCH THE TELEVISION ON AND OFF
THE BU UH THE MUTE BUTTON TO SWITCH THE VOLUME ON AND O ON AND OFF
THE CHANNELS BUTTONS ONE TO NINE AND UH OFF UH UH ZERO TO NINE AND THE UH BUTTON TO CHOOSE UH HIGHER CHANNELS THAN NINE
UH THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL QUADRANTS UH LEFT AND RIGHT UP AND DOWN ARROWS TO UH DO THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL
AND THE MENU MENU BUTTON TO MAN MANIPULATE THE L. C. D. UH DISPLAY
UM I FOUND SOME UH INTERESTING UH UH SAMPLES
EXAMPLES
UM WELL UH WHAT'S PRETTY STANDARD IS UH THAT IT'S THAT THEY'RE ALL PRETTY UH UH HIGH UH
YEAH
YEAH
LARGE AND AND AND PRETTY THIN AND UH AND LONG
UM POWER BUTTONS ARE MOSTLY AT THE TOP
UH LEFT OR RIGHT
UM WELL WE SEE THE THE THE SAME UH
ARROWS
LIKE THERE
AND UH
YEAH WELL ARROW B BUTTONS CAN BE BLUE
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE THE THE ICONS ON THE BUTTONS
SOME BUTTONS HAVE ICONS LIKE THE PLAY AND STOP BUT WE DON'T USE THAT
BUT UH THESE WE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT ICONS OR OR LETTERS
UH THIS IS THE V. FOR VOLUME BUT THEY'RE BOTH UH A V.
SO IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY VERY UH CLEAR WHAT'S THE FUNCTION OF THAT
UM
YEAH
SO THAT'S
UH WELL
YEAH
I THOUGHT THAT WAS OUR UH IDEA
SO UH HOW
LIKE THIS
OR OR THIS
AND THAT THE MENU BUTTON IS OKAY
YEAH OKAY
UH SO THE
THE ICONS ON THE ARROWS AS WELL YOU MEAN
YEAH
UH WELL THAT'S SOMETHING TO UH THINK ABOUT
OKAY
UM WELL I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS ALREADY OR IN THE NEXT UH MEETING
BUT UH
AS WE HAVE TO UH TO TO DESIGN THE THE CASE AND THE WHOLE UH REMOTE CONTROL IN OUR UH OUR OUR CORPORATE UH COMPANY UH UH COLOURS AND THE LOGO
I WOULD UH RECOMMEND A YELLOW CASE
UH ROUND EDGES
THE LOGO AT THE BOTTOM
AND UH WELL MAYBE EACH EACH UH SET OF BUTTONS UH HAS UH HAS HIS OWN COLOUR
SO IT'S GOOD
UH RECOGNISABLE
K SO I THINK
UH NO
NOT TOO MUCH
BUT UH NO NO NO
BUT THIS HAS TO BE HAS TO BE TRENDY AND UH AND
UH YEAH SO GOOD UH GOOD ICONS ON THE BUTTONS AND UH AND BIG BUTTONS IS MY UH PERSONAL UH
OPINION
THAT WAS THAT
HMM
NO
MM YES
WHAT
MM
YEAH
BUT BUT I THAT'S THE ONLY SCROLL UH BUTTON ON IT THEN
YEAH OKAY
BUT BUT HOW
YEAH
HOW
OKAY
MM
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND YOU CAN AND YOU CAN UH MAKE THE THE POWER BUTTON AS A TRIGGER
LIKE UH
JUST TO UH
OH LIKE A
YEAH
BUT IF YOU PUT PUSH THE THE MENU BUTTON
YEAH WH WHAT
YES BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH OF THE SCROLL BUTTONS YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE
YEAH
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
YEAH
IT'S UH
OR YOU CAN UH
TURN IT INSIDE
BUT THAT'S
NO THAT'S TRUE
OKAY
COOKIE
AH PINBALL
HUH
UH MAYBE I'LL HAVE SOMETHING IN MY UH PRESENTATION
AND YOU WILL SEE IT
I'M NEXT OKAY
YES
NO
HERE WE GO
UH AT FIRST WE WILL UH I WILL F UH SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT
OUR UH GROUP W UH W UH WE WANT TO UH SELL OUR REMOTE CONTROLS TO
AND THEN I'LL DISCUSS WHAT MY OPINION IS ABOUT THE COSTS ABOUT UH WHAT BATTERY IS IN IT WHAT KIND OF BUTTONS ALSO
FIRST UH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE THEY WANT LIKE SOFT MAT UH MATERIALS AND PRIMARY COLOURS
LIKE TOTALLY YELLOW TOTALLY RED
UH SO IT'S VISIBLE
UH THE SHAPES ARE CURVED AND ROUND LIKE UH YOU ALSO SAID
MAYBE IT'S NICE TO UH GET A REMOTE CONTROL NOT LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES STRAIGHT AND UH FLAT AND LONG
BUT TO GIVE HIM THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND SO YOU IT'S EASIER TO USE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT THAT'S JUST AN IDEA
AND THEN
I'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE COSTS UH OF ALL THE THINGS FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
THE BATTERY THERE ARE FEW OPTIONS
UH I THINK THE BEST OPTION IS TO USE UH THE BASIC BATTERY
SO EVERYBODY CAN BUY IT UH AT THE AT THE SUPERMARKET
OR USE UH A K UH KINETIC BATTERY LIKE UH WITHIN A WATCH
WHEN YOU UH SHAKE IT A FEW TIMES IT IT'S LOADED
UH THE THE FORM OF THE REMOTE CONTROL I THINK IT'S ALSO NICE HAVE IT CURVED
AND MAYBE LIKE IT'S HAND SHAPED
UH SO UH YOU TAKE IT HERE IN YOUR HAND AND HERE ARE THE BUTTONS
UH MATERIAL YOU USE PLASTIC
HARD PLASTIC UH BECAUSE UH IT WON'T HAVE TO BURST UH LIKE IN THE IN ONE TIME
AND ALSO RUBBER BECAUSE THE YOUNGER PEOPLE LIKE THAT WHAT WE SEE IN THE RESEARCH
UH THE PUSH BUTTONS
WE HAVE ONE NEW THING UH DISCOVERED
IT'S A SCROLL PUSH UH THING LIKE A MOUSE
MAYBE IT'S UH EASY TO USE UH FOR THE CHANNELS
WHEN YOU WANT TO GO M MOVE UP YOU JUST SCROLL UP AND CLICK ON THE BUTTON
IF YOU WANNA SEE THE NEXT UH IF YOU WANNA SEE THAT CHANNEL
AND ALSO FOR THE MOUSE UH FOR THE VOLUME IT'S ALSO UH EASY TO USE
JUST SCROLL A BIT UP SCROLL A BIT DOWN
AND THAT'S ALSO EASY JUST W WHEN YOU HAVE A THING LIKE THIS AND YOU GET IT HERE
YOU CAN DO IT WITH YOUR THUMB
AND WITH YOUR L LEFT HAND YOU CAN UH PUSH THE BUTTONS UH IF YOU PUSH UH CHANNEL ONE YOU CAN SEE CHANNEL ONE
THE ELECTRICS UM WITH A SCROLL PUSH UH BUTTON WE MUST USE REGULAR UH CHIPS
THERE ARE ALSO UH SIMPLE CHIPS
THEY ARE UH CHEAPER
UM BUT THEN WE HAVE JUST A BASIC UH UH REMOTE CONTROL
AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE UH THINGS AND PEOPLE WON'T BUY IT ANY MORE
THEY HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF IT
AND YOU HAVE ALSO ADVANCED UM CHIPS
BUT THAT'S WITH THE L. C. D. UH SCREEN
AND THE COSTS WILL INCREASE A LOT MORE
AND I THINK OUR BUDGET IS TOO LOW TO USE AND AN L. C. D. AND THE CHIP WHO IS MORE EXPENSIVE
AND MAYBE IT'S ALSO THEN UH THOUGHTFUL IF WE U UH USE UH AS UM DIFFERENT KIND OF UH SHAPES FOR THE FOR REMOTE CONTROL
THAT WE THEN USE THE PRIMARY COLOURS
LIKE YOU GET A YELLOW UH REMOTE CONTROL RED ONE BLUE ONE ET CETERA
YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
I THINK THE MAIN THING IS WE LOOK AT THE COSTS
AND NOT TOO BASIC NOT A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL WHO EVERYBODY ALREADY HAS
NOT WITH AN L. C. D.
NO
YEAH
BUT THEN WHAT I SAY THE COSTS WILL UH GET A LOT HIGHER
TH THEN YOU'LL SEE IT ON THE TELEVISION
YEAH BUT L WHEN YOU SEE A MENU UH ON THE TELEVISION
IT'S LIKE YOU SEE UH ONE TO TWENTY YOU GO UH UH S SCROLL UP AND PUSH NUMBER TW TWENTY
MM-HMM
YEAH I THINK THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WILL HAVE NEWER TELEVISIONS WHICH
CAN PROVIDE OUR UH REMOTE CONTROL
YES
BUT THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM
I THINK
NO BUT THEN WE'LL GET TO THE REGULAR UH REMOTE CONTROLS
AND I THINK WHAT I SAID EVERYBODY HAS THEM UH HAS THEM ALREADY
AND THEY GO TO A UH SUPERMARKET AND BUY THEM UH FOR TWO EUROS
UH AND GE AND GET THE MOST CHEAPEST UH THING
AND I THINK WE MUST LOOK FURTHER TO UH TO DEVEL D DEVELOP SOMETHING NEWS
I GOT IT ON MY SCREEN AND IT WAS UH HIGHER
BUT I DON'T KNOW UH HOW MUCH HIGHER
THAT'S TRUE
BUT THEN WE'LL I THINK WE MUST DISCUSS WHO UH WHAT WILL BE BETTER
IF WE HAVE A BETTER SHAPE OF THE UM REMOTE CONTROL OR BETTER OPTIONS ON IT
WITH A SCROLL MENU A W SCROLL THING AND A L. C. D.
AND THEN A FLAT UM REMOTE CONTROL
OR A MORE HAND SHAPED REMOTE CONTROL WITH SCROLL WITHOUT L. C. D.
I CAN UH LOOK ON MY UH
UH
NOTE THAT THE PUSH BUTTON REQUIRES A SIMPLE CHIP CHIP
A SCROLL WHEEL REQUIRES MINIMALLY A REGULAR CHIP WHICH IS A HIGHER PRICE RANGE
THE DISPLAY REQUIRES A ADVANCED CHIP WHICH IS WHICH IN TURN IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REGULAR CHIP
DOESN'T SAY
THAT'S FROM MY MANUFACTURING DIVISION
YES
CHANGING COVERS
NOPE
UH UH UH
HOW W HOW WE HOW WE MAKE IT
UH
SHOULDN'T WE FIRST DISCUSS ABOUT LIKE WHAT W WE ALL
YEAH BUT IF I PAINT WITH
MORE LIKE SOMETHING
M LIKE YEAH I CAN'T DR I CAN'T DRAW IT
UH I HAVE TO
I'M NOT A DESIGNER
IT'S MORE THREE D.
LIKE UM WHEN YOU HAVE
A PART HERE
THIS IS THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE
TH THIS UNDER IT
SO IT'S EASIER TO GET IT LIKE THIS
IT'S LIKE A GUN
AND IT HAS TO BE SOFT YEAH
SO YOU CAN SQUEEZE IN IT AND SORRY
BUTTONS ON TOP OF IT
AND HERE
THE SCROLLING
YOU CAN DO IT WITH YOUR THUMB
BUT NOW WE USE ONE SCROLL BUTTON AND THE OTHER ONE IS HERE
ONE TILL UH UH ZERO TILL NINE
AND THE B
YEAH
OR TWO BUTTONS
IF UH 'KAY C IF WE DO IF WE USE ONE THEN WE'LL HAVE JUST A SWITCH ON IT
AND YOU'LL JUST SWITCH IT AND NOW IT'S THE SOUND TO SWITCH BACK
WITH THE MENU UH BUTTON
AND THEN YOU ALSO CAN SCROLL UH SCROLL IN IT
JUST NOT LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES WITH UH THIS THING AND UH HERE AN ARROW HERE AN ARROW HERE AN ARROW HERE AN ARROW
BECAUSE UH FROM H HUNDRED UH REMOTE CONTROLS NINETY NINE HAVE IT
UH THEN WE HAVE IT ON THE T. V. THE MENU
I DON'T KNOW
IT'S LIKE SOME SORT OF UH TELETEXT OPTION BUT WE DON'T HAVE TELETEXT
AND IF WE PUT AN L. C. D. THING ON IT THEN THE COSTS WILL UH BE MUCH HIGHER
'KAY
BUT YOU ALL LIKE THIS KIND OF THING
UH
WITH THE SCROLL BUTTON
AND AND THIS ONE HAS TO BE SOFT
AND THIS HAS TO BE HARDER BECAUSE WHEN IT FALLS IT MU MU MUST NOT BURST
OR SOME KIND OF RUBBER AROUND IT
YEAH
YEAH
AH THAT'S NICE
HERE
TRIGGER
PAINT IT
WITH THE SCROLL THING ON LIKE THIS
SO
DRAW IT
BUT IS IT EASY TO USE
WHEN YOU HAVE IT ON YOUR LEFT SIDE AND
SEPARATE MORE SEPARATE H YEAH
YEAH
ON THE LEFT A SCROLL BUTTON AND ON THE RIGHT A SCROLL BUTTON
BUT WOULD IT BE EASY TO USE THEN
IF IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE A BIG UH
I ALSO THINK THIS CONCEPT IS NOT WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE LOOKING FOR
THEY WERE LIKE ROUND CURVES UH DIFFERENT UH
OKAY OKAY OKAY
MM-HMM
PERSONALLY I THINK TWO SCROLL BUTTONS UH AREN'T EASY TO HANDLE
WITH THE SWITCH BUTTON
NO LIKE UH
OH YOU MEAN LIKE THAT
UH THEN YOU CAN ALSO HAVE LIKE UH TH UM
YEAH AND JOYSTICK I THINK
YEAH LIKE IN A LAPTOP S UH S SOME SORT OF THING
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER WITH EASIER THI
I DON'T KNOW
OR NO SCROLL UH THINGS
JUST A SHAPE
AND NO NO
IT WON'T WORK
YEAH
UH-HUH
OR A REMOTE CONTROL MORE LIKE JOYSTICK
A SMALL ONE LIKE THIS LIKE A NINTENDO UH K
PLAYSTATION THING
NO NO NO
I MEAN THE THE SHAPE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
JUST LIKE A PLAYSTATION THING
YEAH
NO THAT'S OKAY I GOT
UH THEY'RE NOT UH
IN DETAILS
IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE OR LESS EXPENSIVE HUH
THEN I HAVE TO COME WITH IT
I GOT MY PERSONAL COSTS
I I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THE COSTS
THEN I'LL UH MAKE SOMETHING UP
YEAH OR THE OR THE KINETIC UH WITH NORMAL BATTERY
YEAH I THINK IT'S UH YEAH MORE EXPENSIVE
YEAH
OKAY
DEPENDS ON THE SCROLL
IF WE USE A SCROLL THEN WE HAVE THE UH REGULAR CHIP
IF WE DON'T USE A SCROLL THEN WE CAN USE THE SIMPLE CHIP
AND THAT'S
UH THE MOST EXPENSIVE
YEAH
IF WE YEAH
IF WE NO OKAY SCROLL WHEEL
SO I HAVE THIS
SO IT WILL BE UH THE ADVANCED CHIP OR THE UH REGU UH OR THE REGULAR CHIP
OR SHALL WE JUST PUT IT ON THE PISTOL THING
AND THEN JUST PUT ALSO ON L. C. D. ON IT
JUST USE YOUR THUMB
IF YOU YEAH
I USE MY THUMB
YEAH
IF YOU HAVE A JOYSTICK ON
NO IF YOU HAVE LIKE UH AN UH UH A NI A UH PLAYSTATION UH GAME CONTROLLER
AND YOU MOVE UP F FORWARD DOWN LEFT
THEN YOU HAVE UH JUST YEAH A LITTLE BIT CURVED
IT'S NOT JUST UH STRAIGHT
THAT'S HOW WE USE IT
THAT'S WHY THEY MAKE JOYSTICKS LIKE THAT I THINK
YEAH
'KAY
HERE'S OUR DESIGNER
YEAH
YEAH WHY NOT
IT'S FOR THE YOUNGER PEOPLE
IT'S SOMETHING NEW
NOW WE PUT UH RUBBER AROUND IT
HARD PLASTIC UH THE SHAPE AND AROUND IT HARD UH AROUND IT RUBBER
AND THE UH THE HAND SHAPE IS ALSO RUBBER
HUH
THIS IS SOMETHING NEW
COSTS ARE OKAY
OH THAT'S US TOGETHER
YES
'KAY
BYE BYE
MM
AH
HEY
AH
NOW I HAVE MY SCREEN BACK TOO
YEAH
YEAH
VERY INTERESTING
LARGE
A LOT A LOT OF BUTTONS BUTTONS
YEAH
YES
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
HMM
YEP
YEAH
BUT THI I UH THIS IS WITH AN L. C. D.
NO NOT
UH CAN YOU GIVE AN INDICATION IN B UH IN THE COST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UH THE CHIP WITH L. C. D. OR WITHOUT
'CAUSE IT I THINK IF WE HAVE AN L. C. D. IT WILL ALSO SELL A LOT BETTER
AND THAT MIGHT UH BRING BACK THE COSTS UH
HUH
'KAY
MY TURN
MM
SO
SO
YEAH
SO MY UH PRESENTATION IS ABOUT TREND WATCHING
UH I DID SOME TREND WATCHING
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UH KEEP UP WITH LATEST TRENDS
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU WON'T SELL
SO WELL HOW WE DID DO THAT
UH WELL WE MADE AN INVESTIGATION OF THE MARKET BY TRENDWATCHERS
THEY UH WATCH IN UH CITIES LIKE UH PARIS AND MILAN
OF COURSE WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR UH TREND UH TRENDS
AND WELL UH WHAT DID YOU FIND
UH WE HAVE TWO GROUPS YOUNG AND TRENDY AND THE OLD AND RICH
WELL TH AND THE YOUNG AND TRENDY THEY UH THEY STARTING TO LIKE UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES UH AS A THEME FOR N UH CLOTHES
SHOES AND ALSO UH PRODUCTS
AND UM MATERIAL
THAT SHOULD FEEL HAVE UH A SPONGY FEELING
AND TO GET A FEELING FOR WHAT IT IS UH HERE IS AN IMAGE OF IT
THEN THE OLD AND RICH
THEY LIKE UH DARK COLOURS AND SIMPLE RECOGNISABLE SHAPES
AND UM THEY ALSO LIKE UH FAMILIAR MATERIAL UH ESPECIALLY WOOD
NOW ANOTHER PICTURE
TO GET A FEELING FOR THIS
WELL UH THEN ALREADY COME TO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES
WE UH AIM AT THE YOUNGER MARKET
SO WE SHOULD ALSO BE UH LOOK AT THEIR UH TRENDS
HOWEVER WITH TRENDS IT'S ALWAYS IF THERE'S IT'S NOW
IT IT IT MIGHT LAST ONE YEAR AND NEXT YEAR IT BE UH CAN BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT
AND I THINK WE WANT TO SELL OUR PRODUCT FOR LONGER THAN ONE YEAR
SO WE M MUST NOT JUST ONLY LOOK AT WHAT THE TREND IS NOW AS IT MIGHT BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT NEXT YEAR
SO THAT'S UH ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND
YEAH
ANY QUESTIONS
YEAH
MM
CAN MAKE SEVERAL UH CONCEPTS
WE HAVE THIS AND WE HAD THE IDEA OF AN UM A MORE UH UH UH LIKE SH IN THE SHAPE OF YOUR HAND
YEAH I I I UH YES
YEAH
A G MM
YEAH
AND I IF WE GO TO UH
BUT IF WE HAVE UH A ME YEAH
IF WE HAVE A MENU UH HOW DO WE UH CHOOSE OTHER OPTIONS
YEAH
UH UH
UH UH
YEAH
YEAH
M UH YEAH MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF THE UH SCROLL WHEELS ARE UM MORE SEPARATE YEAH
LIKE YOU HAVE THE MENU BUTTON IN BETWEEN UH
YEAH
THINK WE HAVE WE HAVE NOW TWO BUTTONS MISSING
THE UH UM
THE MUTE BUTTON
WE HAVE TWO BUTTONS MISSING
THE MUTE BUTTON
AND UM THE TO TO UH HAVE TO UH NUMBERS
OKAY
BUT UH
OKAY
AND ON THE L. C. D. HOW MUCH IT COSTS
UH IT COSTS EXTRA
YEAH
YES
UH
UH YEAH BUT
YEAH
IF YOU
IF WE HAVE UH THEN SOMETHING STANDING HERE WITH THE L. C. D.
UM YEAH
I CAN'T SEE THE

'KAY SO UNCURVED OR FLAT
NOPE
SINGLE CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED

WE CAN'T LOSE THE DOUBLE CURVE
WE HAVE RUBBER SPECIAL COLOUR
OH NO WE NO IT'S UH

TWO EUROS
THEN WE HAVE THIRTEEN EUROS
HALF A EURO TOO MUCH
EXACTLY THE SPECIAL COLOURS

THAT'S ONE EURO
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD
MM
I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THE L. C. D.
IF

WE UH WE HAD SOME UH WE HAD A NEW IDEA THAT THAT THIS CAN UH CAN BE UH UH TURNED INSIDE
AND THEN IT COVERS THE THESE BUTTONS
UNTIL HERE OR SOMETHING
AND THEN YOU CAN STILL USE THE THE POWER BUTTON AND THE MUTE AND THE THE JOYSTICK
SO YOU CAN STILL OPERATE UH ALL THE THINGS
BECAUSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS USE THE MENU

ALL THE SAME UH
MM YEAH
RECOGNISABLE
LIKE WHAT YEAH
MM YEAH
OKAY
YEAH WELL THE SAME
I I ESPE I ESPECIALLY UH LIKED THE THE MEANS THE THE SMARTBOARD AND UH
YEAH IT UH
IT BRINGS UP NEW IDEAS WHEN YOU WORK WITH UH WITH IT
YEAH
MM-HMM
NO
I DON'T CARE
HUH
BIG
YES
UP IS CHANNEL UP
DOWN IS CHANNEL DOWN
TO THE RIGHT IS VOLUME UP
TO THE LEFT IS VOLUME DOWN
THE R. R.
I'LL GET IT
I THINK THE SCROLL BUTTON IS SOMETHING ALSO UH NEW
WHAT UH NOT ANOTH UH NOT A LOT OF UH A LOT OF UH REMOTE CONTROLS HAVE
I THINK TECHNOLOGICALLY I'LL GIVE IT AN
SEVEN
SI SIX SIX
SORRY SIX
OH TRUE OR FALSE
OH UH I'LL I'LL GIVE IT UH A T A TWO
SORRY
FIVE
MM-HMM
MAYBE VERSION UH THREE POINT O. UH HAS OTHER COLOURS
FOUR
ME TOO A TWO BECAUSE ONLY THE BATTERY IS NOT UH
TECHIN UH TECHNOLOGICALLY HIGH STANDARD
BUT THE REST OF IT IS
SO I THINK A TWO

'KAY
THREE IS OKAY
OH WE'LL WAIT OUTSIDE
I GIVE IT A ONE
SAY TWO

WH
WHAT WHAT ARE THE COSTS
FIFTEEN
A SPECIAL COLOUR
UH I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY SPECIAL COLOUR
YELLOW

UH
OH WAIT WAIT WAIT
OH YEAH
OH YEAH

YEAH YEAH
IF WE LOSE THE L. C. D. THEN WE HAVE AN UH REGULAR CHIP AND NO L. C. D.
UH YEAH
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO M UH SEE THE MENU ON THE TELEVISION
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
THE L. C. D.
SO THE T. V. S HAS TO UH HAVE TO BE UP TO DATE
YEAH
YEAH
HUH
NO KNEW THAT
YEAH THEN IT'S TWELVE EURO FIFTY THEN IT'S OKAY
SO ALL THE BUTTONS HAS TO HAVE TO BE THE SAME COLOUR

MAKE IT UH
FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE WHAT BUTTON IT IS
UH L HOW YOU CALL IT
RECOGNISABLE YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OH WELL THAT'S CLEAR
AND THE JOYSTICK AWAY
AND ITS BUTTONS
YEAH
ABOUT THE
PROCESS
WENT GOOD
UH
I THINK UH THE CREATIVITY UH WAS GOOD ENOUGH
WE HAVE A GUN INSTEAD OF A REMOTE CONTROL
UM
UH LEADERSHIP
YEAH YOU WERE THE PROJECT PROJECT MANAGER AND UH HAD THE FINAL VOTE
SO YEAH THAT WAS CLEAR
TEAM WORK OKAY
EVERYBODY UH HAS SOMETHING UH TO SAY ABOUT IT
AND UH NO UH O ONLY THE THE DRAWING UH WAS VERY DIFFICULT
BUT NAH
NEW IDEAS FOUND
NOPE
NO
YEP
BEER
YEAH
OKAY THEN
THIS IS IT
YES
YEAH
THAT'S ON THE RUB RUBBER PART
YEAH
ALRIGHT
DO WE DO WE CHANGE THE
DO WE CHANGE THE THE ORDER
OR ARE WE GOING TO UH EV EVALUATE IT FIRST
OKAY
THAT'S UH UM THAT CAN BE NONE
UM WE GONNA DO THE EVALUATION NOW TOGETHER
BUT I HAVE UH A INTRODUCTION HOW IT WORKS
SO IT WILL COME UP
UH OH
OKAY
UM YEAH
WELL WE UH UH I HAVE UM THINKED A FEW EVALUATION UH CRITERIAS
UH BASED ON UM OUR MARKETING STRATEGY ON UH THE LATEST TRENDS ON USER PREFERENCES
UH WE HAVE A SEVEN POINT SCALE FROM UH TRUE AS WELL
TO FALSE SEVEN
AND ON BASE OF EACH C UH CRITERIA WE NEED TO UM GIVE A RATING
WE CAN UH WELL IT LOOK LIKE THIS
BUT WE GONNA UH DO IT HERE THEY SAID
SO YOU HOPE FOUND OUT HOW TO DO IT WITH A WORD DOCUMENT
YEAH
OKAY YEAH
YEAH
UM WELL UH WE HAVE THE WORD DOCUMENT
YOU SO WE OPEN UP THAT BLANK HERE
UM
THINK I CAN UH WHAT THIS JUST AN EXAMPLE
SO THIS NOT VERY IMPORTANT
BUT UM IF I CAN
GET A NUMBER IN HERE
HMM
WELL UH WE CAN'T DO THAT
UM SO UH YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT AS UH THE REMOTE CONTROL IS TECHNO TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
UH AND THEN WE HAVE TO UH AGREE ON THE RATING TOGETHER
AND IN THE END WE WILL C UH COUNT AN AVERAGE
OF ALL RATING
THE FIRST UH ON EACH ITEM
YEAH I THINK IT'S UH UH WELL TECHNOLOGICALLY USING IT'S NOT UH IT DOESN'T CONTAIN MANY NEW FEATURES
ONLY THE L. C. D.
SO IT UM I THINK I WILL GIVE IT A YEAH YEAH YEAH A FOUR
HMM
SO NOW I I THINK YOU UH SEE IT UM ITS STATEMENT
AND YOU TRUE OR FALSE
AND TRUE IS ONE
SO YEAH
YEAH
'KAY
UM WELL
IT'S A ONE
THE FIRST ITEM
SO OKAY THE SECOND ITEM
UM THIS PRODUCT IS FOR ALL SORTS OF CUSTOMERS
WELL IT'S A STATEMENT WHICH UH I DISAGREE WITH
BECAUSE WE UH REALLY AIM UH AT AT YOUNG MARKET AND I THINK THE WAY IT LOOKED UH C UH TOTALLY IN YELLOW
IT'S NOT UH REALLY AIMED FOR ALL CUSTOMERS
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT
THAT'S UH A SIX
FOUR
UH OKAY
MM
THAT'S UH THE MOTTO OF OUR COMPANY
YEAH WELL DO WE DO THIS WITH UH THIS PRODUCT
I UM YEAH
I THINK IF WE DO THIS AS IT'S UH UH C UH IT'S REALLY ORIENTATES ON THE DESIGN
UM SO I WOULD GIVE IT A TWO
TWO
UH OKAY
OKAY
YES I'LL THINK OF THAT TOO
YEAH AGREE
A THREE
YEAH OKAY
THE NEXT ELEMENT UM IS THE PRODUCT LOOKS GOOD
WELL PERSONALLY I DO NOT PREFER A UM REMOTE CONTROL THAT'S FULLY IN YELLOW
SO I WOULD GIVE THIS A FIVE
WE HAVE TO DO OUR UH TWO OR THREE
TWO
OKAY
SO WELL WE GONNA DO THE NEXT PART
UH YEP
UH UH THE NEXT STATEMENT
IT HAS NOT TOO MUCH BUTTONS
UM YEAH I I HAVE UH SAID IS NOT BECAUSE UH A LOW NUMBER IS BETTER
AND IN THE END WE CALCULATE AN AVERAGE
SO UM THAT'S WHY IT'S A NEGATIVE IN IT
UM WELL THIS ONE OF OUR AIMS NOT HAVE TOO MUCH BUTTONS
SO UM UH DID WE UH DO THAT
WELL UH IF WE GO TO UH THIS FASHION I WE STILL HAVE CAUSED UH A LOT OF UH BUTTONS FOR THE NUMBERS
BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN GO FOR THAT
AND UM THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS OVER
SO I WOULD GIVE THIS A TWO
ONE
UM BUT WHERE WHERE IS THE
SO
YEAH DID WE IMPLEMENT UH THE SOUND
YEAH
IT WON'T
ONE
OKAY UM WELL WE AIMED FOR THE YOUNGER MARKET
UH YEAH DID WE ACHIEVE THAT
I THINK WITH THE WAY IT LOOKS AND UM IT IS DESIGNED I WILL GIVE IT A TWO
YEAH
UH YES
THAT THAT WAS UH YEAH ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT UH TRENDWATCH SAID
I DIDN'T UH SAY IT IN MY PRESENTATION
BUT UM WELL DOES IT HAVE THAT
I WOULD SAY YES
SO UM
WELL LET'S ALSO GIVE THIS A TWO
T
YEAH
OKAY
TWO
AND UM THEN THE LAST ONE I COULD THINK OF UH IT GOES WITH THE LATEST TRENDS
IF WE LOOKED AT THE LATEST TRENDS FOR THE UH YOUNGER PEOPLE AND THEY ATE UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
WELL IT HAS A UM A NICE COLOUR UH WELL COMPARED TO FOOD BUT WE DIDN'T UH
WE DID NOT PAINT ANY UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE ON IT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO I WOULD DID NOT GIVE THIS UH A ONE OR TWO
I WE'LL GO FOR A THREE
YES
A THREE
OKAY
SO UM COME BACK TO THE PRESENTATION NOW
SO WE FIND YOURSELF THERE AND NOW WE HAVE TO CALCULATE AN AVERAGE RATING
SO WE WILL DO THAT
YES
BY NINE
YEAH
UM UH OKAY
TWO
COME ON
SO UH THAT'S A PRETTY LOW RATING I THINK
SO ACCORDING TO OUR UH OWN EVALUATION UH WE DID A GOOD JOB
OH
NAH
HOW AM I DOING
YES
AND I CLOSED YOUR SLIDE SHOW
WHICH ONE WAS THE LAST FOR YOU
UH DREAMING
NEXT
FINANCE
YEAH
ONE
WE WOULD HAVE UH N
FOR A REMOTE CONTROL
I'VE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL I THINK IT IS
IF WE WOULD HAVE UH UH NORMAL BUTTONS INSTEAD OF UH THE JOYSTICK
FOR UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT
THE ADVANCED CHIP WAS FOR THE L. C. D. WASN'T IT
IF UH
IF WE HAVE THE N NO BUTTONS IF WE HAVE WE HAVE UH NOT A JOYSTICK BUT BUTTONS WE WOULD HAVE UH WE HAVE THIRTEEN EUROS
AND THEN UH WE MOVE THE THE COLOUR
WHAT WILL THAT BE
YEAH
STILL HE WAITED AT THE
NO
PROJECT
YEAH I THINK YOU HAVE TO COMPARE IT TO IF YOU WOULD HAVE A NORMAL UM NORMAL PROJECT WITHOUT LAPTOPS UH AND WITHOUT THESE DEVICES
I THINK UM
WELL THE LAPTOPS IF YOU HAVE THEM OUT FRONT OF YOU YOU SOMETIMES LOOKING AT THAT INSTEAD OF THE PRESENTATION
UM WELL UH THE DRAW BOARD WELL YOU CAN DRAW THINGS
BUT IT NOT REALLY GOING VERY CONVENIENT
UH MAYBE IT WILL BE EASIER IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER MONITOR AND UH YOU WOULD ALSO SEE THERE
AND WITH A NORMAL MOUSE
UM AND UH THE PROJECT
YEAH I AGREE ON WHAT WAS SAID UH MAINLY
UH YEAH BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE TALKING MORE THAN OTHERS
AND MAYBE IS THEN UM THE TASK OF THE THE PROJECT MANAGER TO ALSO UH ASK MORE TO THE PEOPLE UH LESS TALKING
TO TELL THEIR OPINION
YEAH
OKAY
G GOOD MORNING
OH YEAH
ARE YOU READY
YOU SHOULD PUT THE LAPTOP UH RIGHT INTO THE SQUARE
FOR I FOR THE CAMERAS YES
GOOD MORNING SEBASTIAN
I'M FINE
UM WELL ACTUALLY I DIDN'T GO DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT
SO DO YOU WANT TO OPEN IT AS READ ONLY
UM I GUESS I SHOULD CLOSE IT HERE
OKAY THE WAITING IS FOR OUR MARKETING EXPERT RUUD
UM PROJECT KICK OFF

IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LAPTOPS ARE UM EXACTLY ON THE SQUARE UM FOR THE CAMERAS
OKAY
OKAY
UM WE'RE HERE TO DEVELOP UH A NEW PRODUCT
UM I'M SURE YOU'VE HAD A MAIL FROM OUR ACCOUNT MANAGER ABOUT IT
UM AND UM THIS IS THE FIRST MEETING TO TO GENERATE SOME UH UH SOME IDEAS ABOUT IT
UM YOU ARE HERE IN A SPECIFIC ROLE
UH RUUD IS HERE AS THE MARKETING EXPERT ROO IS HERE AS THE USER INTERFACE DESIGNER AND SEBASTIAN IS HERE UH IN THE ROLE OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
IS THAT CORRECT
OKAY
UM WE'RE GOING TO DO UM UH UH A LITTLE TOOL TRAINING UH FOR THE TOOLS WE ARE GOING TO USE UH DURING UH THE MEETINGS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE HERE
UM THEN I WILL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY IDEA OF THE PROJECT PLAN UH AND WE WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION
UH THIS MEETING SHOULD TAKE NO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES SO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND
THERE IS
YEAH THERE IS
NO PROBLEM
UM OKAY THIS NEW PRODUCT WE ARE ARE G ARE GOING TO DEVELOP UM
IT'S A REMOTE CONTROL A TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL
UM AND FIRST OF ALL IT SHOULD BE ORIGINAL IT SHOULD BE TRENDY AND USER FRIENDLY
THOSE ARE KIND OF EASY UM UH UH GOALS UM AND I'M SURE WE CAN FIND MORE GOALS FOR THE FOR THE PRODUCT WE ARE GOING TO DEVELOP
UM WE WILL DISCUSS UH LATER ON MORE IDEAS ABOUT UH HOW THE REMOTE SHOULD LOOK AND HOW IT SH IT SHOULD FUNCTION AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS
THE MARKET WE SHOULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE MARKET
UM WE ARE GOING TO USE A A PRED A PROJECT METHOD UH DURING UH THIS DEVELOPMENT UM WHICH CONSISTS OF THREE DIFFERENT DESIGN STAGES
UH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THE DETAILED DESIGN UM ALL OF THESE STAGES UM UM MEAN THAT WE DO SOME INDIVIDUAL WORK
PREPARE AND THEN UH MEET TO DISCUSS OUR UH UH THE THE THE PROGRESSIONS YES
UM THE FIRST STAGE THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UM WE ARE GOING TO SEARCH FOR THE USER REQUIREMENTS AND WE WILL UM MAKE A SPECIFIC UH SPECIFICATION OF THAT
UM THE SECOND IS THE TECHNICAL FUNCTIONAL DESIGN UM WHAT EFFECT SHOULD THE REMOTE HAVE
WELL IN THIS CASE CONTROL T THE THE TELEVISION I THINK
UM AND THE LAST ONE IS THE WORKING DESIGN
HOW EXACTLY DOES IT WORK IN THE TECHNICAL SENSE
UM THE OTHER DESIGN STAGES UH WE WILL DISCUSS THAT LATER
SO WE'LL KOP IT KEEP IT WITH THE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
OKAY UM BEFORE WE THINK ABOUT REMOTE CONTROL WE WILL UM WORK WITH SOME OF THE TOOLS WE HAVE UH HERE
UM AS YOU SEE NOW I CAN GIVE A PRESENTATION
UM IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO USE THIS ONE AS WELL
YOU CAN UH UH DISPLAY PR UH TWO PRESENTATIONS IF YOU WANT TO
UM
TO UM PRESENTATE
TO SHOW US UH A FILE YOU'LL NEED TO UH PLACE IT IN YOUR PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER WHICH IS ON YOUR DESKTOP AT LEAST IT SHOULD BE
UM THEN WE HAVE THIS ELECTRONIC WHITE BOARD SYSTEM
UM
YEAH I WILL SHOW THAT NOW
UM
YOU CAN DRAW ON THE BOARD USING THIS PEN
THERE ARE LITTLE UM UH SENSORS SO DO NOT GRAB IT HERE BUT A LIT MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE UH TO THE END
UM
WELL IT IT'S ON THE UM ERASER NOW SO WE CLICK THE PEN BUTTON
OKAY SO NOT TOO FAST WRITING
UM
YOU CAN INSERT A NEW UM SLIDE OR OR WHITE BOARD UH UH FILE UM BY EITHER USING THE INSERT FUNCTION OR BY CLICKING THE NEXT BUTTON OR THE BLANK BUTTON
IT'S QUITE THE SAME
UM ALL OUR UM WHI UM UH SMARTBOARD UM NOTES SHOULD BE KEPT IN THE SAME FILE
SO DO NOT M MAKE A NEW FILE
JUST USE THIS ONE UH DURING THE DAY
UM YOU CAN USE THE ERASER TO
MAKE SOMETHING GO AWAY
YES
YEAH
YEAH IN THE MEETINGS ONLY IN THE MEETINGS
IT'S REALLY LIKE LIKE A REGU REGULAR WHITEBOARD
UM YOU CAN CHOOSE THE FORMAT UM SORRY
UH
LET ME SEE
UM
WELL
I GUESS IT'S MAYBE BECAUSE I'M NOT S UH PEN SELECTED
YEP
CURRENT COLOUR YOU CAN CHOOSE ANOTHER COLOUR

UM SO NOW I D HAVE A DIFFERENT
LINE WIDTH AND UH COLOUR
OKAY
QUITE EASY IF YOU UH DO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS JUST C ASK ME
UM TO UM OH WELL I'M I WROTE DOWN THE DOCUMENTS UH SHOULD BE IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER IF YOU WANT TO UH DISCUSS IT WITH US
UM AS A LITTLE TRAINING UM I WILL ASK RUUD FIRST TO DRAW UH UH YOUR OWN ANIMAL ON A NEW SLIDE UH WITH UH A DIFFERENT COLOUR AND A DIFFERENT LINE WIDTH THAN THE ONE UH NOW SELECTED
A RABBIT
OKAY WELL GREAT
UM ROO COULD YOU DO THE SAME PLEASE
BUT A DIFFERENT ANIMAL WITH A DIFFERENT COLOUR AND A DIFFERENT LINE WIDTH
SEBASTIAN IS THINKING ABOUT THE ANIMAL

OKAY
I'M GUESSING A HORSE
YES OKAY
BEAUTIFUL
OKAY SO UM YOU CAN USE THIS AT ANY TIME DURING THE PRESENTATION IF YOU WANT TO
UM ANY QUESTIONS WELL JUST JUST LET ME KNOW
UM OKAY BACK TO OUR PROJECT
UM THE REMOTE CONTROL WE ARE GOING TO DEVELOP UM WILL HAVE A SELLING PRICE OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
UH THE PROFIT WE ARE LOOKING FOR FOR THIS PRODUCT IS FIFTY MILLION EUROS
WHICH IS QUITE A NUMBER
UM WE UH WE WILL FOCUS THIS INTERNATIONALLY SO THE PRODUCT WILL BE SOLD UM
IF THERE IS MARKET UH INTEREST UH IN IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY
AND UM THE PRODUCTION COSTS SHOULD NOT BE MORE THAN UH TWELVE EURO FIFTY
SO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND BY UH W W DURING THE DEVELOPMENT UM BECAUSE UH WELL THOSE ARE IMPORTANT NUMBERS
UM THEN THE DISCUSSION MAYBE THE TIME FOR SEBASTIAN TO SHOW HIS PRESENTATION
LIMITATIONS
OKAY
OKAY GREAT
YEAH
OKAY SO THE THE MAIN POR UH THE MAIN POINTS YOU ARE UH TELLING US ARE FOCUS ON THE INTER UH OPERABILITY AND
OKAY AND AND UH

UM OKAY
GREAT
UM
I'LL GO BACK TO MY OWN PRESENTATION
UM
MM
OKAY
UM I I DO THINK IT'S TIME NOW TO TO DISCUSS UH MM SOME THINGS
UM SEBASTIAN TOLD US A FEW THINGS ABOUT THE TECHNICAL IMPLEMEN UH IMPLICATIONS
UM THERE ARE OTHER THINGS LIKE UM HOW TO MAKE IT TRENDY WHICH IS I THINK UH UM MOST UH RU UH RUUD'S UH ROLE
UM THE WAY HOW IT SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE USER WHICH IS UH ROO UH R UH DURING THIS PART
UM SO LET'S START WITH YOU
H HOW DO YOU THINK THE REMOTE SHOULD UM FUNCTION FOR THE USER
YEP
OKAY SO WE'RE WE'RE GOING BUSINESS TO CONSUMER NOT WE'RE WE'RE IT'S NOT A
NO

OKAY UM UH I JUST WANT TO HEAR UH RUUD'S UM INPUT FOR THIS MEETING
UM DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ALREADY W UM AB IDEA ABOUT HOW THE MARKET UH WILL RESPOND TO THE SUCH A PRODUCT
OR WHAT WE SHOULD TAKE UM IN ACCOUNT WHEN DEVELOPING SUCH A PRODUCT
MM-HMM
BECAUSE
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SEBASTIAN DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS
OKAY
YEAH YEAH OKAY BECAUSE BECAUSE WE WA WE WANT TO DEVELOP A TRENDY PRODUCT
SO
YEAH TWELVE EURO FIFTY YEAH
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
OKAY UM I HA I HAVE ONE POINT F UM WHICH WHICH COMES IN MIND NOW
UM UH D I THINK THE DEVICE SHOULD EITHER BE RECHARGEABLE VERY EASILY UM OR IT SHOULD NOT CONSUME TOO MUCH UM POWER
BECAUSE IT'S VERY ANNOYING IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE BATTERIES EVERY S UH UH EVERY OTHER WEEK
SO UM
MAYBE WE COULD UM FOR EXAMPLE UH ONLY LIGHT THE BUTTONS THAT ARE UM UH APPLICABLE AT THAT MOMENT OR YEAH
I DUNNO IT'S UH THAT'S MORE SEBASTIAN'S UH UM
WELL DOES IT
I'M NOT SURE
UH
YEAH
OKAY
GENTLEMEN I'M AFRAID WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE TIME
UM
SO WE WILL GO BACK TO OUR OWN UH WORK
UM NEXT MEETING STARTS IN THIRTY MINUTES AND UM WELL YOU KNOW YOUR O YOUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS OR YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL PROBABLY EMAIL YOU ABOUT TH IT
UM SO
THIS WAS IT
SEE YOU IN THIRTY MINUTES
GOOD MORNING FLORES
MARKETING EXPERT
RIGHT
FOR THE CAMERAS
ALRIGHT
GEEZ
YOU HAVE THE SAME MESSAGE OF UH WINDOWS CANNOT UM
SEN OH STAND BY
CLOSE THE THE WINDOW
SO
THAT'S RIGHT
RUUD
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
ALRIGHT
OKAY
PROGRESSIONS
IT'S FOR THE VISION
YEAH
SENSORS
BUT WE ALL USE THE SAME WHITE BOARD FILE
SO WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON IT WHILE WE'RE OR SHOULD WE ONLY USE IT IN THE IN THE MEETINGS
YEAH OKAY
YEAH ALRIGHT
YEP
IT'S A BUNNY
BUT OF COURSE FLORES
BLANK
YEAH I'M THINK ABOUT IT TOO
FORMAT
WELL IT LOOKED MORE THAN A BUNNY THAN A CAT BUT IT WORKS RIGHT
WITH A VERY SMALL LEGS
YOU SHOULD FEED THAT UH THAT ANIMAL
OKAY
OKAY
AND FOR A CELL PHONE
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
BUT
YEAH BUT THE INFRARED IT'S UH WELL A LITTLE BIT OLD FASHIONED IF YOU WOULD CALL IT LIKE THAT
BUT ALL THE T. V. S ARE UH EQUIPPED WITH INFRARED SO
Y YOU YOU CAN
MOST OF THEM
OR YOU SHOU SH USE A YOU SHOULD EQUIP INFRARED AND BLUETOOTH TOGETHER IN ONE REMOTE
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL I HAD A FEW UH THINGS IN MIND
UM WELL THE INTEROPERABILITY JUST LIKE UH SEBASTIAN SAID UM THE REMOTE SHOULD WORK ON DIFFERENT T. V. S OR EVEN DIFFERENT UH UM
YEAH UH WHAT IS IT DEVICES
UM SO I I I THINK IT'S A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL FOR CUSTOMERS TO BUY JUST NEW IN UH A STORE
IT'S NOT FOR UH FOR UH FOR UH PHILIPS OR WHATEVER TO BUY OUR REMOTE FOR THEIR OWN PRODUCT RIGHT
YEAH I DO I DON'T KNOW THAT
IT'S NO I HAVE UH DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION FOR IT
NO OKAY
YEAH
UM
WELL THE TECHNI FU TECHNICAL FUNCTION UH WHAT YOU SAID IS JUST BY PRESSING THE BUTTON YOU SHOULD CHANGE THE STATE OF THE T. V.
THAT'S JUST THE BASIC F TECHNICAL FUNCTION
SO THAT WAS MY REALLY MY PART FOR UH THIS SESSION
UM
WELL THAT'S JUST THE FU THE TECHNICAL FUNCTION IS PURE WHAT SHOULD THE REMOTE CONTROL DO
WH WHAT IS HIS TASK UH AS AN UH AS AN UH DEVICE
IT JUST SHOULD CHANGE THE T. V. 'S STATE
SO THAT'S IT
UM BUT FURTHERMORE
YEAH
YEAH WITH BUTTONS
YEAH OR MAYBE YOU WANT A TOUCH SCREEN OR
BUT
YEAH
THEY'RE VERY VU VULNERABLE
YEAH
YEAH
AND FOR OTHER USER INTERFACE I HAD UM WELL IT'S MORE INDUSTRIAL THING
UH POINT AT A T. V. I THINK IT'S IT'S QUITE DISTURBING WHEN YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO POINT DIRECTLY TO THE T. V.
SO YOU MUST POINT EVERYWHERE SO MAYBE INFRARED IS
YEAH JUST DON'T EVEN POINT IT SO IN THAT CASE INFRARED SHOULD UH MAYBE UH BE RESTRICTION TO THAT
YEAH IF YOU G IF YOU GO TO RADIO OR OR YEAH
FOR T. V. YOU'RE ALWAYS IN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF A T. V. SO I DON'T THINK THINK
THE RANGE SHOULD BE A PROBLEM TO THAT BUT IF YOU WANT TO UH GET IT WORKING WITH A RADIO
AND YOU'RE IN OUTSIDE YOUR GARDEN WITH JUST ONE UH SPEAKER THEN MAYBE THE RANGE SHOULD BE UH
BUT
YEAH
TWO MORE THINGS
UM
YOU SHOULD ABLE TO FEEL THE BUTTONS WITHOUT UH IT MIS UM YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE BUTTONS
SO IT SHOULD BE AS USER INTERFACE UM FOR FEELING SHOULD BE UH GOOD TO UNDERSTAND
YOU MUST FEEL THE BUTTONS FOR VOLUME OR WHATEVER I THINK
AND OF COURSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHERE ALL BUTTONS ARE SO IT SHOULD BE VISIBLE AL UM IN DARK TOO
SO WHEN IT'S DARK
THOSE ARE TWO REALLY UH USER INTERFACE
YEAH
THAT'S PERFECT
YEAH
YEAH
WELL MAYBE I UM BUT IT IT CAN BE QUITE SIMPLE YOU CAN JUST HAVE WHITE BUTTONS WITH A BLACK MARK ON IT
THE UH THE THE DIGITS IN BLACK
UH THEN IT'S ALREADY VISIBLE IN DARK
SO IT IT DON'T HAVE TO BE A LIGHTNING OR OR A FANCY WELL IT CAN BE FOR DESIGN OF COURSE
JUST REMIND SOMETHING
THE DIGITS OF UH THE THE PAINTING ON THE BUTTONS SHOULD NOT FADE
YOU HAVE A M UH
ALWAYS HAVE S THE SOFT BUTTONS ALWAYS UH
CLEAR THE THE THE PAINT ON IT
THE MARKS
YEAH
BUT UM
NECESSARY YEAH
YEAH
BUT THEN BLUETOOTH UH MIGHT BE PROBLEM
'CAUSE I THINK BLUETOOTH UH
YEAH I KNOW IT FROM THE CELL PHONE
BUT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T USE BLUETOOTH ALL THE TIME TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY
DOES IT
IT'S OVER
OKAY
GREAT
GOOD MORNING MISTER P. M.
HOW ARE YOU TODAY
HOW WAS YOUR BUSINESS TRIP TO BOSTON
IS THERE A SCHEDULE FOR THIS MEETING
I SHALL CLOSE THE DOOR
THAT'S CORRECT
OKAY
UM IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR A LITTLE PRESENTATION
UH MAYBE DURING THE DISCUSSION UH SECTION
OKAY
ALRIGHT
I'M JUST UH GUESSING WHAT SHOULD BE MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL
WELL I'LL GIVE IT A TRY
MM
VERY GOOD
I WAS VERY GOOD IN DRAWING
WELL I GUESS YOU UH GET THE IDEA
BEAUTIFUL
YES UM I HAVE SOME TECHNICAL UH ISSUES WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU UH BEFORE WE START THE DISCUSSION
BECAUSE UH THERE MIGHT BE SOME UH INFLUATIONS INFLUENCES
OKAY
OKAY
UM FIRST ABOUT MY ROLE ROLE OF THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ABOUT UH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UH OF THINGS AND THE TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES AND IMPOSSIBILITIES
SO IF SOMEONE OF YOU COMES UP WITH UH IDEAS UH I'LL TRY TO TRANSLATE THEM IN TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS BUT UH THERE MIGHT BE SOME IMPOSSIBILITIES
SO THAT'S ONE
UH I ALSO WILL PROPOSE SOME UH UM
UH SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR THAT BUT WELL THESE ARE QUITE THE SAME
SORRY ABOUT THAT
UM AND I ALSO WILL REMIND PEOPLE OF SOME NEW TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES WHICH ARE AVAILABLE AND WHICH MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO IMPLEMENT IN OUR PRODUCT
I HAVE SOME UH INITIAL IDEAS ABOUT SOME THINGS UM WHICH ARE MAYBE NICE TO TAKE WITH YOU IN THE UPCOMING UH DISCUSSION
ONE THING ABOUT UH INTEROPERA OPERABILITY
UM I THINK A MODERN UH REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD UH CONTROL A DEVICE DIVERSE SUBSET OF EQUIPMENT
UH FOR INSTANCE UH D. V. D. PLAYERS CELL PHONES VIDEO AND AUDIO EQUIPMENT
SO ONE RE UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL FOR ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT
WELL THERE SHOULD BE SOME INTEROPERABI INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN THEM
I THINK IT COULD COME IN HANDY
WE SHOULD DISCUSS THAT
UM AND WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE WAY HOW THESE THINGS UH SHOULD COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER
WE'RE NOT UH LIVING IN THE UH NINETEEN EIGHTIES ANYMORE SO INFRARED IS NOT UH
IS NOT REALLY UH HOT UH TECHNICAL STUFF ANYMORE
BUT YOU SHOULD UH THINK ABOUT THE THINGS LIKE UH BLUETOOTH
MM-HMM
BUT IT'S COST EFFECTIVE
YES
MM-HMM
WELL NOT ALL NOT ALL
SO THAT'S THE POINT
SO
MAYBE BUT THAT'S UH SOMETHING WE SHOULD DISCUSS AND UH ABOUT EVERY EVERYBODY SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT
SO THAT'S JUST MY ROLE I'LL JUST UH GIVE YOU UH EVERYBODY SOME TECHNICAL INPUT
AND I THINK NOW THE TIME IS TO HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT UH THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE AND HOW IT SHOULD LOOK
BUT TAKE THESE THINGS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN YOU START THE DISCUSSION
YES SO ONE THING UH ONE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD UH CONTROL ONE OR MORE UH PIECES OF EQUIPMENT AND THE WAY OF COMMUNICATING WITH THESE EQUIPMENTS
OKAY
THAT'S IT
YES I THINK IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE'RE NOT DEVELOPING THIS PRODUCT FOR A SPECIFIC VENDOR ARE WE
NO WE'RE JUST DEVELOPING THIS PRODUCT AND WE WANT TO SELL IT TO A VERY BROAD UH PUBLIC SO IT SHOULD FIT TO EVERY DEVICE
YEAH
MM-HMM
AND YOU YOU SEE UH THE BUTTONS AS A AS A MEANS OF DOING THIS
OR ARE THERE ANY O OTHER CONTROLS
ARE THERE ONLY ANY OTHER CONT
WELL I I'VE SEEN THESE REMOTE CONTROLS WITH UH THIS LITTLE STICK UH WHICH YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD SIDEWORDS
YOU KNOW THESE THINGS
AND UM IT'S VERY EASY FOR A USER TO TO SWITCH W YES
TO TO SWITCH B UH BETWEEN UH CHANNELS OR UH CHANGE UH BETWEEN TRACKS ON A ON A C. D.
ON ON A CHAPTERS YOU KNOW ON A D. V. D. PLAYER
SO MAYBE THAT'S AN IDEA I DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
UH IS THAT UH ARE THERE RESTRICTION FOR THE RANGE THE OPERATING RANGE TOO
SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO POINT AT THE DEVICE UM THE RANGE IS VERY LIMITED
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
DO DO YOU
UM WELL YES I HAD UH ABOUT THREE MINUTES AGO BUT I'VE SEEM TO FORGET THEM FORGOT THEM
UM OH YES I REMEMBER
UM YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT VISIBILITY IN THE DARK
UM
UH WOULD IT BE NICE FOR A USER TO HAVE DISPLAY ON THIS UH REMOTE CONTROL ON WHICH YOU CAN SEE FUNCTIONS
WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO OPERATE IT
I I DON'T KNOW
MM-HMM
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
YES BUT THERE'S A COST LIMITATION TOO
WELL THAT'S MORE
SO THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM I THINK
I THINK THE THE FINANCIAL PART OF THIS PROJECT UH IMPLICATES THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A HIGH HIGH END PRODUCT
THE COST PRICE IS VERY LOW
UM
OKAY
VERY GOOD POINT
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
HMM
IT'S USE UH A LOT OF UH WELL WELL CELL PHONES HAVE UH INTEGRATED BLUETOOTH ALSO AND WELL IT'S IT SEEMS TO WORK UH QUITE OKAY
SO UH TECHNICALLY IT WILL BE POSSIBLE
NO YOU CANNOT
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
GOOD MORNING
OKAY
UM GREEN
AN ANIMAL
OKAY
UM
UH A WEE RABBIT
YEAH
YEAH I THINK I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT YEAH
UH I THINK MOST MOST THINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAID LIKE UH CONTROL MULTIPLE DEVICES
AND UH YEAH INFRARED MIGHT BE AN ISSUE
UH WELL HE SAID ABOUT N ABO WHAT HE SAID ABOUT POINTING
BUT UH LOTS OF DEVICES ALREADY USE INFRARED
SO
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THAT
YEAH
WELCOME BACK
UH LET ME SEE
OKAY
ROO WELCOME BACK
THE WAITING IS FOR SEBASTIAN
THERE HE IS
SORRY
UH NO
YOU CAN'T SORRY
WELL THIS IS LIFE
SORRY UH ROO
OKAY
OKAY
PEOPLE WELCOME BACK WITH THE SECOND MEETING
UM FOR NOW ON THE SCHEDULE ARE A FEW POINTS
UH FIRST OF ALL THE OPENING WHICH WE ARE DOING NOW
UM SECOND I RECEIVED UM SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU RECEIVED THEM AS WELL UM BUT I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
UM THEN UM THE THREE OF YOU UH PREPARED A PRESENTATION I THINK
SEBASTIAN
ROO
RUUD
ALMOST OKAY
THEN WE'LL DO YOUR ONE UH UH AS LA UH THE LAST
UM THE TOP GOAL OF THIS M
UM WE WILL FIGURE THAT OUT
CA CAN YOU TRY TO
YEAH W WE WILL SEE
UM IT IS YEAH
YEAH
UM THE TOP GOAL OF THIS MEETING IS TO REACH A DECISION ON THE PRODUCT
ON THE TARGET GROUP UM AND AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL SO KEEP THAT IN MIND
UM
WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES
SO
IT'S NOW
YEP
OKAY
UM THE NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS FIRST OF ALL UM WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT BUT WE SHOULD NOT UM SUPPORT TELETEXT IN THE REMOTE
UM BECAUSE OUR B UM BOARD UH FEELS THAT UH TELETEXT IS OUT OF DATE AND INTERNET IS REPLACING TELETEXT
SO UM WE ARE NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY TO UM IMPLEMENT IT IN OUR PRODUCT
IT'S A BOARD DECISION
UM THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TELEVISION BECAUSE IT'S NOT UH F UH FEASIBLE
IT'S NOT UH W UH UH WE WE CANNOT MAKE IT BECAUSE OF THE TIME TO MARKET UM THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH
UH THE THIRD REQUIREMENT IS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS THAT ARE YOUNGER THAN UH FORTY
WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU UH RUUD AND AS WELL FOR UH ROO
BECAUSE THE PRODUCT SHOULD UM BE UH INTERESTING AND AND UH SHOULD BE BOUGHT BY PEOPLE YOUNGER THAN FORTY
UM
THEN FOR ROO AS WELL UH IMPORTANT THE CORPORATE IMAGE SHOULD BE RECOGNISABLE IN OUR PRODUCT
SO THE COLOUR COLOURS AND THE SLOGAN UM DO HAVE TO BE UH IN THE PRODUCT
IS THAT CLEAR
ANY QUESTIONS ON THESE
REQUIREMENTS
NO
OKAY
UM THE INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS I TH UM ROO OR SEBASTIAN WHO OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START
UH UH YEAH
OKAY GREAT
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH
UH-HUH
OKAY
UH RUUD DID YOU GET THAT
OKAY SO THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS
IN THE MARKET YEAH
YEAH OKAY W WE WILL S WE ALL UH
YEAH
OKAY
SEBASTIAN
NO IT'S NOT VISIBLE
YEAH
OKAY
SO IT'S FAIRLY EASY
OKAY
OKAY GOOD
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
BUT BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER UM TWO OR FOUR BUTTONS MAKES UH M MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN THE COSTS IF YOU ALREADY PLAN TO UH INCLUDE FANCY LIGHTNING TECHNIQUES
I GUESS
OKAY
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY RUUD
OKAY WELL WE AR WE ARE VERY CURIO CURIOUS TO WHAT THE MARKET UM WILL FEEL ABOUT SUCH A PRODUCT
SO ANY INCOME IS WELCOME
INPUT
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
WELL THAT'S INTERESTING
YEAH THAT'S DEFINITELY INTERESTING
IT UH IT SEPARATES OUR PRODUCT FROM OTHERS UH AS WELL
OKAY GO ON
OKAY
SO THAT'S WHAT THE MARKET TELLS US
YEP
OKAY
YEP
WELL MAYBE MAYBE LIKE CLAPPING IN YOUR HANDS LIKE UM TURNING ON AND OFF THE THE THE LIGHTS
REPORTS REP RESPEND RESPONSE TO IT
BUT UH TH
YEAH BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A A A A A HOME UM
OKAY
SO WHAT ABOUT THE CLAPPING TECHNIQUE
UM BECAUSE YOU SE
WELL YOU SEE IT A LOT IN IN LIGHT UH LIGHTNING UH UH
YEAH A PEAK
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
WELL UH
YEAH
YEAH M MAYBE UM W WE UH WE DO AGREE ON ON THE THING THAT THE REMOTE SHOULD HAVE SUCH A FUNCTION
IF IT'S POSSIBLE WITHIN THE COSTS AND ALL THAT KIND OF THINGS
UM MAYBE SEBASTIAN SHOULD HAVE UH A DETAILED LOOK LATER ON AND UM COME UP WITH A SOLUTION BECAUSE THAT'S HIS HIS FIELD OF EXPERTISE
MM-HMM
YEP
YEAH IT'S A DISTINCTION IN THE MARKET
IT'S A DIFFERENT EXACTLY
IT'S AN UNI AN UNIQUE FEATURE AND UM I THINK UM IT'S WORTH UM UH LOOKING AND AND PROBABLY MORE I INTERESTING THAN UH THAN THE LIGHTS
YEAH
YEAH
WELL UM ACCORDING TO RUUD UM PEOPLE DO NOT USE UM ALL THE EXTRA FEATURES VERY VERY OFTEN
SO
OKAY
OKAY
WELL WE WE DO HAVE A WISE BOARD SO I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT
YEAH
OKAY SO ON THE RELEVANCE SCALE UH THE CHANNEL SELECTION THE VOLUME SELECTION AND THE TELETEXT
WELL WE SKIP THAT
OKAY
NO
YEAH
UH UH UH I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR THE EASIER ONE
NO
YEAH
OKAY RUUD HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT
UH DO YOU AGREE DO YOU THINK THE MARKET WOULD WOULD RESPOND TO UH A SIMPLE
MM-HMM
MM YEAH
OKAY SO THIS IS IS KIND OF UH
YEAH
BUT BUT ARE WE NOT IN IN THE IN THE MANUAL UH I MEAN IF YOU HAVE FEW BUTTONS NO DISPLAY
UM I MEAN UH I GUESS IT'S L IT'S WORKING WITH WITH A SHIFT FUNCTIONS AND UM ONE BUTTON CAN UH
BUT BUT HOW DOES HOW DOES THE REMOTE UH REPORT UH R UH GIVE BACK TO THE USER W IN WHAT STATE IT IS
BECAUSE WE DO NOT IMPLEMENT UH A USER HISTORY
I KNOW BUT BUT IF WE USE UH LIKE A STICK FOR EXAMPLE UM
YEAH
UH AND WE COULD HAVE OTHER BUTTONS FOR THE FOR THE ADVANCED UH FUNCTIONS
YEAH DRAW DRAW IT ON THE BOARD
YEAH IT CAN BREAK DOWN
UH-HUH
OKAY YEAH
OKAY BUT W WE STILL WE'RE STILL IN THE QUESTION OF UH UM UH PUTTING IN ADVANCED OPTIONS
UM RUUD JUST TOLD US UM THE MARKET IS INTERESTED IN SOME ADVANCED UH NEW TECHNIQUES
UM HOWEVER UH KEEPING IT SIMPLE IS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COSTS AND ALL ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS
WE NEED TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN UH THE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES AND AND THE USER FRIENDLINESS
UM WELL FOR WE DO HAVE TO UH DECIDE THIS THIS MEETING
YEAH
WE NEED TO UM HAVE THE UH THE USER FUNCTION UH THE FUNCTIONS DECIDED AND UM
UH OUR TARGET AUDIENCE
UM WELL I DO NOT WANT A FULL UH IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO TO HAVE A FULL LIST BUT I WANT UM THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS
FOR EXAMPLE UH TH THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE VOLUME AND UH PROGRAMME SELECTING
WELL FOR EXAMPLE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
L HOW IS THE REMOTE GOING TO LOOK
NOT NOT IN THE USER INTERFACE BUT
YEAH
A BIT OF A SPLIT MODE
UH L LIKE YEAH
DUAL CHANNEL WATCH
OKAY WELL UM M MAYBE I SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN
UH RUUD UM WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME
MIELSEN BECAUSE I I WAS WRITING IT DOWN IN THE LAST UH MIELSEN
RIGHT
UM I PUT ALL THE MINUTES I MAKE INTO THE SHARED FOLDER

OKAY UM
OKAY SO SO UM UH
VOLUME
PROGRAMME
UH DUAL CHANNEL
UH
AND AND DO WE WANT UM
THE TEN DIGITS
YEAH
I AGREE ACTUALLY
BUT WE DO HAVE THIRTEEN DIFFERENT DUTCH CHANNELS
OFTEN
WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE ON THE ON THE LOOKS ON THE ON THE
YOU C YOU CAN D MAKE THEM VERY FANCY BY UM
I MEAN NOKIA THEY HAVE TEN DIGITS ON THEIR PHONES AND IT STILL LOOKS VERY FANCY
SO I'M I'M I DO NOT AGREE
UH
EXACTLY EXACTLY
OKAY SPEECH
YEAH
TO FIND YEAH
UH
IF IF WE WOULD UM DROP THE TEN DIGITS BUT KEEP THE PROGRAMME AND THE VOLUME BECAUSE MAYBE PEOPLE DO NOT ALWAYS WANT TO USE THEIR VOICE UM
YEAH
BUT WE DO FOCUS ON YOUNGER PEOPLE
WE D IT IT'S A BOARD UH DECISION
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY G GOOD
OKAY
MM
YEP

UM
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR UM MAYBE MAYBE YOU ALL HAVE TH UH THINGS NOT UM SPOKEN ABOUT YEAH BUT THAT ARE IMPORTANT
UH RUUD YOU YOU CAME UP WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH DATA
UH ARE THERE OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE MARKET WE SHOULD KNOW
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO ALTHOUGH WE ARE FOCUSSING ON YOUNGER PEOPLE UH TO MAKE IT UH PROFITABLE UH
PROFITABLE
WE WE YEAH WE STILL NEED TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT THE THE BIT OLDER PEOPLE
OKAY
O OKAY
UM ROO
NOTHING TO ADD
SEBASTIAN
YEAH
GREAT
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEP
YEAH AND THAT WAS THE MAIN ISSUE RIGHT
THE THE BOARD
YEAH
THE BOARD
NO IT'S TH YEAH
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND YEAH
IT SHOULDN'T BE A BIG ISSUE
OKAY
I'M NOT SURE HOW HOW WE'LL F UH DETERMINE THE COSTS I WILL HAVE A LOOK AT IT
MAYBE YOU WILL GET SOME INFORMATION ON THAT
UM I'M NOT SURE HOW HOW THAT
YEP
OKAY GREAT
UM
WELL I THINK WE'RE QUI QUITE DONE
UM FOR NOW WE WILL HAVE THE LUNCH BREAK
UM I'M DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE BREAK WILL BE BUT WE'LL FIND OUT
UM THEN WE WILL HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF TIME TO PERFORM OUR INDIVIDUAL WORK UH AND I'M SURE YOUR PERSONAL COACHES WILL UH ASSIST YOU WITH IT
UM I WILL PUT THE MINUTES I JUST MADE IN THE PROJECT DOCUMENTS FOLDER
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT UM WELL JUST DO
UM THE INTERFACE DESIGNER UM I WOULD LIKE TO THE NEXT MEETING I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE THE UH COMPONENTS CONCEPT
UH ROO UM FROM YOU I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
UH
I'M SORRY YEAH I'M SORRY
USER INTERFACE DESIGNER UH ROO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE USER INTERFACE C UH CONCEPT
AND UM
WELL I IT SHOULD BE EASY THAT'S W W WHAT WE CONCLUDED
IT SHOULD BE AN EASY INTERFACE WITH NOT SO MUCH BUTTONS
S JUST A A P A P A VOLUME AND A PROGRAMME ONE
AND UM
UM YEAH SOME SOME FANCY LIGHTS
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDED
NO NO NO WE DIDN'T BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE INTEGRATED YEAH IT'S OF COURSE IT'S USER INTERFACE
BUT UM I I WAS TALKING ABOUT REALLY THE DESIGN OF THE
NO
WE CAN DECIDE THE NEXT MEETING
YEP
YEAH
I GUESS ALL OF YOU HAVE I UPDATED INFO
I'M SURE THE MARKETING EXPERT WILL RECEIVE UH T UH YOU WILL DO SOME TREND WATCHING
AND I'M SURE THE MARKET WILL UM UH
UH WILL CHANGE ADAPT AND UM SO WE WILL SEE THAT
UM YEAH THAT'S IT FOR NOW
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CAN WE HAVE THE LUNCH
YEAH OKAY
GOOD
HELLO
THERE'S ONE OF MINE
HELLO FLORES
WE HAVE A SLIGHT PROBLEM
I OPENED UH THE C. D. ROM BOX UH GUYS
SO JUST CANCEL IT
YEAH I OPENED THE C. D. ROM BOX
ACCIDENTALLY
BUT IT'S ALRIGHT
MM-HMM
YEAH
BUT YOU CAN'T UPLOAD YOUR PRESENTATION FROM HERE I BELIEVE
OKAY
I DON'T THINK IT'S WIRELESS HERE
OR IT IS
YEAH
OKAY GREAT
YEAH
TIME YEAH
YES
YEAH I'LL START
UM
OH HOW CAN I UH
GEEZ AND SLI AND SHOW
UM
JUST UH PRESS IT
UH YES
ALRIGHT
UM WELL W WE UH WE HAD DISCUSSED THIS ALREADY IN THE FIN IN THE PREVIOUS UH DISCUSSION
UH THE METHOD OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS JUST THE FUNCTION OF REMOTE CONTROL IS BASICALLY TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE TELEVISION SET
SO THAT WAS
THE MAIN UH IMPORTANT THING WHAT A REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD DO
THEN I FOUND UH TWO DIFFERENT KIND OF REMOTE CONTROLS THE MULTI FUNCTION UH REMOTE CONTROL WITH MANY POSSIBILITIES
BUT UM THE LACK OF THE FEELING I ALREADY MENTIONED UH IN THE PREVIOUS UH DISCUSSION
AND THE EASE OF USE REMOTE CONTROL WITH UH THE LESS P POSSIBILITIES BUT A GREAT FEELING IN IN TOUCHING THE BUTTONS
UM BUT UM YEAH
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES WERE EASE OF UH THE EASY TO USE REMOTE CONTROL BECAUSE UH THE USER FRIENDLINESS AND UH IT CAN BE MORE TRENDY IN IN USER DESIGN
BUT UM YOUR NEW GOAL F WAS FOR UH PEOPLE THAN LESS THAN FORTY YEARS OLD
SO MAYBE UM THE MULTI FUNCTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN UH IN OUR DESIGN
BUT IT SHOULD B I THINK IT SHOULD BE A COMBINATION BUT TELETEXT BUTTONS ARE NOT UH IN OUR DESIGN
SO IT SHOULD UH
TAKE OUT WELL EIGHT BUTTONS OR SO
BUT MY IN MY OPINION THE THE EASY TO USE R. C. IS UH THE BEST UH POSSI POSSIBILITY FOR US
YEAH
AND IT'S ALSO I INDEED UH UH RUUD'S UH INSIGHT IN THE IN THE TOPIC
YEAH WHAT WHAT DOES THE MARKET WANT
I I DON'T KNOW
JUST FOR UH FOR USER DESI UH USER UH FRIENDLINESS I UH SHOULD CHOOSE FOR THE THE EASE OF USE REMOTE CONTROL
SCUSI
ENERGIES AND UH
YEAH
THE GLOW IN THE DARK UH CONCEPT UH WE DISCUSSED
SUCCEED IN IT ALSO
AND WHAT'S THE UM IF WE USE THE LEDS I DOES IT USE MUCH MORE ENERGY OR
OKAY
FOR THE SAME COSTS IT'S CAN BE UH IN OUR
COMBINED WITH THE LOW COST CIRCUIT BOARD SO IT'S UH
YEAH
BUT I THINK
YEAH I THINK IT'S THE SAME AS IN THE CELL PHONE JUST LIGHT IN IN THE DEVICE THAT THAT SHINES ON ALL THE BUTTONS AND NOT FOR
YEAH BUT NOT FOR EACH BUTTON ONE LED I THINK
COULD YOU STEP A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE RIGHT
YEAH THANK YOU
YEAH
SOUND SIGNAL
YEAH
THE VOLUME AND UH THE ZAP BUTTONS ARE THE MOSTLY USED
SO
YEAH WELL IT SHOULD JUST HAVE A DESIGN
THE PERFECT DESIGN FOR THOSE ONLY THOSE BUTTONS
AND FIRST UM
YEAH
YEAH THE SOUND SIGNAL
JUST ONE THING I'M JUST WONDERING THE SOUND SIGNAL FROM WHERE DO YOU EXECUTE TH THE S SOUND
ANOTHER DEVICE IS NOT A SOLUTION
IT SHOULD BE UH UH
YEAH BUT MAYBE YOU'LL UH GET SOME NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR IT
YEAH JUST LIKE UH THE PHONES THE
BUT BUT T. V. S DON'T HAVE ALL UH
UH BUTTONS
UH
BUT I BELIEVE YOU WILL HAVE AN
I'M CONVINCED UH SEBASTIAN WILL UH FIND UH ONE SOLUTION FOR US
BUT WE CAN HAVE JUST UH UH A HOME STAT UH F A BASE STATION NEXT TO THE T. V.
JUST A LITTLE ANTENNA OR UH SOMETHING
WELL IF YOU LOST TH I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD BOTHER WALKING TO THE T. V. AND PRESS THAT BUTTON BECAUSE THEY LOST THE THEIR REMOTE
UH THAT'S JUST UH
JUST A BASE STATION NEXT TO THE T. V. IS THE BEST POSSIBILITY
YEAH
AND DO WE EVEN UH PREFER THE SOUND ABOVE THE THE LEDS THE LIGHTNING UH
FUNCTION
IT'S A UNIQUE ITEM UH
IT WILL BE AN A UNIQUE FEATURE OF OUR REMOTE CONTROL
YEAH
AND JUST ABOUT UH THE USER INTERFACE I CAME UP WITH UM AN EASY REMOTE CONTROL AND AN ADVANCED REMOTE CONTROL
WHAT SHOULD WE CHOOSE IN IN DESIGN
WELL THE EXTRA FUNCTIONS
USED OPTION
WELL SO IT JUST TH THE BASIC FUNCTIONS
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO USE IT FOR D. V. D. PLAYERS UH AND ALL KIND OF STUFF
SO
YEAH
JUST THROUGH UH THE EASY UH DESIGN
WE CAN MAKE UH A NICE DESIGN WHEN WHEN THERE'S NOT MU UH MUCH BUTTONS IN IT
SO
UH JUST A FEW BUTTONS TRENDY DESIGN NICE LIGHTNING EFFECTS WH AND THE SOUND
YEAH I DON'T KNOW YET
BUT DOES IT UH I THEN SHOULD N JUST USE UH I INSTEAD OF THE STICK
UH LIKE MANY CELL PHONES JUST A ROUND M WELL SHOULD WE JUST USE A
UM IT'S ALREADY UH OH WE HAVE A BLANK
OH
IT'S JUST AN EASY UH WAY OF OF A ROUND BUTTON WHAT WHICH CAN BE PUSHED IN FOUR DIRECTIONS
INSTEAD OF A STICK
A STICK IS V VULNERAB VULNERABLE
WHEN IT'S FALLING DOWN OR UH JUST A ROUND UH BUTTON SHOULD BE THE TRICK I THINK
YEAH
GEEZ
WELL VOLUME AND
SOMETHING UH
LIKE THAT
THE PROGRAMME UP AND DOWN
AND THE VOL YEAH THE PEN DOESN'T UH REALLY DOES WHAT I WANT
BUT I THINK OUR OUR NEXT STEP TO LOOK AT IS JUST THAT
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S UM WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
UH WE CAN'T DISCUSS IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE N NO ONE OF US HAVE HAS THE INFORMATION TO DISCUSS ABOUT THAT
I THINK
YES
MM-HMM
'KAY BUT TELETEXT IS SO UH IS JUST SCRAPPED
THE TEN DIGITS
OH AND JUST ONE FUNCTION
THE THE THE THE PROGRAMME TO PROGRAMME BUTTON THE SWITCH TO UH TWO CHANNELS
WHEN YOU HAVE UH SOMETHING ON CHANNEL FOUR AND SOMETHING ON CHANNEL SIX JUST ONE BUTTON WHICH WHICH CAN UH CHANGE YEAH
YEAH
ALRIGHT
OUR B. S. C. UH W. UH
THE TEN DIGITS
YEAH I BELIEVE SO
YEAH
I WOULDN'T BUY IT PERSONALLY
A REMOTE CONTROL WITHOUT THE TEN DIGITS
UH AND I THINK THE MOST
JUST ELDER ELDER PEOPLE WOULD WOULD BUY IT BUT
YEP
THE OLDER PEOPLE ONLY USE FIVE OF THEM
YEAH
ON THE DESIGN
YEAH
YEAH
SO WE HAVE TO I TO MAKE UM A DECISION BETWEEN THE TEN DIGITS OR THE VOICE RECOGNITION
MM-HMM
TWELVE DOLLAR FIFTY
I HAVE NOTHING UH NOTHING TO ADD I THINK
BUT THE CHEAPER THE CH UH THE THE CHIP OR TH WHAT WAS IT
THE CIRCUIT BOARD
THE FEWER BUTTONS YOU CAN USE ON IT
YEAH OKAY
YEAH
WELL IT THEN WE SHOULD JUST UH TAKE A LOOK AT THE COSTS AND UH ESPECIALLY FOR THE VOICE RECOGNITION
NO
WE'RE DONE I THINK
ME NEITHER
INTERFACE INDUSTRIAL
YEAH
UH THE ONLY PROBLEM IS IT THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE DIVISIONS THE DECIS UH DECISIONS SEBASTIAN MAKES
ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION
WELL
YEAH
YEP
ADAPT
THAT'S IT
'KAY
I'LL TAKE THE LUNCH
IS THERE ANY TIME FOR A CUP OF COFFEE
CAN I GET A CUP OF COFFEE
OKAY
WELL DURING MY WORK I HAVE NO TIME EITHER
SO
I THINK SO TOO
IT IS
IT IS
YES
OKAY
EXCUSE ME
UM
OKAY IT'S STILL THE RIGHT THING
OKAY
UM WELL THERE ARE SOME CHANGES IN THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS SO THERE ARE SOME CHANGES IN THE METHOD ALSO
UM BASICALLY ALL THIS DEVICE HAS TO DO IS SEND MESSAGES TO A T. V. SET
AND THE M MOST EASY WAY TO DO THIS IS BY UH SENDING PULSES OF INFRARED LIGHT TO A T. V. SET
WELL I TH I TRIED TO UH IMPLEMENT A PICTURE HERE BUT IT'S HARDLY READABLE
CAN YOU SEE IT
NO
WELL
UM THERE'S A ENERGY SOURCE HERE
AND UM BASICALLY THERE IT'S CONNECTED TO THREE THINGS
THE USER INTERFACE CONNECTED TO A CHIP WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE SENDER WHICH GENERATES MESSAGES USING UH INFRARED LIGHT WHICH ARE SENT TO THE RECEIVER
THAT'S BASICALLY THE IDEA
AND THERE'S A LITTLE PICTURE JUST FOR YOUR IMAGINATION HOW A DEVICE LIKE THIS SHOULD LOOK OR CAN LOOK
OKAY
UM WHAT HAVE I FOUND
USUALLY THESE KIND OF THINGS CONSIST OF A BATTERY INFRARED DIODE BUTTONS CHIPS AND CIRCUIT BOARD
THAT'S ALL
IT'S CASED TOGETHER NOTHING MORE THAN THAT
IT'S ALMOST EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT UM
EVERY PIECE OF UH EVERY T. V. SET IS CONTROLLED INFRARED
THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS BUT MOST OF ALL HAVE UH INFRARED CONTROLS
AND UH THE MORE LUXURY UH REMOTE CONTROLS HAVE LITHIUM BUTTONS
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE W YES
IN THE AND IT'S A LITTLE MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE FANCY ALSO
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT
OKAY
I HAVE A BASIC SCHEME OF THE THINGS UH WHICH ARE IMPLEMENTED
UM BASICALLY THIS IS ALL THERE IS
THERE'S JUST ONE CHIP
THERE ARE A FEW BUTTONS CONNECTED
UH THE BUTTONS ARE LIT
AND THE WHOLE THING IS TRANSMITTED BY A INFRARED LI DIODE AND THERE IS NOT A POWER SOURCE HERE
SO THAT'S BASICALLY THE TOTAL DESIGN OF THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO IT
IT'S FAIRLY EASY
IT'S BEEN DONE MANY TIMES BEFORE AND I THINK WE SHOULD UH WE SHOULD C S SUCCEED IN IN OUR PLAN TO DO THIS
SO
OKAY SO UH PERSONALLY I THINK WE SHOULD INFRA USE INFRARED BECAUSE UH OTHERWISE OUR DEVICE CANNOT UH COMMUNICATE WITH UH ALMOST EVERY T. V. SET
SO I THINK THAT UH SHOULD BE CLEAR
UH ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT IS UH WE REALLY SHOULD USE UH ENERGY UH SPARSE FRIENDLY COMPONENTS
UH THERE ARE SPECIALLY UH DESIGNED UM ENERGY FRIENDLY COMPONENTS WHICH CONSUME UH FAR LESS POWER THAN UH CONVENTIONAL COMPONENTS
AND UM IF WE WANT TO USE UH A RECHARGEABLE DESIGN OR UH A ENERGY SAVE DESIGN WE SHOULD REALLY IMPLEMENT THEM
UM FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS WE SHOULD REALLY USE A VERY LOW COST UH CIRCUIT BOARD
UM BECAUSE MOST OF THE PRODUCTION COST ARE ARE IN THIS UH PART OF THE EQUIPMENT
AND UM THE MONEY WE SAVE ON USING THIS WE CAN USE UH FOR ELABORATE FANCY LIGHTING UH TECHNIQUES BLINKING LEDS AND ALL THAT KIND OF FANCY STUFF
I THINK OUR UH USERS WILL REALLY UH WILL REALLY LIKE THAT
NO THEY'RE P F UH POWER FRIENDLY LEDS ALSO
SO WE CAN USE THEM
SO THAT'S NO PROBLEM
UH NO THEY'RE UH THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE BUT BY UH UM UM MAKING
WE CAN WE CAN MAKE ITS I THINK
OKAY
HMM
YES
WELL IT'S NOT ONE LIGHT IT THERE ARE MORE LIGHTS IN A IN A IN A MOBILE DEVICE
NO NO NO NO
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
SO WELL THIS UH SHOULD BE IT
UM HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT
MM
OR A FIND A FINDING FUNCTION YOU KNOW
THAT'S QUITE A YES
YES
YES
YES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT I GUESS
WELL THE TECHNICAL UH THERE I THINK THERE ARE NO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES
THERE'S NO UM ELABORATE TECHNIQUE UH USED IN THIS UH KIND OF EQUIPMENT
SO UM I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY HICCUPS THERE
SO WE CAN FULLY CONCENTRATE ON DEVELOPING A PRODUCT THAT IS REALLY UM WHAT THE MARKET NEEDS
SO MAYBE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO THINK ABOUT THESE BUTTONS AND AND UH AND A SOUND SIGNAL
WELL
YES
TH THAT'S A BIT OF THAT'S A PROBLEM
USUALLY
OH YES
YES
WELL THERE THERE ARE SOME DEVICES WHO UH INCORPORATE THIS TECHNIQUE ALREADY
UM THERE ARE VIDEO SETS AND UM THEY HAVE A SPECIAL BUTTON THE FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL BUTTON
YOU PRESS IT AND YOUR T. V. SET STARTS TO MAKE A UH KIND OF WEIRD SOUND AND YOUR UH REMOTE CONTROLS THEN START TO BEEP
AND UM
YES
YES THAT'S IT
YES SAME THING
NO SO WE WE SHOULD USE SOMETHING ELSE
WE DO NOT CONTROL THE T. V. SET SO WELL
YES M YES
S AND WE B WE WANT TO MAKE SO IT'S IS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
IT'S QUITE COMPLICATED
WELL IT'S QUITE COMPLICATED
BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU SEPARATE THE CLAPPING SOUND FROM OTHER SOUNDS
YES YES
WELL BASICALLY THE CHARACTERISTICS UH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CLAPPING IS JUST AN INCREASE IN THE VOLUME
THE AMPLITUDE OF THE SOUND WHICH IS UH GENERATED A FEW TIMES WITHIN A UH CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME
BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER SOUNDS UH WHICH ARE EXACTLY THE SAME FROM THE POINT OF VIEW FROM A REMOTE CONTROL
YES SO WE DON'T WANT THAT
MAYBE WE CAN
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL IS THERE NOT SOMETHING F SOMETHING MORE EASILY
WELL I DON'T THINK UH
NO
AND Y THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR PEOPLE IS THAT THERE'S A CENTRAL POINT TO WHICH THEY CAN GO AND UH B UH PERFORM A A SOME KIND OF UH
AND THEN UH THE REMOTE CONTROL UH REPORTS ITSELF SO W WE SHOULD USE HAVE UH WE SHOULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU DO NOT WANT ANOTHER DEVICE WHICH CAN BE UH EVERYWHERE IN THE HOUSE WHICH YOU HAVE TO FIND FIRST BEFORE YOU CAN FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
YES SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT THAT WILL BE VERY COSTLY I THINK
SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA
MM-HMM
I WILL
YES
YES
BUT UM BEFORE I DO THAT I W I WANT TO WARN YOU THAT UH BY IMPLEMENTING THIS KIND OF A FUNCTION THE TECHNICAL DESIGN WILL BECOME MORE COMPLICATED UM AND IT WILL BECOME MORE COSTLY ALSO
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS WHICH WHICH UH WILL BE USED
AND THERE ARE SOME IMPLEPE IMP
WELL I I THINK SO BECAUSE UM WHEN YOU HAVE A P NEWSPAPER OVER YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU CANNOT SEE IT
SO
OKAY
NO NO
SO THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION
SO
I THINK ALSO
YES
WELL
WE SHOULD SAVE COSTS UH BY NOT IMPLEMENTING A LOT OF FUNCTIONS AND UH THE MONEY THAT WE CAN SAVE FROM THAT WE SHOULD USE FOR UH HAVING A NICE DESIGN AND UH THINKING ABOUT THE USER INTERFACE AND
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
MM
OKAY
WELL IS IT MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY
YOU CAN MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AN EASY S PIECE OF EQUIPMENT BUT IT'S QUITE ELABORATED UH BECAUSE IT HAS MANY FUNCTIONS
MAYBE IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A VERY UH FRIENDLY EASY TO CATCH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT BUT UM NEVERTHELESS
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OK LIKE THAT
WELL I WAS MORE THINKING ABOUT A MORE ELABORATE WAY OF CONTROLLING BY BY THESE KINDS OF STICKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I DON'T KNOW IF IF IT'S USER FRIENDLY
THAT'S YOUR FIELD OF EXPERTISE
MM-HMM
THERE'S NO BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE CANNOT IMPLEMENT THAT KIND OF THE SYSTEM
W
MM-HMM
WELL MAYBE WE CAN USE A LIGHT FOR THAT
WHEN YOU MOVE THE STICK TO A TO A POSITION MAYBE UH A LIGHT NEXT TO IT CAN LIT UP
SO YOU KNOW I'VE JUST UH PUSHED THE BUTTON OR I CHANGED THE CHANNEL OR T UH TURNED UP THE VOLUME
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YES
OH YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT'S NOT REALLY A STICK BUT
YES
YES
HMM
YES YES
AND
YES AND THIS ALSO LOOKS MORE FANCY I THINK
I THINK IT IT WILL ATTRACT UH
MORE UH UH PUBLIC I THINK
BUT YOU'RE THE MARKETING MAN
OKAY THAT'S GOOD
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
DO DO YOU WANT A LIST OF FUNCTIONS
DO YOU WANT AN EXPLICIT LIST
UH WHICH UH INCORPORATES ALL FUNCTION AVAILABLE ON THE DEVICE
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES
CHANGE
YES YES
YES
WELL YOU'RE THE SECRETARY
MM OKAY BUT MAKE A S MAKE A SUB FOLDER FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S STARTING TO FILL UP ALREADY
SURE
YES THAT'S IMPORTANT
WELL ARE ARE YOU SURE
I'M NOT SO SURE
WELL THAT'S COMPLICATED BUT IS THAT SO RELEVANT
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK BUT YOU SHOULD UH SHOU YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
IF IT WERE SO
OKAY I CAN IMAGINE WHEN
I CAN IMAGINE WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU HAVE A SATELLITE DECODER AND AND YOU HAVE WELL ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CHANNELS I CAN IMAGINE YOU WANT THIS
BUT IF YOU'RE UH A REGULAR T. V. USER AND YOU JUST WANT UH TO WATCH THE THE DUTCH TELEVISION NETWORKS
WELL YOU CAN UH YOU CAN USE UH ABOUT TEN BUTTONS
THAT'S ENOUGH
WELL BUT HOW HOW OFTEN DO YOU WATCH ALL THESE CHANNELS
NO YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
OKAY
BUT I THINK THESE UH TEN UH BUTTONS LOOK A BIT DULL
DON'T YOU THINK
THE DESIGN
OKAY
WELL Y THEN THERE SHOULD BE SHOULD DONE BE DONE SOMETHING SPECIFIC WITH IT
MM-HMM
OKAY SO YOU CAN EXPERIMENT BY UH WITH WITH SHAPE OR WITH SIZE OR WITH COLOUR THAT KIND OF THING
OKAY
WELL MAYBE IT CAN BE COMBINED WITH THE FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO UM WHEN YOU ADD UH SPEECH RECOGNITION TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL UH IT'S VERY EASY TO CHANGE UH THE CHANNEL
THAT'S ONE THING
AND IT'S VERY EASY UH TO FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
SO MAYBE THAT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT I'M AFRAID IT WILL BE A BIT COSTLY
BUT MAYBE WHEN WE UH
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
OKAY
WELL
I I THINK IT SHOULD UH SHOULD WORK IT SH WE SHOULD MANAGE THAT
YES
WELL THE VOICE RECOGNITION HAS THE MAIN ADVA HAS ANOTHER ADVANTAGE
IT'S MAS IT MAKES IT VERY EASY FOR US TO IMPLEMENT THE FIND UH FIND THE REMOTE CONTROL BUTTON UH REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTION
SO THAT'S THAT'S A BIG ADVANTAGE I THINK
THERE'S ONLY ONE DISADVANTAGE UH BY IMPLEMENTING THIS
UM THE POWER SAVING POWER SAVING WILL BE A BIT MORE DIFFICULT
SO WE CAN EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE A LESS LONGER LIFE TO THE BATTERIES
BUT MAYBE CAN WE WE CAN THINK SOMETHING SMART ABOUT IT
THERE ARE SOME UH HYBRID HYBRID DEVICES WHICH INCORPORATE A SOLAR PANEL AND RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
SO WHEN YOU JUST LEAVE THE DEVICE IN A IN A LIGHT ROOM IT CHARGES ITSELF
YOU HAVE TO DO NOTHING FOR IT
MAYBE MAYBE NOT
I'LL HAVE TO FIND THAT OUT
YES
SO
NO THAT'S VERY CHEAP
IT'S OH IT'S VERY CHEAP
THAT'S NO PROBLEM
IT'S JUST A A CASE WITH TWO UH METAL CONTACTS
IT'S
YES BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE MASS PRODUCTION
THEY'RE VERY CHEAP
SO IT WILL COST US P PRACTICALLY NOTHING
YEAH
PROFITABLE
UM I JUST WANT TO MAKE A SUMMARY OF ALL ALL THINGS UH SPOKEN AND UH THE DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES
UM
SO UH BASICALLY WE'VE DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT A SEEMINGLY UH EASY DESIGN
SO ON THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKS EASY BUT UH WE CAN MAKE IT EASY ON THE INSIDE OR ELABORATE ON THE INSIDE
SO THAT'S ONE THE THOSE ARE THE CHOICES WE HAVE TO MAKE
BUT I THINK THERE'S A BIG ADVANTAGE IN MAKING IT MORE ELABORATE BY UH IMPLEMENTING UH SPEECH TECHNIQUES UH VOICE RECOGNITION THAT THESE KINDS OF THINGS
UM IT MAKES IT ALSO MORE UH ATTRACTABLE I THINK TO OUR UH AUDIENCE
UM THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES AND SOME DISADVANTAGES AND THE MAIN ADVANTAGE IS THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT UH FANCY TECHNIQUES WHICH UH I THINK OUR CUSTOMERS WILL LIKE
THE DISADVANTAGE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT UH THE THE COSTS AND UM THE THINGS LIKE UH BATTERY LIFETIME ENERGY SAVING
UH ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS THAT THE CIRCUIT BOARD WILL BECOME MUCH MORE EASIER IF WE DO NOT DO NOT IMPLEMENT THESE BUTTONS
IF WE JUST ADD UH UH A CHIP WHICH DOES THE VOICE RECOGNITION UH OUR CIRCUIT BOARD WILL BECOME EVEN MORE CHEAP
SO THAT'S ANOTHER WELL IT WA IT W IT WAS AN ISSUE BUT WE ALSO THOUGHT THAT WE ALREADY THOUGHT WE SHOULD DO IT AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE
AND THIS EVEN UH MAKES IT MORE CHEAPY
SO
MM-HMM
THE CIRCUIT BOARD
THE FEWER BUTTONS YOU HAVE THE CH CH THE CHEAPER THE CIRCUIT BOARD YES
AND IT'S VERY CHEAP UH TO INCORPORATE UH UH AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT A CHIP
SO THAT'S
THAT'S ANOTHER ADVANTAGE
SO
YES BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
YES
I D I REALLY DON'T KNOW
SO
IT CAN BE COSTLY
MAYBE NOT
YES
YES I AL I I HOPE MY PERSONAL COACH WILL UH HAVE A LO UH LOOK AT IT
HOW NICE
WELL WE UNDERSTAND
WELL
MM YES
SO WE DROP THE VOICE RECOGNITION
OR OH
OKAY
WELL UM DO WE REALLY HAVE TO DECIDE NOW OR CAN WE DECIDE NEXT MEETING
OKAY
BECAUSE I'LL HAVE SOME UPDATED INFO ON THAT UH
ADAPT
WE CAN HAVE THE LUNCH
HELLO
ALMOST
UH IF IT IF IT IF IT'S WIRELESS I COULD JUST UH PUT IT IN THE
UH OKAY
YEAH UH B UH MOST
OH USER FRIENDLY
WELL YOU COULD ONLY LIT UH THE BUTTONS THE BUTTONS THAT ARE USED MOST
SO THE CHANNEL SWITCHING
OR
HMM TRUE
OH MINE IS ALREADY OUTDATED
SINCE UH
OKAY MAKE
WELL
UH THEN I'M SURE THE TARGET MARKET IS UH TEN MILLION UNITS
OF OF WHICH WE SHOULD SELL ABOUT UH FORTY PERCENT TO MAKE THE FIVE MILLION
BUT UM SINCE UH THE OTHER PART IS UH FORTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET I UH THOUGHT EARLIER WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSTRAIN THAT PORTION OF THE MARKET
BUT UH SINCE UH THE REQUIREMENTS CHANGED THAT'S UH NOT A GOOD IDEA
UH WELL SKIP THIS
WELL IT'S THIS TILL TRUE OF COURSE
THAT THEY ONLY USE TEN PERCENT THE BUTTONS
THE BUTTONS TO ZAP ARE USED THE ABOUT UH FIFTEEN HUNDRED TIMES WHEN UH THE POWER BUTTON IS ONLY USED ONE TIME
AND THE VOLUME BUTTON'S ONLY FOUR TIMES
SO THEY'RE OBV OBVIOUSLY UH THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS
AND UH LOTS OF PEOPLE COMPLAINED THEY KIN CAN'T FIND THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE MIGHT WANT TO BUILD IN A FEATURE TO UH SUPPORT THEM
SOME UH AUDIO SIGNAL
LIKE UH HOME PHONES
OR
YEAH
WELL I JUST SAID THAT
AND UH WELL THIS OBVIOUS AND HE ALSO SAID IT
UH THAT'S ABOUT IT YES
UH MO UH ZAP BUTTONS MOST
VOLUME THEY ARE UH USE A LOT
BUT
MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER BUTTONS
SO
YEAH THAT'S UH A PROBLEM
YEAH
YEAH
AND YOU
YEAH AND USUALLY
AND EVEN IF THE T. V. SET WOULD HAVE SUCH A BUTTON UH YOU WOULD HAVE TO WALK TO YOUR T. V. AND IT'S
AND B
SO IF IF YOU'D BE WATCHING A MOVIE IT WOULD CONSTANTLY BEEP
YEAH
YEAH
I HAVE THE NUMBERS R I HAVE THE NUMBERS RIGHT HERE
WELL T UH WE WON'T SUPPORT TELETEXT WHICH WHICH WAS THE THIRD MOST THE SECOND MOST USED FUNCTION
UH WELL YEAH CHANNEL SELECTION IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
SO
YEAH
YEAH
SO
NOPE
UH WELL IF WE UM INCLUDE OTHER UH INNOVATIVE
FUNCTIONS UH THEN THEY UH MIGHT 'CAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE UH LIKE NEW FEATURES
SO
AND IF YOU USE THAT STICK FOR VOLUME CONTROL AND CHANNEL UH SELECTION YOU HAVE THE M TWO MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IN ONE UH BUTTON
YEAH
A YOUNGER UH-HUH
AND IT'S ALSO QUITE EASY TO USE SO IT'LL IT UH ATTRACT YOUNGER PEOPLE BECAUSE WELL NEW AND IT MIGHT ATTRACT OLDER PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO USE
MIELSEN
YEAH
WELL IF YOU WANT TO GO TO CHANNEL NINETY AND YOU HAVE TH THAT BUTTON
WELL
BUT
YEAH AND IF IF WE
AND IF WE ARE TARGETING AT THE YOUNGER AUDIENCE THEY WILL PROBABLY WATCH MORE CHANNELS THAN THE OLDER PEOPLE
SO
WELL
AND
AND UM THERE ARE SOME NUMBERS ABOUT UH SPEECH RECOGNITION HERE THAT UH YOUNGER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT
UH IT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE AND UH HARD TO IMPLEMENT BUT IT WOULD BE A SOLUTION UH
FOR
YEAH
ESPECIALLY ELDER PEOPLE UH DON'T LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION
SO THEN WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT SUCH A BUT
YES
M
AND UH IF WE IF WE COULD INC UH INCLUDE A C A CRADLE IN WHICH IT COULD RECHARGE
THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE UH A BIG PROBLEM
'CAUSE WHEN
YEAH
UM I THINK WE DEALT WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION
JUST THAT THE YOUNGER PART OF UH THE MARKET ISN'T THE FORTY PERCENT WE UH
WANT TO SELL TO
SO WE WE SHOULD UH FOR LEAST A BIT UH LOOK AT THE UH OLDER PEOPLE
BUT WITH UH BUTTONS LIKE THAT WHICH ARE EASY TO USE WE UH MIGHT ATTRACT THEM TOO
SO
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM
YES
YEAH PROFITABLE
YES
HMM
LEFT
HMM
YEAH
DO YOU NEED TO CHANGE ANYTHING ON IT
BECAUSE OTHERWISE I WILL ALREADY OPEN IT
OKAY
IS IT MUCH CHANGES
UH I DIDN'T NO NO
I DO HOT HAVE
ONLY THE SAME INFORMATION
HELLO SEBASTIAN
I BELIEVE UH MISS UH TENTEL IS WITH US AS WELL IN THE CONTROL ROOM
OH IT'S THAT ROO AGAIN ALWAYS LATE
BONGIORNO
HMM
I SEE SOME INTERESTING OKAY
PEOPLE WELCOME BACK
THE THIRD MEETING
UM I HAVE SOME POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO UH SOME SOME ISSUES I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT
UM FIRST OF ALL UM IF YOU MAKE MINUTES YOURSELF AS WELL UH LIKE SEBASTIAN DOES UM COULD YOU PUT THEM ON THE SHARED FOLDER
IF YOU DO NOT MAKE MINUTES NO PROBLEM BUT IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SEE WHAT YOU UH WROTE DOWN
SO I COULD UH CAN UH UM USE THAT IN THE IN THE REPORT
UM THE SECOND THING UM
I WAS TH UH S THINKING TO MYSELF I HAVE THIS LITTLE REMOTE CONTROL
AND I'M TALKING TO IT BUT I STILL NEED TO POINT TO THE TELEVISION BECAUSE IT WORKS WITH INFRARED
THAT'S QUITE STRANGE
OKAY
WE'LL COME TO THAT LATER I G I THINK
UM THE AGENDA FOR NOW UH UH ARE THERE ANY PRE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
OKAY
UM WE WI WE WILL HAVE YOUR INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS UH THEN THE DECISION ON THE REMOTE CONTROL CONCEPT UM AND UH THE CLOSING
FORTY MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR THIS
SO UM I THINK WE WE CAN IMMEDIS IMMEDIATELY START WITH THE INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS UM THE PROGRESS YOU'VE MADE
UM I THINK IT MIGHT BE SMART TO LOOK AT UH RUUD'S UM INFORMATION FIRST BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD THERE ARE SOME UH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MARKET SITUATION
UM YEAH
UH W WAIT A SEC WAIT A SE UH COULD YOU GO TO THE PREVIOUS SLIDE
UM BECAUSE I'M TAKING MINUTES AND IT
UM WERE THE IMPORTANT THEMES ENCLOSE
YEAH OKAY
THE FEEL OF TO BE SPONGY
OKAY SO SO YEAH IT MIGHT NOT BE T UH IT IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD
IT IT MAYBE IT RUBBER OR OR YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
WELL THAT'S INTERESTING
YOU COULD MAKE A FEW V VERY COLOURFUL ONES AND UH A VERY TRADITIONAL CO COVER
YEAH YEAH
YEAH IT IS IT IS I YEAH
YEAH
DO YOU KNOW THE PHONE
IT'S THE SIEMENS UH C. TWENTY FIVE I BELIEVE IT'S IT'S THE ONE THE POST BANK UH GAVE AWAY THE VERY
YOU KN YOU KNOW RUUD AS WELL
ABOUT TH
OKAY
OKAY
UM UH OKAY
DO YOU HAVE UH THIT THAT WAS OKAY
OKAY SO THE THE M UH IMPORTANT FINDINGS ARE UH INNOVATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EASE OF USE FOR THE OUR TARGET GROUP
AND UM COLOURING IS IMPORTANT AND AND UH SOFT MATERIALS
OKAY
OKAY ROO
COULD YOU DO YOUR PRESENTATION
OKAY WELL IT'S GOOD TO TO SUM UP UH THE THINGS WE ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT
SHAPE
YEAH
AND WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT MAYBE UM WE SHOULD MAKE VERY LIGHT BUT UM UH A GRIP UM I MEAN THIS IS HOW YOU HOLD A REMOTE CONTROL
UM IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO UH GLATT TOO SLIPPERY S BECAUSE UM
YEAH
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH
YEAH EX FOR YOUR FINGERS YEAH
YEAH
IT GRIPS AUTOMATICALLY
YEAH OKAY
OKAY GOOD
YEAH
WAY TOO MUCH I THINK FOR OUR GOAL YEAH
OKAY B BUT I THINK WE'LL YEAH
OKAY
WELL IT WOULD BE VERY NEW TO THE MARKET BUT
YEAH
I THINK UM IF IF I CAN HOOK ON TO THAT UM THE KINETIC THING IS VERY FUNNY
I MEAN SOLAR IS OF COURSE IT'S NICE BUT IT'S WELL YOUR UH YOUR CALCULATOR HAS A SOLAR PANEL
UM HAND DYNAMO
WELL MAYBE M
YEAH I KNOW
YEAH
YEAH
AND WHA
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY BECAUSE I GUESS THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE U CONSUMES QUITE A F UH A LOT OF POWER
YEAH
OKAY
WELL
THIS WILL BE THE REMOTE RIGHT
UM WITH UH MAYBE A CHANNEL SELECTOR
WHAT ABOUT
INTEGRATING A SCROLL BAR ON THIS SIDE
BECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU KEEP IT
VOLUME
WELL WHAT ABOUT MUTE
THI I I M I GUESS UH TH THIS IS MY VOLUME BUTTON
AND I CAN EITHER ON THIS SIDE OR THIS SIDE UM
AND CLICK IT TO MUTEN THE DEVICE
AND AND IT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM THE TRADITIONAL UH DEVICES ON THIS MARKET
SO I'M LOOKING FOR A WAY TO
UH MAKE IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE TRADITIONAL ONES
SO MAYBE UM I GUESS THAT THAT'S SOMETHING YOU TWO UH NEED TO THINK ABOUT
UH RUUD WHA WHAT DO YOU THING ABOUT UH A SCROLL BAR
UH SCROLL WHEEL
OKAY
YEAH
WELL ALL THE SONY TELEPHONES USE IT FOR EXAMPLE FOR VOLUME
NOKIA HAS A WELL OKAY IT'S NOT REALLY A SCROLL WHEEL
BUT ON THEIR SIDE TH THE THE VOLUME BUTTON IS ON THE SIDE BECAUSE YOU GRI GRAB IT LIKE THIS
YEAH
I KNOW IT'S NOT REALLY A SCROLL WHEEL
NO
YEAH
FOR YOU TOO YEAH
OKAY
SEBASTIAN
UM
YEAH
IT PERFORMS THE ACTION
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UH WELL UH D DID WE ALREADY DECIDE ON THE DISPLAY
TO
NO
ON SCREEN DISPLAY
YEAH
OKAY TH
OKAY
GOOD
KINETI OKAY
OKAY IT'S MAYBE A BIT TOO TOO FLASHY TOO YEAH
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S THE SAME WITH THE SOLAR CELL
THAT'S NO DIFFERENT
YEAH
OKAY
NO NO BUT THE UH UM THAT'S WHAT SEBASTIAN SAID
HE SAID UH THIS IS WHAT UH THIS IS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE
BUT BUT YET I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MARKET IS DIFFERENT
SO UM
NO R RUBBER WITH COLOURS
COLOURFUL AND
YEAH
BUT BUT DO WE WANT THE CURVED UH UH DESIGN OR
I IT'S TOO DULL
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY WHAT ABOUT UM THE ISSUE I UM ADDRESSED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING
UM THE VOICE FUNCTION W WITH THE INFRARED UH ISSUE
BECAUSE IT IT'S OF COUR
YEAH
WELL
IT DEPENDS ALSO ON YOUR ON YOUR
WELL IT DEPENDS ON YOUR WALLS ACTUALLY
IF YOU HAVE UH HAVE UM SMOOTH WALLS IT IT IT PROBABLY YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
BUT IF YOU HAVE CARPETS ON THE WALL WHICH OUR NATURAL LOVING FRIENDS PROBABLY DO HAVE
THEN UM YEAH TH TH IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE OF A ISSUE
SO
YEAH
I LIKE THE SCROLL WHEELS UH IDEA
YEAH
WELL IT LOOKS UH YEAH WELL UM ACCORDING TO RUUD THE THE THE MARKET LIKES UM NEW FLASHY TECHNOLOGY
AND I MEAN L. C. D. IS WELL OK I KNOW BUT IT'S M IT'S LESS UM S STANDARD THAN THAN
WELL WE ARE NOT VERY W WE DO NOT KNOW UH MUCH ABOUT THE THE F THE FINANCIAL PART
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
BECAUSE IF WE DO HAVE ENOUGH UM SPACE IN IN OUR FINANCE I WOULD SAY DO INTEGRATE IT BECAUSE
IT IT ADDS A LITTLE EXT EXTRA HIGH TECH FEELING TO IT
MM YEAH
OKAY OKAY
YEAH
OKAY I I AGREE
I THINK I RUUD DO YOU HAVE ANY UM ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO
UM ADD OR OR MAYBE THOUGHTS OR
NO
SEBAST UH NEE ROO
ROO DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER
NOTHING MORE
UM
SEBAS
WELL WE WE NEED TO DESCRIBE UH DECISIONS NOW
SO UM ON THE ENERGY WELL WE DECIDED
CHIP
THE CASE UH RUBBER WITH UH C ONE ONE UH ONE CURVE
USER INTERFACE UM
UM THEN THE CORPORATE IDENTITY SHOULD BE UH IN THE PRODUCT
I GUESS THAT IS SOMETHING FOR ROO AND SEBASTIAN
UH YOU TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE THE COLOURS GREY AND YELLOW
KEEP IT IN MIND
AND UM THE BUTTONS WELL WE TALKED ABOUT IT NOW
THE NEXT PHASE UM SEBASTIAN UM IS UM THE DESIGN OF THE LOOK AND FEEL
THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN
AND FOR YOU THE PRODUCT EVALUATION
UM I'M SURE YOUR PERSONAL COACH WILL GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THAT
UM AND UH THE I. D. AND THE U. I. D. NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE PROTOTYPE DRAWING ON THE SMARTBOARD
AND I'M GOING UH TO PLAN MY HOLIDAYS
YEAH IT'S IT'S UH WHEN WE COME BACK IN THIRTY MINUTES UH YOU WILL HAVE A UH PROTOTYPE READY
YEAH
I CAN
UM MAYBE ONE OF YOU COULD WRITE IT DOWN
GREAT
UM
UH YOU YOU NEED TO HELP ME
UM
THE CASING IS CURVED SINGLE CURVED
TRADITIONAL BATTERIES UH AND SOLAR
NO THEY CAN BE COMPLEMENTARY
UH AL AL I UH
EVERY DEVICE
YEAH
OKAY UM TH
BATTERY AND SOLAR YEAH
YEAH WITH COLOURFUL RUBBER
UH IF IT'S POSSIBLE WITH UH DIFFERENT UM COVERS BUT I'M NOT SURE IF OUR SUPPLIERS CAN UH CAN HELP US WITH UH WITH SUCH UH UH A WISH
UH GREY AND YELLOW OR BLACK AND YELLOW
YEAH
YEAH ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY COLOURFUL
EXCEPT FOR THE YELLOW OF COURSE BUT UM I COULD THINK OF A MORE UH ATTRACTIVE UH C UH SET OF COLOURS
WELL I WAS MORE THINKING ABOUT THE FRUIT COLOURS THAT THE RUUD SHOWED US BEFORE
WELL IT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RED
UH I MEAN TH UH I THINK THESE COLOURS ARE REALLY WHAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR
UM SO MAYBE IT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE TWO COLOURS
IT SHOULD BE A FULL COLOUR COVER WITH SUCH AN IMAGE OR OR I MEAN THINKING IN TWO COLOURS IS IS TOO BLACK AND WHITE FOR OUR M UH C UH MARKET GROUP
I GUESS
BLACK AND YELLOW YEAH
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH WH WHAT'S POSSIBLE HERE
YEAH
OKAY
UM MORE F MORE MORE DECISIONS WE MADE
UM
UM
THE SCROLL HEEL
YES THE VOICE RECOGNITION WE ALREADY DECIDED
YEAH
UH I'M GOING TO LEAVE THAT UP TO YOU TWO
YEAH
I THINK RUBBER IS NICE
BECAUSE IT UH I I MEAN WHAT DO YOU TOUCH THE BUTTON AND WHAT DO THEY WANT SPONGY UH UH DEVICES OR OR I
UH IS THAT UH DOES OUR OUR SUPPLIER SAY SO
YEAH
YOU COULD PLACE A UM UH THIS THIS WOULD BE THE BUTTON
THE SCROLL WHEEL I MEAN
AND YOU COULD PLACE
THE INDICA TH TH THE SIGNALS THE
NO NO THERE'S NO PAINTING ONLY UH YELLOW OR
BUT IT'S INTO THE RUBBER
YEAH BUT THIS IS ON THE PLA YEAH I KNOW
UM I THINK UH I KNOW WHICH YOU UNDERSTAND AF UH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
WHAT ABOUT UM MAKING THIS RUBBER
AND MAKING THIS PLASTIC
YEAH
WELL ACTUALLY WE SHOULD HAVE IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND I GUESS
A PLASTIC COVER WITH RUBBER FINISHING
I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS THE FINISHING
THIS IS UM WHAT'S ON THE EDGE
WHAT YOU FEEL
BUT THE FRONT
ON WHICH THE THE BUTTONS ARE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RUBBER
I MEAN
I KNOW BUT DO YOU TOUCH THIS OR DO YOU TOUCH THIS
I MEAN I I NEVER TOUCH BETWEEN THE BUTTONS
YEAH THE SIDE EXACTLY THE SIDEWAYS
THE SIDE BUT DO YOU TOUCH BETWEEN THE THE THESE BUTTONS
OKAY
WELL WE DO NOT HAVE VERY MUCH TIME UH LEFT
UM I GUESS YOU TWO HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT
I'M GOING TO LEAVE THE DECISION TO YOU UM BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE ITS PROTOTYPE
AND UM YEAH Y YOU HAVE THE MOST KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SUPPLIERS THE POSSIBILITIES AND UH SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT THE DECISION WITH YOU
UM SEBASTIAN DID YOU WRITE ENOUGH DECISIONS DOWN
YEAH
OKAY
WITH THOSE REGULAR CHIPS WE CAN STILL UH CONTROL ADVANCED FUNCTIONS
THE CHIP IS IS NOT REALLY
OKAY WELL
YEAH
OKAY
UM OKAY THEN I THINK WE ARE UH QUITE FINISHED
UM I'LL SEE YOU GUYS IN THIRTY MINUTES AND UM
YEAH
YEAH UM IF YOU WRITE WROTE ANYTHING DOWN UH COULD YOU PUT IT ON THE SHARED FOLDER
YEAH
I KNOW BUT WELL
GREAT
RIGHT
BONGIORNO
PUNISH
YOU WISH
WELCOME
UH
YEAH
NO
ALRIGHT
BUT THEY LIKE DARK COLOURS YOU SAID IN THE P
OKAY
WELL THEN I SUGGEST THAT THE CORPORATE COLOURS ARE GREY AND YELLOW
I HAD
OR WE COULD MAKE OH
YEAH O O
I'M THINKING ABOUT UH THE BANANARAMA TELEPHONE UH TELEPHONE FROM UH SIEMENS
THE YELLOW UH RUBBER TELEPHONE
IT'S THE IT'S THE RUBBER UH
COVER
AND IT'S UH COLOURFUL
IT LOOKS LIKES A BANANA
WE HAVE THE FRUIT WE HAVE THE COLOURS
WE HAVE THE SIMPLE DESIGN
UM THIRTY FIVE
AND THE B THE LIGHT BLUE AND IT'S ALSO IN YELLOW
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL I DON'T HA REALLY HAVE MUCH TO ADD UM BECAUSE MOST OF THINGS WE ALREADY SAID IN UH
THE PREVIOUS UH DISCUSSION
UM
UH THE PREVIOUS IDEAS WERE VOICE RECOGNITION AND UH THE ROUND BUTTON FOR UH THE P CHANNEL PROGRAMMING AND UH VOLUME
WELL A FEW INTERFACE I UH I FOUND ON THE INTERNET ARE ARE THESE
THESE ARE BOTH WITH UH WITH VOICE RECOGNITION BUT THEY'RE VERY ADVANCED AND VERY HIGH TECH AND JUST UM WELL A WEIRD UM
SHAPE
SO I SUGGEST I COULDN'T UH I HAD A SMALL UH MOCK UP UH SIGN ON THE ON PAPER
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK
MY PEN DIDN'T LOAD UM THE INFORMATION
SO I MADE A REALLY SIMPLE F UH A SHAPE ON UH IN UM
POWERPOINT
BUT WE COULD MAKE UH A ROUND UH AN OVAL UH UM REMOTE CONTROL
UH YELLOW
BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE UH THE SIEMENS PHONE IT'S RUBBER
SO IT'S EASY IN YOUR HAND UH INDEED
YEAH
GREAT
OH AND UM TO ADD ON UM RUUD'S INFORMATION IN THIS UM INTERFACE WE CAN HAVE UH HIGH TECH WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND UH
WELL THE THE FANCY COLOURS AND UH AND SO ON AND STILL HAVE THE EASE OF USE BECAUSE WE HAVE AN EASY INTERFACE
AND ALL THE OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS ARE HIGH TECH IN BUTTONS AND UH AND SO ON
YEAH
SO IF YOU HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION YOU CAN YOU CAN PROGRAMME LIKE THIRTY UH UM
THIRTY C UH CONTROLS ON IT
YEAH
RIGHT
GREAT
LIKE THE WATCH
BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE HOW MANY TIMES UH YOU TAKE THE THE REMOTE CONTROL AND AND IF UH IF YOU HAVE A WATCH
YOU HAVE THE KINETIC UH IDEA IN A WATCH ALSO
YOU YOU WALK AND UH BUT UH YOU YOU'RE SITTING ON A COUCH
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OH WE CAN JUST MAKE FOUR PUSH BUTTONS IN A FORM OF A ROUND
BUT I TH I DON'T THINK UH THE SCROLL WHEELS I HAD SOME I HAD SOME INFORMATION ABOUT IT TOO
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY FOR US TO USE SCROLL WHEELS
I D I CAN'T SEE UH ANY UH SCENARIO WHERE YOU WOULD USE A SCROLL WHEEL WITH A BUTTON ON IT
YEAH
YEAH UH THAT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT
BUT FLORES
THINK ABOUT A SCENARIO WHERE Y WHERE YOU WOULD USE THE SCROLL BUTTON FOR
A VOLUME OKAY
YEAH
WHEEL
YEAH I BELIEVE UH IF YOU HAVE UH WHAT WE'VE EARLIER SAID UM THE GRIP UH PLACES IN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
YOU HAVE YOUR HAND ON ONE PLACE ON THE REMOTE CONTROL SO YOU HAVE TO PLACE ALL THE BUTTONS IN A RANGE OF YOUR THUMB
SO IN THAT CASE UH THE VOLUME BUTTON ON THE SIDE UH OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE PERFECT
YEAH YEAH YOU CAN UM I HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT IT
UH IN THE VOICE RECOGNITION YOU SAY A WORD YOU CAN PROGRAMME WORDS LIKE UH V UH VOLUME UP
OF MUTE LET'S SAY MUTE
UM YOU PROGRAMME IT
YOU M MUTE AND YOU G YOU GIVE UM AN UH AN ACTION TO IT THAT THAT'S REALLY THE MUTE FUNCTION AND UH WHEN YOU SPEAK IN THE THE REMOTE CONTROL
IT REPEATS UH YOUR SAYING
SO THAT'S THE SAMPLE SENSOR
SO IF YOU SAY MUTE IT SAYS MUTE AGAIN AND THEN IT'S UM WELL I BELIEVE IT'S UH
YEAH AND THEN UH HE HE REPEATS ITS ACTION WHAT WHICH HE BELIEVES IT IS
SO YOU SAY MUTE HE REPEATS MUTE AND YOU MAKES A COMPUTER SOUND MUTE AND THEN GOES TO THE MUTE FUNCTION
YEAH
WELL I DON'T HAVE UM I HAVEN'T LOOKED FOR UH FOR INFORMATION ABOUT IT
BUT I DON'T THINK INFORMATION UH Y I DON'T THINK YOU NEED IT ON A DISPLAY
ESPECIALLY WHEN WHEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A COST
I DON'T THINK UH 'CAUSE UH UH ALL ANY T. V. CAN UH CAN UH VIEW A DIGIT ON UH ON SCREEN YEAH
BUT WHAT ABOUT UM THE MARKETS
UH WANTS COLOURFULS
UH DESIGNS
SO IF YOU USE TITANIUM
OKAY
OH SORRY
YEAH
YEAH
AND I WOULD THINK
AND THEY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITH A REGULAR CHIP
OKAY BUT WE ALSO UH WE ALREADY NEED THE REGULAR CHIP FOR THE SAMPLE UH SENSOR SPEAKER OH EVALU
BUT MOST INFRARED UH REMOTE CONTROLS DON'T HAVE TO BE POINTED AT ALL
WELL IF YOU IF YOU TAKE YOUR HAND BEFORE IT OKAY IT WON'T WORK BUT YOU CAN POINT IT JUST TO THE OTHER WALL
YEAH
AND THE REGULAR CHIP
AND AND THE SCROLL UH SCROLL WHEELS
YEAH
NO
THINK SO TOO
BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE SCROLL WHEELS THE SP UH THE SPEAKER UH THE SPEAK RECOGNITION THE RUBBER
THE FANCY COLOURS
UM NO
NOTHING MORE
UH BUT UH CAN'T SCROLL WHEELS UH WORK WITH ONE UH ONE CURVED CASE
YEAH OKAY
SORRY YEAH
OH SORRY
YEAH
YEAH
THE PROJECT DRAWING IS FOR THE NEXT
YEAH RIGHT
SINGLE CURVED
BUT CAN THERE BE UH WOR CAN THEY WORK TOGETHER
OR DO WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM
'CAUSE IF WE HAVE TO CHOOSE YEAH
OKAY
WHAT IF NOT
OKAY
YEAH
GREY AND YELLOW
YELLOW CASE AND GREY BUTTONS I THINK
I BELIEVE THE
BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY UM YOU MUST HAVE A RED UH ON AND OFF BUTTON
AND UM
WELL WELL
WELL THERE IS
JUST A WEEK AGO A KEYBOARD MANUFACTURER WOULD PRINT WITH AND UH
NO
A SCROLL WHEEL
VOICE RECOGNITION OF COURSE
WHAT WHAT DID YOU SAY
YEAH
YEAH OR YOU COULD USE PLASTIC BUTTONS
IN THE RUBBER
YEAH B
BUT THEN YOU JUST HAVE THE THE FACT THAT UM THE DRAWINGS ON THE BUTTONS WILL DISAPPEAR EVENTUALLY
WHAT I SAID IN THE IN THE FIRST UH DISCUSSION UH THE DIGIT SIX ON THE BUTTON IT WILL DISAPPEAR WHEN IT'S FROM RUBBER
IT IS NOT UH SOMETHING UH IT'S NO INFORMATION I READ ABOUT IT OR SO BUT IT'S JUST FROM
NO BUT BUT UH IT
YEAH B YEAH
YEAH THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT THEN YOU HAVE STILL THE IMAGES ON THE RUBBER OF THE CASE
SO STILL THEN IF YOU FEEL UH LI UH IF YOU FEEL YOUR REMOTE CONTROL YOU JUST RUB ON THE COVER SO YOU RUB ON THE PAINTING
YEAH
YEAH BUT BUT THE THE PLUS OR THE MINUS
YOU HAVE TO DRAW THE
YEAH IT'S ON THE COVER
SO IF YOU UH
YOU JUST MOVE THE PROBLEM
Y UH CAN YOU SEPARATE THESE UH THESE
I DO
OR THE S UH THE SIDEWAYS
OR THE THE BACK
OR THE BACK
I THINK
YES ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE L A FEW BUTTONS ON IT YOU HAVE UH A LOT OF SPACE TO TOUCH
SO YOU JUST HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND COMPLETELY OR OR I YOU PLAY WITH IT
YEAH
YEAH
REGULAR
USE WITH
FOR THE FINISHING TOUCH
UH YEAH
BUT UM
SEBASTIAN HAS EVERYTHING
HELLO HELLO MISTER P. M.
WELL THAT'S WHERE THE THINKING GOES ON
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUNISH HIM
YOU'RE THE P. M.
POSSIBILITIES YEAH
YES
SO
NOT AT ALL
OKAY
JUST PRESS THE OKAY BUTTON IT WORKS
HOW SURPRISING
OH WAIT UH WAIT UP
UH SO DO YOU THINK UM WHEN FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE IMPORTANT FOR CLOTHING AND SHOES THAT THEY ARE IN REMOTE CONTROLS ALSO
NOT SOMETHING DULL
OKAY
BUT CAN YOU CAN YOU GO BACK TO THAT SLIDE
THE UH JUST ONE SLIDE BACK NO NO NO
YES
OKAY AND THE FEEL OF THE MATERIAL HAS TO BE SPONGY
HAS IT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT UH NATURAL FEELING ALSO DO YOU THINK
OKAY
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING
YES
I DON'T KNOW THE PHONE BUT I CAN IMAGINE IT
OH THAT ONE YES
NOW I KN UH OH I KNOW I KNOW
YES I I'VE SEEN IT
I'VE SEEN IT
SO SO EASE OF USE IS IMPORTANT BUT TECHNOLOGY IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT
AND WHAT WAS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
OKAY
SO THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR OUR CUSTOMERS
MM-HMM
BUT IT'S IT'S KIND OF UH IT'S KIND OF O ORGANIC SO THAT'S VERY GOOD
YES
SLIPPERY
YOU HAVE TO GRAB IT
YES
THERE ARE THERE ARE ALSO REMOTE CONTROLS WHO HAVE UH A LITTLE SHAPE UNDERNEATH WHERE YOU CAN PUT YOUR FINGERS IN
SO YOU CAN GET A REALLY GOOD GRIP ON IT
SO YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO UM ATTAIN MUCH PRESSURE TO IT
IT'S IT'S A LOT EASIER
SO M
YES
BUT I'LL I'LL GO INTO THAT DEEPER IN MY PRESENTATION
OKAY BUT I'LL I'LL GO INTO THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE ARE SOME POSSIBILITIES AND SOME IMPOSSIBILITIES
UM I HAD A TALK WITH UH OUR MANUFACTURING UH DIVISION AND UH WE HAD A TALK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS UM WHO ARE IN THIS DESIGN
UH THESE ARE THE THINGS WE'VE LOOKED AT
AND OF COURSE I USED THE WEB TO UH FIND MY INFORMATION
ABOUT THE CASING WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT CASING POSSIBILITIES
WE HAVE THE UNCURVED OR FLAT CASE
UH THAT'S THE MOST COMMON UH REMOTE CON CONTROL FORM UH WE'RE USED TO IS JUST A IT JU IT'S JUST A BOX
I'M SORRY I I DON'T HAVE ANY PICTURES OF UH OF THIS THING
WE HAVE UH A CURVED ONE
IT'S UH CURVED IN TWO DIMENSIONS
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IT'S A BIT LIKE A WAVE FORM
SO IT'S UH A LITTLE MORE ADVANCED IN ITS IN ITS SHAPE
UH AND WE HAVE AN EVEN MORE ADVANCED UH SHAPE WHICH IS CURVED IN THREE DIMENSION
I C I THINK YOU CAN COMPARE IT A LITTLE BIT WITH THE UH BIG GREY IMAGE UH YOU HAD IN YOUR PRESENTATION
THE THE BIG REMOTE CONTROL SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT IT'S QUITE UH ADVANCED AND IT'S
IT'S QUITE DARING TO TO USE I THINK
UM FOR THESE CASINGS WE HAVE UH DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINISHING
WE CAN USE PLASTIC WHICH IS UH VERY SLIPPERY AND MAYBE NOT SO NICE
BUT YOU CAN GIVE IT ANY COLOUR UH WHICH IS THE SAME FOR RUBBER BUT IT'S NOT SLIPPERY
WE CAN USE WOOD AND TITANIUM
WELL UM WE CANNOT USE THE TITANIUM ON THE DOUBLE CURVE CASES
AND THESE LATEX CASES THERE'S THERE'S JUST THE PLASTIC ONES UH WON'T ALLOW THE USE OF SOLAR CELLS AS AN ENERGY SOURCE SOURCE
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE DIFFERENT ENERGY SOURCES
UM WELL WE EVEN SEEM TO HAVE UH HAND DYN DYNAMOS FOR UH POWERING OUR UH REMOTE CONTROLS
YOU REALLY HAVE TO IMAGINE LIKE WINDING UP YOUR UH I D
IT WOULD BE VERY NEW BUT IT'S A KIND OF A RETRO UH STYLE I THINK
UH WELL THIS IS QUITE INTERESTING
UH THERE'S THERE'S ALSO A KINETIC ENERGY SUPPLY
SO UM WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. UH OR WHEN YOU'RE YOU YOU HAVE TO UM MAKE SOME KIND OF ENERGY KINETIC ENERGY BY SHAKING THE REMOTE OR THROWING IT AGAINST THE WALL
WHATEVER YOU WISH
IT HAVE IT IT HAS TO MOVE THAT'S THE THE SENSE OF IT
AND YOU CAN STORE THE ENERGY IN THE IN THE THING
MM-HMM
IT'S VERY FUNNY INDEED
MM-HMM
INDEED
MM-HMM
YES
BUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW FROM YOUR OWN WATCH YOUR WATCH USES UH A MINIMAL CON IT CONSUMES A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF ENERGY
THE THE SHAKING OF YOUR BODY WHICH IS ALMOST UH EVERY ACTIVITY MAKES YOUR UH BODY SHAKE UH IT CHARGES IT
BUT UH THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IT IT SUPPLIES A A VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF KINETIC ENERGY
SO I THINK UH YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVIE AND UH YOU HAVEN'T MOVED THE REMOTE UH I REMOTE CONTROL IN A IN AN AMOUNT OF TIME
AND YOU WANT T TO SWITCH UH THE CHANNEL OR SOMETHING WELL M IT MIGHT NOT WORK
SO THAT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND
SO BUT MAYBE MAYBE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY COM TO COMBINE IT WITH M UH TRADITIONAL BATTERIES
SO WE CAN SAVE ON THE BATTERIES AND UM WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH KINET KINETIC ENERGY USE THE KINETIC ENERGY AND OTHERWISE USE THE BATTERIES
UH YES IT DOES
I'LL COME TO THAT LATER
AND WE OF COURSE HAVE THE TRADITIONAL UH SOLAR POWER
WHICH IS JUST UH UH UH UH UH A PIECE OF MATERIAL ON THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH TRANSFERS LIGHT ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY
THE USER INTERFACE CONTROLS UM OF COURSE WE HAVE THE PUSH BUTTONS AND UH WE ALSO HAVE SCROLL WHEELS
AND THESE SCROLL WHEELS CAN ALSO BE INTEGRATED WITH BUTTONS
SO IT'S JUST LIKE A MOUSE
YOU CAN SCROLL 'EM YOU CAN ALSO PUSH IT
UM UH IN THE INDICATORS WE HAVE THE L. C. D. DISPLAYS
WHICH MEANS UH YOU CAN WATCH UH IN A DISPLAY W WHICH CHANNEL YOU HAVE CHOSEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF THE LI AMOUNT OF VOLUME WHICH IS UH CURRENTLY UH AND WE ALSO HAVE DOUBLE SCROLL BUTTONS
WHICH ARE JUST TWO OF THESE THINGS
SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE THE KIND OF BUTTON WE HAD IN MIND IN OUR UH UH IN OUR LAST MEETING
THE THE THING WITH THE THE ROUND WITH THE FOUR
YES
THAT IS POSSIBLE TOO
YES
MM-HMM
WELL MAYB UH WELL M ME NEITHER
MAYBE WHEN YOU INTEGRATE SOME FUNCTIONS
UH IT'S DO IT'S DONE BEFORE
YES
IT'S QUITE QUITE GOOD YES
WELL IT'S IT WELL I WHAT HE MEANS IS THERE'S AN BUTTON INTEGRATED IN THE SCROLL WHEEL
THERE'S NO SCENARIO WHERE YOU USE UH THE BUTTON IN THE SCROLL WHEEL
YOU JUST USE THE WHEEL
ABOUT MUTE
WELL YES
OKAY
YES
WELL OKAY
WELL THAT THAT THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY OKAY
WELL OKAY
IT'S QUITE GOODS
MM-HMM
YES
HMM
BUT IT'S DONE BEFORE UH THERE ARE MANY OTHER DEVICES UM LIKE UH TELEPHONES AND OUR UH RADIO POCKET RADIOS
WE USE THIS
AND
WELL IT'S IT'S BEEN DONE YEARS AGO AND I DON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE NOW
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT NO
HMM
YES BUT IT USES TWO SEPARATE BUTTONS
IT DOESN'T USE A
WELL
UH SOMETHING FOR UH ROO HERE
WI WITHIN REACH
YES YOU HAVE TO
YES
YES
YEAH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY UM WE HAVE TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO USE UH THESE RUBBER DOUBLE CURVED C UH CASE UM YOU MUST USE THESE PUSH UH PUSH BUTTONS
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN INTEGRATE L. C. D. DISPLAYS
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN INTEGRATE SCROLL WHEELS BECAUSE IT'S ALL CURVED
THERE'S THERE ARE NO UH FLAT AREAS WHERE YOU CAN INCORPORATE THESE THINGS
SO THAT'S A LIMITATION
ABOUT UM THE COMPONENTS UH JUST THE HARDWARE
WE BASICALLY HAVE UH THREE TYPES OF CHIPS WE CAN USE AND UH THESE CHIPS INCORPORATE ALL THE LOGICA AND UM UM UH HARDWARE THAT IS NEEDED TO SEND UH TO SEND A SIGNAL
UH WE HAVE A SIMPLE REGULAR AND ADVANCED CHIP
AND THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE A SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER WHICH IS A LITTLE CRYPTIC UH TO ME
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING THAT WE ARE UH THINKING ABOUT
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
SO SO OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY SO THAT'S BASICALLY THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION ITEM WE WERE SEARCHING FOR
OKAY
THIS SAMPLE SENSOR UH REQUIRES AN REGULAR CHIP I THOUGHT
UM NO OP I'M NOT VERY SURE
NO IT'S NOT IN HERE
IF WE WANT TO USE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY WE REALLY NEED THE ADVANCED VERSION WHICH IS A BIT L LITTLE BIT MORE COSTLY
IF WE WANT TO USE THE SCROLL WHEELS WE NEED THE REGULAR VERSION
AND IF WE DON'T WANT TO USE UH ANY OF THESE UH MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS WE CAN KEEP WITH THE SIMPLE UH CHIP WHICH IS A BIT CHEAPER
OKAY
UM NO BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING FOR UH ROO HERE
TO THINK ABOUT
I I DON'T THINK EITHER
NO
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED IT
OKAY
OKAY WELL MY CONCLUSION UM UNFORTUNATELY THE MARKET HAS DECIDED THE A LITTLE UH OTHER THAN I THOUGHT
I THOUGHT UM THE MARKET WOULD LIKE UH A SORT M SORT OF TITANIUM CASING BUT THEY SEEM TO LIKE NATURAL UH STUFF
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT UH WOOD FINISH
UM I'VE CHOSEN THE MORE BATTERY WITH SOLAR CELL UH SOLUTION FOR THE ENERGY
IT'S MORE RELIABLE IT'S CHEAPER
SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD USE THE DYNAMO THING
THE KINETIC THING IT IT'S IT'S A POSSIBILITY
IT'S IT'S MORE ADVANCED BUT I'M I THINK YOU SHOULD COMBINE IT WITH BATTERIES
OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT TOO ADVANCED UH WELL
IT'S IN IN IN SOME WAY IT CAN GIVE US AN ADVANCE BECAUSE YOU WILL SAVE ON YOUR BATTERIES
BUT
YES
AND I THINK IT'S MORE ROBUST
IT'S MORE UH
UH IT'S MORE FUNCTIONAL
THE TITANIUM THING UH
WE HAVE TO SKIP IT
SO I THINK WE SHOULD SKIP THE TITANIUM UH STUFF AND WE SHOULD UH USE WOOD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
OH OKAY SORRY
SO IT IT NEEDS TO BE RUBBER
OKAY
OKAY SPONGY MATERIALS
OKAY UM WELL UM THESE SCROLL WHEELS I THINK UH THEY THEY CAN BE THEY CAN BE HANDY
SO
YES THEY CAN
BUT THEY REALLY NEED THE REGULAR CHIP YOU CANNOT USE THE SA SIMPLE
WELL I'M NOT VERY SURE
MAYBE THAT'S AN UH A DIFFERENT
I THINK SO IF YOU IF YOU STICK WITH THE THE SIMPLE UH STRAIGHT FORWARD UH NOT CURVE DESIGN I UH IT'S TOO DULL
I DON'T THINK C OUR CUSTOMERS WILL LIKE IT
AND UM IF YOU UH TAKE THE DOUBLE CURVED UH THEN YOU CANNOT UM YOU CAN ONLY USE THE RUBBER BUTTONS AND YOU CANNOT USE THE SCROLL WHEELS
SO I THINK THIS IS THE BEST OF TWO WORLDS
YES
IT'S IT'S UH I UH I CAN IMAGINE IT'S VERY DULL TO TALK TO A DEVICE W IF YOU HAVE TO POINT TO ANOTHER DEVICE
IT'S VERY UNLOGICAL
WELL THE THERE HAS TO BE SOME POINTING AT
BUT
ALL LIGHTS GET ABSORBED YEAH
YES BECAUSE THE WALLS THEY THEY REFLECT THE INFRARED LIGHT
SO IT HAS AN IT'S EASIER
UM I SUGGEST WE USE THE THE SENSOR SAMPLE
UH THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SAMPLE SPEAKER
UM WITH A WITH A REGULAR CHIP
I THINK UH IT GIVES US THE ADVANTAGE OF
YES YES
AND UH SKIP AND SKIP THE L. C. D. PART
I DON'T THINK IT IT'S ANY UH VALUE ADDED THING
SO
OKAY
TECHNOLOGY
YES
IT'S NOT VERY FLASHY AND NEW
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES
UH I THINK OUR CUSTOMERS WILL GO INSANE
IT'S IT'S TOO MUCH
OKAY
UH THE N THE NEXT PHASE WILL BE UM
THE UM NOT THE WHAT IS THE NEXT PHASE F FLORES
OKAY
SO I
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY OKAY
YES THEY CAN WORK
THEY CANNOT WORK WITH DOUBLE CURVED
THAT'S THAT'S PROBLEM
I'LL CHECK IT FOR YOU
YES
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
SO YOU WILL BE ON THE BAHAMAS
UH
OKAY
SO CAN YOU UH GIVE US A SUMMARY OF ALL UH DECISIONS WE'VE MADE
I'LL DO
OKAY
W START WITH THE CASING
OKAY SINGLE CURVED CASE
OKAY
WHAT ABOUT THE ENERGY SOURCE
I I THINK THEY CAN
YES
WELL UH
IT IT SHOULD BE
THERE SHOULD BE REALLY NO PROBLEM
THEY CAN BE SUPPLEMENTARY
THAT'S NO PROBLEM
SO
SO UH UH JUST UH THE ENERGY SOURCE IS UM THE BATTERIES AND THE SOLAR
OKAY
WHAT ABOUT UH THE FINISHING OF THE CASE
WE HAVE DECIDED WE WANTED TO USE THE RUBBER
OKAY AND I THINK WE SHOULD USE THE COMPANY COLOURS
SOMETHING LIKE BLACK AND RED
UH BLACK AND YELLOW
GREY YELLOW OKAY
OH I THINK IT'S UH IT'S NOT VERY DULL
IT'S QUITE MODERN ACTUALLY
DON'T YOU THINK
HMM
OKAY
OKAY BUT UH I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO PRINT A PICTURE ON UH THE DEVICE
BECAUSE UH I AGREE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON THE DEVICE ITSELF
BUT
OH I'VE READ
YES
YES BUT OUR MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT IS NOT SO ADVANCED IN ITS UH TECHNIQUES
THEY'RE ACTUALLY VERY SLOW IN ITS TECHNIQUES
SO
SO I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
OKAY SO SCROLL WHEEL
BUT THERE WILL BE SOME ADDITIONAL BUTTONS I GUESS
AND TH THE THEY SHOULD BE SPONGY ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE RUBBER TOO
WELL UH YOU CAN USE WELL WHEN YOU USE THE BUTTONS THEY'LL THEY'LL BE MADE OF RUBBER TOO
SO IT HAS TH THE SPONGY UH FEEL ALSO
SO I I THINK THAT'S OKAY
YES
THAT'S OKAY
YES THE SIGNS
UH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
WELL MAYBE THAT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE UM UH OUR MANUFACTURING DIVISION ALSO OFFERS PLASTIC FINISHING
SO MAYBE THEY CAN COMBINE THESE TWO
YEAH
MM-HMM
WELL I'M I'M NOT SO SURE I THINK IT C SHOULD BE
WELL I'M NOT SURE I HAVE TO ASK WITH MANUFACTURING BUT I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR THE SPONGY FEEL AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WITH RUBBER
SO IF YOU WANT THE SPONGY FEEL YOU NEED UH TO MAKE THESE BUTTONS ALL ALL OF RUBBER
I THINK BOTH
I DO
I THINK
OKAY
UM NOT QUITE
UM WHAT ABOUT
UH THE CHIPS
WE USE THE REGULAR CHIP
OKAY
AND
WELL NO I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT
YES
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ADVANCED AND THE REGULAR VERSION IS THAT THE ADVANCED UH VERSION OF THE CHIP SUPPORTS L. C. D.
THAT'S ALL
AND WE'VE DECIDED NOT TO USE L. C. D.
SO
OKAY
OKAY
I'LL PUT IT ONLINE
UM
MM DON'T THINK SO
UNLESS UH THINGS HAVE SUDDENLY CHANGE AGAIN
UH DON'T KNOW
MAYBE UH YOU'VE GOT NEW INFORMATION LIKE UH LAST TIME
OKAY
OOP
NO
'KAY
HMM
OH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
MY METHOD
WELL FINDINGS
UH
EASE OF USE IS IMPORTANT BUT UH INNOVATION IS MORE IMPORTANT AND A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL IS UH EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND UH SOME FASHION WATCHERS HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THE YOUNG TARGET GROUP LIKES FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
IN THEIR UH CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE AND THAT THEY WANT SPONGY MATERIAL
PROBABLY WATCH TOO MUCH SPONGE BOB
UH THE OLDER GROUP UH STILL PREFERS DARK COLOURS
SIMPLE SHAPES UH M MATERIAL
BUT WE SINCE WE ARE CONCENTRATING ON UH
THE YOUNGER GROUP
'KAY
WELL UH ONE EXAMPLE GIVEN WAS THIS SO UM I ASSUME THEY JUST WANT SOMETHING COLOURFUL
NOT UH SPECIFICALLY UH AN APPLE AS A REMOTE CONTROL OR SOMETHING
NO UH THE YOUNGER GROUP LIKES UH MORE COLOURFUL
UH
OBJECTS
BUT
WHICH ONE
THIS
YES
UH WELL IT MIGHT
BUT PERSONALLY I WOULDN'T LIKE A SPONGE AS A REMOTE CONTROL
BUT
MAYBE SOFT MATERIAL OR SOMETHING
BUT NOT A REAL SPONGE
YEAH EXACTLY
YEAH AND LIKE UH THE OLDER GROUP LIKES FAMILIAR MATERIALS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD USE WOOD
SO
WELL THIS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE
BUT SINCE WE'RE CONTEN CONCENTRATING ON UH THE YOUNGER GROUP
I THINK WE SHOULD USE SOFT MATERIALS
AND UH MAKE IT COLOURFUL OR UH LIKE CELL PHONES EXCH EXCHANGEABLE COVERS
SO WE COULD PROVIDE
BOTH FOR THE YOUNG AND THE OLD WHAT THEY LIKE
I'VE SEEN IT BUT
'KAY
UH THAT'S ABOUT IT
YES
UH SOFT MATERIAL
UH THE FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
YES
APPARENTLY
YEAH
UM
UH WELL IT'S OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY NEW
SO IT MIGHT ATTRACT UH THE YOUNG CUSTOMERS
HMM
AND YEAH THE YEAH THE OLDER PEOPLE LIKED WOOD
NO THE
YEAH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE LIKED SOFT MATERIAL
YEAH
YEAH
STANDARD
NAH UM N NO I DON'T THINK SO
M
HMM
OR BLACK AND YELLOW
YEAH
UH DIDN'T DID WE INC UH INCLUDE THE DIGI DIGITS OR UH LEAVE THEM TO THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
'CAUSE THINGS LIKE UH VOLUME COULD BE UH PLACED NEXT TO THE BUTTON
THERE THE ICONS
SO YOU DON'T TOUCH THE ICONS THAT MUCH
OKAY
COULD COULD I SEE THE SCROLL BAR AS UH AS AS A SORT OF SHORTCUT
A A AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION AS WELL TH MAYBE YOU COULD UH COULD UH
YEAH
OKAY
OKAY GOOD
AND AND THE CASE IS IS RUBBER
AND THE BUTTONS
OKAY AND UH THE COLOURING
WITH WITH GREY OR BLACK
OKAY WE'LL WE'LL COME TO THAT LATER
UM
OKAY
ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD OR
YEAH
M UH YEAH
M M BUT MAYBE YOU DO WANT A PROGRAMME BUTTON TO UH FOR EXAMPLE ACTIVATE THE VOICE RECOGNITION OR TRAIN THE VOICE VOICE RECOGNITION
YEAH AL ALTHOUGH BY PRESSING THE BUTTON FOR I N DON'T KNOW TWO THREE SECONDS
YOU COULD ALSO SAY IT YOU'D DISABLE IT WITH A LITTLE BEEP AND AND BUT O OKAY THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
THE BASIC OKAY
OKAY
UM YOU THOUGHT OF SOME EVALUATION CRIT CRITERIA
OKAY
YOU ARE NAMELESS
NO
OKAY SO THIS THESE ARE THE CR UH THE CRITERIA
OKAY WELL
THE THEN WE'LL SWITCH TO MY PRESENTATION
UM
THE PRODUCTION COSTS
THE COSTS ARE NOT UNDER
CAN I
UM THIS IS THE
YEAH IT'S IT'S W WAY ABOVE UM UH ABOVE THE THE THE TWELVE EURO FIFTY
AND WHAT MAKES IT VERY EXPENSIVE IS UH FOR EXAMPLE THE SOLAR CELL
SO I GUESS WE SHOULD SKIP THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT
YEAH THE THE PRICE THE THE NUMBER OF ITEMS AND THE THE SUM
UM WELL THIS IS WHAT I WOULD CALL OUR LUXURY MODEL
UM IF YOU WOULD IF YOU LOOK AT THE UH W W W WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE IT MORE UM
TO MAKE IT JUST BETWEEN THE TWELVE EURO FIFTY UM THEN I
DID THE FOLLOWING CHANGES
TWELVE EURO FORTY CENTS I CAME UP WITH BY LEAVING OUT THE SOLAR CELLS
UM BY NOT USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE BECAUSE IT'S UH IT'S A FOUR EURO UH ADDITION TO THE PRICE
UM
YEAH I BELIEVE
UH PUSH BUTTON WELL
IT MAKES IT THE THIRTEEN YEAH
PUSH BUTTONS ARE BUTTONS ARE ARE NOT THE MOST EXPENSIVE BUT DO ADD EXTRA COST
SO UM YEAH TH THIS DESIGN IS NOT UM
WITHIN OUR PRICE MODEL
UM
YEAH
IT'S STILL TOO EXPENSIVE YEAH
UM
I I GUESS IF WE LEAVE THE IF WE LEAVE THIS ONE OUT UM OH
AND UH MAYBE NOT USE THE SPECIAL FORM
IT BECOMES A VERY DULL REMOTE CONTROL I KNOW
BUT IT'S THE BOARD DECISION
UM
AND UM YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT AN UH FOCUS ON ANOTHER UH
YEAH M UH MAYBE NOT NOT ALL THAT FANCY BUT JUST WAY WAY MORE EASY UH UH UM BASIC AND UH M MAXIMISE THE PROFITS AND UM
YEAH
YEAH
I KNOW I KNOW
YEAH
ALTHOUGH I THINK WE YEAH
BUT WE COULD STILL MAKE UH A REMOTE CONTROL THAT AP UH UM APPLIES UM MORE TO YOUNG PEOPLE UH BY GIVING IT ANOTHER COLOUR ALREADY
UM SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE UH UH A DEVICE THAT ATTRACTS A LITTLE BIT MORE TO YOUNG PEOPLE
UM BUT UH I AGREE IT'S IT'S NOT A FANCY HIGH TECH UH DEVICE
DEFINITELY NOT NO
IT'S NOT THAT INNOVATIVE
OR HOWEVER YOU S PRONOUNCE THAT
UM SO OKAY
UM
OH THIS IS THE WRONG ONE
SO UH THAT MEANS REDESIGN
WE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME O UH NOW TO TO REDESIGN THE PRODUCT
UM BUT WE CAN EVALUATE THE PROCESS AND UM UH
UH THE SATISFACTION ON HOW THINGS WENT
UM I'M NOT SURE IF WE NEED TO EVALUATE UH THE DEVICE FIRST
I GUESS
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
WE L WE CAN LEARN
YEAH
YEAH
I AGREE
WELL
I D IT IS IT IS
YEAH I THINK SO
YOU LIKE THE RUBBER UH ROO
YEAH
NO I'LL I'LL I'LL GIVE IT A TWO
YOU LIKE TITA
THAT'S A FLAVOUR AS WELL
RIGHT
UM
YEAH I KNOW BUT BUT IT BUT THAT'S FANCY IN THE WAY UM
I MEAN FANCY HAS HAS A LOT OF
YEAH
YEAH
IT APPLIES
IT YEAH
YEAH
YEAH I I AGREE
WELL WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE AND UH
NO WE ARE EVALUATING THIS THIS UH DESIGN NOW
THIS PROTOTYPE
YEAH
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A THRILL
YEP
I'M NOT SURE
I'M NOT SURE
YEAH
YEAH
UH I'M DOUBTING DOUBTING AS WELL
UM
YEAH
OKAY
UH TWO OR THREE
THREE
WHA WH WHAT WOULD BE YOUR GUESS
I MEAN EASE OF USE UM DOES NOT ONLY APPLY TO THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS
IT'S THE UH IT'S IT'S OVERALL
IS THE DEVICE EASY TO USE
YEAH
YEAH
UM
OKAY
UH ROO A THREE
RUUD
OKAY
SO I COULD MAKE IT E EASY
ROO
NO I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET
OKAY BUT IF I WOULD SAY A THREE THEN IT'S SIX AND FOUR IS TEN
DIVIDED BY FOUR IS TWO POINT FIVE
BUT I'M FILLING IN A THREE
DOES IT WILL SO IT WILL BE A TWO POINT FIVE
YES IT IS
I HAVE A VETO
EXACTLY
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CONTENT IT'S ABOUT OKAY UM IS IT EASY TO F
YEAH DEFINITELY
YEAH OR BEEPS OR YEAH
I'M HERE I'M HERE
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
WELL I UH WE SHOULD NOT UH STAY TOO LONG ON THIS SUBJECT UH BECAUSE OF THE TIME BUT I PERSONALLY GIVE IT A ONE
UM SEBASTIAN
RIGHT WELL
THE FEEL OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SPONGY
WELL UH IT CAN'T BE MORE SPONGY
SO
NO OKAY BUT BUT
FOR THE OPTIONS GIVEN IT'S THE MOST SPONGY ONE
YEAH
YEAH
THEY'RE OUT THERE
YEAH
I'LL GIVE IT A ONE
YEAH I KNOW BUT YOU HAVE TO NAME A FIG UH A NUMBER
BECAUSE WE NEED TO GO ON IN FOR THE TIME
YOU ARE OKAY
THE REMOTE CONTROL OFFERS ENOUGH FEATURES
WELL RUUD WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT
YEAH
YEAH I KNOW
WHAT WHAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IS UM UH
I THINK IT HAS
YEAH
BEC BECAUSE YOU CAN UM WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT BUT YOU DO HAVE UH REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE ABLE TO ADAPT ANOTHER SIGNAL
SO YOU PLACE A A REGULAR UH REMOTE CONTROL IN FRONT OF THE OTHER ONE HIT THE ONE OR THE TWO OR THE THREE
WHATEVER AND IT R RECORDS THE UH THE UM THE THE SIGNALS
SO YOU COULD UH UH UH
ENTER ANY COMMENT YOU LIKE AS LONG IT'S ABLE TO AS LONG AS OUR DEVICE IS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE INFRARED SIGNAL
SO I THINK TH THIS UH THIS IS UH A A REMOTE CONTROL WITH A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF FEATURES
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE I A FEW BUTTONS BUT THE INSIDE IS IS QUITE UH ADVANCED
YEAH
YEAH
YEP
YEAH
OKAY UM LET'S GIVE IT A NUMBER
I'LL GIVE IT UH A ONE
FOR FOR THE FOR THIS T UH TYPE OF MARKET I THINK IT'S A ONE
YEAH
SO HIGH QUALITY LOW ACCEPTANCE
THE PRODUCT IS IS IS UH B HIGH QUA UH HAS A HIGH QUALITY AND AND IS UH ADVANCED
BUT
WHETHER OR NOT OUR CLIENTS ARE ARE UM WILLING TO PAY TWENTY FIVE EUROS FOR THIS KIND OF DEVICE IS DOUB IS WELL IS NOT SURE
D DO YOU AGREE
YEAH
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A RADAR UH FUNCTION
TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEAH
MM-HMM
BU BUT WELL YEAH I KNOW BUT YOU'RE PAYING FOR TH FOR THE BRAND
BECAUSE THERE ARE UH REMOTE CONTROLS WHICH CONTROL YOUR STEREO TELEVISION D. V. D. C. D. PLAYER FOR UNDER TWENTY FIVE EUROS
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
UM YOU HAD AN OVERALL RATING
UM
THAT'S COUNTING
OKAY
OKAY
UM WE'LL GO FURTHER ON WITH THE THE REST OF THE EVALUATION
ABOUT THE PROJECT ITSELF NOT ABOUT THE PRODUCT
UM
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT UH
THE PROCESS THE PROJECT PROCESS
RUUD
TRY TO TRANSLATE THAT
ANY ANY OTHER UH ROO
ROO
YEAH
BETTER DECISION
YEAH
LESS
YEAH
SO WE COULD WE WE COULD BE WE COULD'VE BEEN CREATIVE
BUT UM IT WAS TEMPERED BY THE CHOICE OF COMPONENTS AND THE THE PRICE
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY ROO
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS ON THAT
RUUD
YOU AGREE OKAY
UH LEADERSHIP
OKAY ROO'S ON FOR HIS PROMOTION
OKAY
I THINK SO TOO IT'S IT'S IT'S UH OF COURSE A LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT
I MISSED IT UM TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT YOU IN BETWEEN AND UH SAY UH HEY ROO UH
UM
YEAH
SO UM
YEAH BUT BUT SI UH W W W WHEN TAKEN IN ACCOUNT THE THE SITUATION UH I THINK WE PERFORMED PRETTY WELL
YEAH
UM THE MEANS THE SMARTBOARD THE DIGITAL PEN
DID YOU LIKE 'EM
BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE OR
OKAY
UH
OKAY SO IT IT HAD TO BE UM
BETTER ALIGNED OR WHAT'S THE WORD
UH YEAH
IT IT WAS CALIBRATED JUST BEFORE THIS MEETING
UH THE ONE BEFORE THE THIRD MEETING
SO UH IT'S NOT THE CALIBRATION IT'S THE THING ITSELF I THINK
UH RUUD W UH DID YOU USE THE PEN A LOT
OR NOT AT ALL
NOT AT ALL
OKAY
I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE A HANDY UH THING ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE UM O. C. R.
YEAH
TO DIGITISE THEM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
I KNOW
YEAH
OKAY
UM
WHAT W UH RUUD WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE SMARTBOARDS
YEAH
OKAY YOU CAN'T REALLY DECIDE
NO
I MISSED A FEATURE TO EASILY SELECT UH A SLIDE AND UH DISTRIBUTE IT TO THE LAPTOPS
I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY EASY IF YOU COULD SAY OKAY I WANT TO USE THIS FOR MY OWN WORK OR MY OWN PRESENTATION FURTHER ON OR
OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND THAT YOU COULD SHOW BUT M
I KNOW
I KNOW BUT
I KNOW BUT WE COULDN'T USE THAT FEATURE SO I MISSED IT
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT
AT LEAST THE UM I WASN'T EXPLAINED HOW TO DO SUCH A TH
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY SO Y IT IT'S NOT EVEN AS ADVANCED AS PAINT
YEAH
OKAY
UH NO
YEAH THE PROJECT IS EVALUATED
UM BUT WELL WE NEED TO REDESIGN UH THE PRODUCT
CELEBRATE
OKAY
UM YOU'RE DISMISSED
NO I THINK WE ARE UH READY
PRIVATE ROOM ROO
THAT SOUNDS QUITE SCARY
NO LET'S FIND UH THE WAY TO
I DON'T BELIEVE SO
WELL MAYBE WE'D
GET AN EMAIL
THANK YOU FOR YOUR
FORTY MINUTES
A MINUTE OR OR TEN MAYBE
M YEAH TEN OR FIVE
SO WE CAN UH
REDESIGN OUR UH
UH I WOULD LIKE TO
OH
YEAH
YEAH
IT'S BLUE TONGUE
YEAH
THIS IS A NEW MODEL
BUT
BLUE TONGUE
IT'S SPONGY
THAT IS UH IT'S A NEW FEATURE NEXT TO BLUETOOTH TO UM DISABLE ALL BLUETOOTH DEVICES
UM
YEAH WE'RE DONE HERE
GENTLEMEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION
YES
THAT'S THE SAME AS UH ON THE TOP OF IT UH WITH THE THE ROUND UH BUTTON
BUT UH WE DON'T UH WE DON'T UH WE DO THINK IT'S UM WELL WHAT IF WITH EASE OF USE
W WHICH PREFERS THE WHICH THE THE CUSTOMER OF THE USER PREFERS
PLASTIC OR RUBBER
WELL YEAH
AND A BUTTON FOR DISABLING THE VOICE RECOGNITION
YEAH
THAT'S THE BASIC IDEA YEAH
OF OUR PROTOTYPE
SO JUST WALK THROUGH IT STEP BY STEP
I MEAN IS IT FANCY EVERYTHING I BELIEVE UH
I BELIEVE IT'S FANCY
OH SORRY
TWENTY TWO
YIKES
WHY DOES THE PRICE AND AND THE S OH ONE UH EXA YEAH
THE NUMBER OF UH YEAH
AND AND DOES IT
BUT THAT'S THAT'S ONLY FOR THE BUTTONS
SO THE BUTTON WE CAN USE PLASTIC
AND THE PLA UH
AND A PLASTIC B JUST PLASTIC BUTTONS A PLAS UH INSTEAD OF RUBBER
YEAH TOO BAD
MM-HMM
UM THE YELLOW RUBBER I THINK SO
I'M INTO IT
IT'S TRENDY TRENDY FUN YEAH
WELL JUST GIVE IT A TWO
IT'S NOT THE ULTIMATE UH FANCY TWO BUT
YEAH BUT THAT'S STI THAT'S UH
LOOKING AT THE USER UH NEEDS WE ONLY UH DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THE DOUBLE CURVED CASE
WE W WE DO HAVE UH THE RUBBER WE DO HAVE THE COLOURS
THAT'S TWO OUT OF THREE
SO I BELIEVE UH WE ARE CLOSE UH TO TWO
BUT THAT'S NOT IN IT
OV OR CAN WE
OKAY
AND THE SCROLL UH WHEEL
THE SOLAR NOT MANY REMOTES
HAVE THE SOLAR I THINK
YEAH
WELL YEAH THE VOICE RECOGNITION OF COURSE IS HARD TO LEARN I THINK
WELL HARD IT'S NOT FOR THE FOR THE E FOR THE ELDERLY
THEY WON'T USE IT
I THINK
I THINK A THREE
WOULDN'T GIVE IT MORE
YEP
IF YOU MAKE IT A FOUR IT WILL BE THREE IN GENERAL
IF HE MAKES IT A FOUR
NOT A THREE
DARN
NEE
A SEVEN A THREE NO
A FOUR AND A THREE TOGETHER
YEAH YOU HAVE A TWO HE HAS A TWO
THREE
AND A THREE
NEE
I KNOW
YES
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE CONCLUSION AS A THREE THREE
THEN YOU WOULD MAKE A FOUR
IF YOU FILL OUT A FOUR
YEAH WE HAVEN'T RE UH RE UH REALLY WORKED IT OUT BUT YOU C YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST SAY FIND AND HE REPEATS FIND
YEAH BUT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE THE BASIC IDEA OF THE THE SPEAKER UH
BUT EVEN WITHOUT IT
YEAH
ME TOO
WAS IT ONE OF OUR OPTIONS
SO IN THE IN
YEAH
BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE IN THIS CASE WE'VE DONE THE BEST WE COULD
I WAN I'LL TAKE ONE
IT WILL BE A ONE
YEAH BUT IT HA DOESN'T HAS THE DIGITS
I BELIEVE IT'S
IF YOU UH ASK YOURSELF IT OFFERS ENOUGH FEATURES I DON'T I DON'T THINK
IT IS IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES UM A NORMAL REMOTE HAS
YEAH
I'LL GIVE A TWO
BUT WE COULD COULDN'T UH WHAT WHAT'S THE SELLING PRICE
FIFTY
UH TWENTY FIVE
AND COSTS WERE TWELVE FIFTY
BUT EVEN NOW IF ONLY OUR PRODUCTION COSTS W UH WERE EXCEEDED THE DOUBLE
THINK
PRODUCTION COST WAS WERE T UH WAS TWENTY TWO
SO UH SELLING PRICE UH WOULD BE UH YEAH
THAT'S PRICE BUT W W
NO
AN ORIGINAL REMOTE CONTROL OF ANY T. V. KIND UH A PHILLIPS REMOTE CONTROL Y YOU PAY UH
YEAH I KN I KNOW UH FROM A FEW YEARS AGO IT IT IT COSTED HUNDRED GILDERS
FOUR SIX SEVEN EIGHT
NINE DIVIDED BY SIX
HMM
YEAH I THINK UH
THE PROCESS WAS GOOD
BUT W UM WE WEREN'T AWARE OF THE PRICES OF THE COSTS
AND AND THAT WAS THE THE BIG DEAL
I IF WE KNEW THAT BEFORE WE C WE COULD HAVE MADE THE THE CHOICE BETWEEN WHAT YEAH
NO NO
FANTASTIC
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
RESPONSE AND
UH IT IT HAS YEAH
YEAH IT'S NOT ACCURATE
THE P THE POINTING OF THE PEN IS NOT UM THE PLACE WHERE IT IT WRITES ITS UM UH WHERE IT UH
YEAH WHERE IT DRAWS
IT'S UH THE DRAWING ON ON THE B ON THE BOARD IS R RIGHT FROM THE PEN
SO UH
YOU TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT THAT YOUR YOU M YEAH UH
IT'S TOO SLOW
HMM
YEP
IF IT HAS O. C. R. UH I THINK UH I WOULD USE BUT UH I I JUST UH TOOK NOTES FOR MYSELF AND AND AND THAT'S IT
IT W IT W YEAH
IT WAS NECESSARY FOR ME TO UH
YEAH BECAUSE IF I WANT SOMETHING ON THE COMPUTER I JUST TYPE IT
I TYPE FASTER THAN I WRITE
SO
ECONOMIC
YEAH
BUT Y YOU CAN IF YOU SAVE THIS IMAGE YOU CAN OPEN IT IN YOUR SHARED WORK FOLDER
SO IT'S ALMOST YEAH
YEP
MM-HMM
A AND THE FUNCTION OF OF FILLING AN AN UH AN OVAL OR AN AN OBJECT
I IT'S NOT POSSIBLE YEAH
OH IT LOOKS LIKE PAINT ACTUALLY
GREAT
IT WAS A PRIVILEGE WORKING WITH YOU
TO PRIVATE ROOMS
BUT YOU SEE THE PROBLEM Y YOU CAN'T CONTINUE YOUR UH YOUR LINE
WELL IT'S FLUFFY ALRIGHT
SPONGY
A GIRAFFE
RIGHT
THAT'S ALRIGHT
LIKE THIS ONE
IT'S IMPORTANT
UH I THINK TH THIS IS DEVICE WHICH WHICH HAS A LEARNING CURVE
UM NOVICE USERS U USE THIS DEVICE AS UH NORMAL USERS USE UH A C A REMOTE CONTROL
AND AFTER A WHILE THEY START TO DEVELOP UH SOME SKILLS IN THE THE VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTIONS AND THEN THEY WILL NOT USE THIS DIAL AS OFTEN
BUT OTHER USERS WHO ARE NEW TO THIS DEVICE NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THEY N THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT UH HOW TO CHANGE CHANNELS AND UH CHANGE THE VOLUME SO IT'S EASIER FOR THEM
YEAH MAYBE SO
YES IT'S
WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S ANOTHER APPROACH IT'S MORE THAT OUR UM
THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF DOING UH THINGS UH ON SUCH A DEVICE
IT'S IT'S QUITE EASY
YES RUBBER
THERE ARE PLASTIC OR RUBBER
UH YELLOW WITH UH
GREY OR BLACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHATEVER COST UH COST UH THE LEAST
NO
UH MAYBE WE SHOULD UH THINK ABOUT THESE BUTTONS
BUT
YES BUT IT BUT THESE ARE TASKS THAT ARE ONLY EXECUTED ONCE I THINK
OR NOT
WELL OKAY
OKAY YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
OR SOMETHING LI LIKE THAT
YES
IS IT SPONGY
I BELIEVE IT'S FANCY TOO
OKAY
WELL IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE
OKAY
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
OKAY
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT COMPLETE
BECAUSE WE USE SPEC UH SPECIC UH SPECIAL MATERIALS THE LAST ITEM
AND YOU HAVE NOT ADDED ONE ITEM THERE
SO IT'S C WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
BUT IT
YES
WELL B BASICALLY IT WHEN WHEN THIS IS OUR ONLY OPTION WE SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER CHANGING THE CASING
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S VERY LITTLE ADDED VALUE IN UH AN ENHANCED CASE WITH THESE DULL FUNCTIONS
SO
TYPE OF M MAYBE ANOTHER MARKET SEGMENT
YEAH
YES
THAT'S MAYBE THAT'S BETTER
MAYBE WE COULD UH WE SHOULD GO FOR STRAIGHT AND SIMPLE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT UH HAS BEEN ASKED
SO WE SHOULD KICK THE BOARD'S UH WELL
HMM
YES
WELL MAYBE IT'S GOOD TO DO IT ANYWAY BECAUSE IF WE EVALUATE IT WE WE CAN ALSO DETERMINE IF OUR OBJECTIVES ARE GOOD
SO
IS IT FANCY
I THINK SO
BUT IT'S NOT THAT FANCY
I MEAN
I THINK UH I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FANCY IF WE USED THE TITANIUM HOUSING THE CASING
IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE OH YOU REALLY LIKE TITANIUM
I'M I'M INTO IT
IT HAS FLAVOUR
YES THAT'S RIGHT
YOU SHOULD TASTE IT
IT HAS TO DO WITH FASHION I GUESS
SO DO
OKAY
YES
I THINK I TH I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN I WOULD HAVE THINK UH IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE FANCY BY USING THE DOUBLE CURVED CASE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE FANCY BUT WE DECIDED NOT TO BECAUSE IF WE USE A DOUBLE CURVED CASE WE COULD NOT USE SOLAR
SO
YES
YES I AGREE TOO
IT'S OKAY
WE DID YES WE DID GOOD
WELL LET'S LET'S THIS PRODUCT
SO I I I THINK IT IS
I THINK IT'S INNOVATIVE
NO
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE INNOVATIVE U BY USING THE KINETIC UH ENERGY SOURCE BUT IT'S IT'S WAY TOO YES BUT
I THINK UH IT'S A TWO
WELL BUT THERE ARE TWO PARTS IN THIS REMOTE CONTROL
WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS IS THE BASIC PART
EVERYBODY CAN USE IT SO THAT'S EASY TO USE
THAT'S FOR A NOVICE USER
WHEN YOU HAVE A MORE ADVANCED ELABORATE USER WELL SUCH A USER REALLY WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE ALL THESE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS
SO IN THAT IN THAT WAY IT IS ADVANCED
AND I THINK IT'S EASY TO USE FOR FOR BOTH UH TYPES OF USERS
SO UH
IT'S MAYBE IT'S NOT VERY UH EASY FOR
OKAY
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT BUT I I GUESS UH AN ADVANCED USER WILL WILL FIND THE VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTION EASY TO USE
BECAUSE HE IS ALREADY HE OR SHE IS ALREADY AN ADVANCED USER
SO
AFTER ALL I THINK PERSONALLY I WOULD GIVE A TWO
BUT
SO IT'S TWO TWO AND THREE
TWO THREES
SO THAT'S TEN
SO THAT'S W
NO TWO AND A HALF
SIX AND FOUR
SIX AND FOUR IS TEN
DIVIDED BY FOUR IS TWO AND A HALF
SO
YES
FOUR
TWO
DIVIDED BY FOUR
THAT'S NOT EVEN
BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO FILL IN SO WE HAVE TO ROUND IT
YES
IT IT MOST DEFINITELY IS IT'S VERY EASY
YES
MAYBE UH I I THINK I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MAYBE YOU HAVE TO UH PROGRAMME IT ONCE SO TO THAT L RESPOND TO UH A CERTAIN WORD OR A CERTAIN SENTENCE
SOMETHING LIKE WHERE ARE YOU AND THEN IT WILL SING I'M HERE
SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO I TH
YEAH ME TOO
WELL IT CAN BE
THERE ARE CASES UM IN WHICH THE OUTSIDE CASING IS UM CAN BE UH HOW D HOW DO YOU PRONO IS IS MOLDABLE
NO IT'S NOT ONE OF OUR OPTION BUT WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MARKET WHEN YOU LOOK
UH YES BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT UH WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT I THINK
BECAUSE WE COMPARE ALL THESE UH CHARACTERISTICS CHARACTERISTICS WITH UH MARKET UH WITH WITH THE REAL MARKET
SO THERE ARE UH REMOTE CONTROLS OUT THERE WHICH ARE A LOT MORE SPONGY
THEY'RE OUT THERE
YES BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH SO IT'S A TWO
YOU TAKE ONE
WHAT DO YOU GIVE IT
NO NO NO
UH I'LL I'LL CHANGE IT I'LL MAKE IT M MY MY MARK WILL BE A FOUR
BASICALLY IT'S IT'S COMPLETELY PROGRAMMABLE
YOU CAN ADD VERY M MUCH FUNCTIONALITY BY UH USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION MODE
SO IT'S QUITE ADVANCED
YES
HAS UH THE SIGNALS SENT TO IT
ABSOLUTELY
YES
BUT THAT THAT'S ITS POWER I GUESS BECAUSE UH A REGULAR PROGRAMMABLE UH REMOTE CONTROL CONTAINS WELL UH REALLY A LOT OF BUTTONS
AT AT LEAST UH FORTY BUTTONS
SO IT'S IT'S QUITE S COMPLICATED TO GET UH TO GET USED TO
AND THIS IS QUITE S SIMPLE
YOU CAN USE YOUR VOICE TO TO PROGRAMME IT
IT'S
YEAH I'LL GIVE IT A ONE
YES
I I'VE I THINK WE'VE UH SUCCE SUCCEED IN IN DEVELOPING A PRODUCT THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD
BUT NOT FOR THIS KIND OF MARKET AND NOT FOR THIS KIND OF PRICE
SO
HMM
YES
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YES I AGREE
I
YEAH OKAY
BUT
YES
M ABOUT FIFTY EUROS
THAT'S QUITE EX WELL IT'S NOT IT'S NOT VERY EXPENSIVE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL THAT THAT HAS THIS FUNCTIONALITY
YES IT'S MORE THAN FIFTY EUROS
IT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE YES
YES
YES BUT YOU CAN YOU C
YES BUT YOU CAN LEARN THIS THING ALL THESE FUNCTIONS
AND IT'S EASIER TO USE BECAUSE THOSE UH REMOTE CONTROLS DON'T OFFER VOICE RECOGNITION AND THIS ONE DOES
SO I THINK IT'S WORTH ITS PRICE
WELL IT'S IT'S ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WELL
WELL I THINK
MM
ACTUALLY WE HAD
YES
WE HAD WE HAD TOO LITTLE INFORMATION ACTUALLY
SO AND UH UM THE THE THE WELL LOOKING AT ROOM FOR CREATIVITY THERE WAS
W WAY TOO THE THE CHOICE OF COMPONENTS WAS WAY TOO NARROW
SO THERE WAS NOT REALLY A PROCESS OF UH
WELL
YES
WELL IN THE FIRST MEETING WE WE ALREADY WERE VERY CREATIVE
WE WE THOUGHT OF POSSIBILITIES WHO ARE NOT POSSIBLE UH WITH THE THE CURRENT UH OFFER OF UH MANUFACTURING COMPONENTS
SO
WE'RE TEMPERED BY THAT YES
YEAH OKAY
I THINK WE'RE A GOOD TEAM
YES
WELL I TRIED ONCE BUT THAT WAS NOT ALLOWED
I THINK SO TOO
UH
THE DIGITAL PEN WAS OKAY BUT SMARTBOARD WAS REALLY BAD
IT IT'S
THE RESPONSE IS VERY SLOW AND THE POSSIBILITIES ARE VERY LIMITED
IT'S NOT ACCURATE
MAYBE IT'S IT NEEDS TO BE CALIBRATEDS
IT IS
OKAY
OKAY
I I THINK SO TOO
YES
YES
MM-HMM
BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT SOLUTION FOR UH FOR UH A KNOWN PROBLEM UH WRITING DOWN SOME NOTES
SOME SOME INF UH INFORMATION AND THEN UM FORGETTING YOUR NOTEBOOK SOMEWHERE AND LOSING ALL THAT INFORMATION
BECAUSE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING IN ONE PLACE AND IT'S QUITE EASY QUITE EASY IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION DIGITAL AND SHARE IT WITH OTHERS IN A QUITE EASY WAY
I THINK IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT
I ONLY THINK IT'S TH THE THE SHAPE OF THE PEN IS TOO BIG
IT'S NOT QUITE UH ERGONOMIC
ECO ERGONOMIC
YES
YES YES
THAT'S QUITE WHAT POWERPOINT DOES
AN OBJECT YES
YES
THE DRAWING CAP CAPABILITIES ARE VERY LIMITED
AND AND UH W YOU WERE WHEN YOU'RE USING UH WINDOWS YOU'RE USED TO A CERTAIN INTERFACE AND CERTAIN BUTTONS UH WHICH YOU CAN USE FOR DRAWING
AND A LOT OF THESE BUTTONS DON'T APPEAR HERE
SO IT'S
NOT NOT UH N NOT WAY
IT'S QUITE UH LIMITED
OKAY
OH VERY GOOD CELEBRATION
POP UH POP UP THE CHAMPAGNE
OKAY
I SEE SOME ACTION OVER THERE
OKAY
UH WE'RE DONE WE'RE FINISHED I BELIEVE
SO
ARE THERE ANY MORE CYCLES IN THIS PROCESS
I THINK NOT
BUT UM HOW MUCH TIME DID WE GET FOR THIS MEETING
AND HOW MUCH TIME IS LEFT
TEN MINUTES
OKAY
OKAY
WELL I THINK WE WE WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE REDESIGN SHOULD BE
A SIMPLE DULL UH ONE COLOURED BOX
NO IT'S IT'S JUST THE SAME PRODUCT THAT IS ALREADY ON THE MARKET
WHAT IS THAT
IT'S A GIRAFFE EATING A EATING LEAVES FROM A TREE
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY PROMOTING BLUETOOTH
OR BLUE TONGUE
BLUE TONGUE
OKAY
LET'S WRAP IT UP
THANK YOU MISTER MANAGER
NOW LET'S HAVE UH A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
WELL YOU COULD USE TWO OF THEM TO PROGRAMME THE UM CHANNELS ON THE TWO CHANNEL BUTTON 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO ASSIGN TWO CHANNEL NEW CHANNELS
YOU
YES
UH MY NAME IS NOT NAME BUT
UH WELL I USED THE THE UH DOCUMENTS
AND THESE UH
WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA
IT SHOULD BE
YEAH THAT'S UH HOW THE FASHION GUYS UH STATE IT
FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
SO
UH WELL APPAR
YEAH BUT APPARENTLY UH WE SHOULDN'T EVALUATE YET
SO
YEAH I THINK THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA
SO UH THAT'S ABOUT IT
UM WELL SINCE WE'RE NOT GONNA MANUFACTURE IT ANYWAY
UH
YAY
IS IT
IS IT FANCY
SO UH ONE
IS IT UH
AND W YEAH W WHAT THEY WANT WANTED WAS UH COLOURS AND SOFT MATERIALS
SO IN THAT WAY
IT IT'S FANCY
OKAY AND UH WAS IT
INNOVATIVE
YEP
YEAH AND UH
SO UH ALSO A UH TWO
IS IT EASY TO USE
WELL THE P THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IS EASY TO USE
THE THE ZAPPING CHANNEL SWITCHING VOLUME
BUT THE MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS ARE PROBABLY
A BIT HARDER
GOOD QUESTION
UH I'LL GO UH FOR THE TWO
HMM
HUH
YEAH
I YEAH
YEAH TWO TWO THREE
NO
IS IT EASY TO FIND
YEAH I AGREE
NO
UH THIS THIS WAS A MOST SPONGY OPTION
WELL YEAH IT DEPENDS 'CAUSE IT'S THE MOST SPONGY WE COULD BUT YEAH
WELL IF I GIVE IT A ONE
THERE'LL BE ONE HELL OF A CALCULATION
SO I'LL JUST GIVE IT A TWO AND MAKE THIS A ONE POINT FIVE
WELL THE BASIC LAYOUT DOESN'T OFFEM OFFER MUCH BUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD ADD A LOT
SO
YEAH DEPENDS
UH DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU UH IMPLEMENT IN THE SPEECH FEAT
SIGNAL
UM I THINK THINK A ONE 'CAUSE V WITH A VOICE RECOGNITION YOU COULD ADD ANYTHING YOU WANT SO THAT'S LIKE UM
MAYBE EVEN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK ADVANCED
YEAH BUT UH WITH THESE RATINGS UH
SHOULD BE ABOUT ONE POINT S SEVEN YEAH
YE
THE PRICES
I AGREE
DRAWS
NO
NOT REALLY
OH I ONLY USE IT TO DRAW A RABBIT SO CAN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT IT
NO OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND
YEAH
AND NO ADDED VALUE
AT ALL
SO
IN INTERESTING DESIGN
OH UH IT IT DOES UH HAVE A NATURAL UH FEELING
SO
YEAH

GOOD DAY
NICK BROER USER INTERFACE DESIGNER
I'M GOING TO UH LOOK AT THE TECHNICAL DESIGN FROM THE UH USER POINT OF VIEW
THE CREATIVE GENIUS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WELL I'M MORE INTO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF DRAWING SO I'M NOT REALLY GOOD AT DRAWING ANIMALS BUT UH THE ANIMAL WHICH I OH
PEN
UH FORMAT
ELSE MY ANIMAL WILL BE LIKE KING SIZE
I PRETTY MUCH LIKE A DOLPHIN BECAUSE OF ITS UH ITS FREEDOM BASICALLY
LET'S SEE
A HEAD
ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THIS
IT'S LIKE UH IT'S A VERY
UH HIGH TECH
BIT LOW RESPONSIVE THOUGH
PREFER PEN AND PAPER
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A NUCLEAR BOMB
THIS THING ISN'T DOING WHAT I'M
WHAT I WANT
SO
YEAH WELL IT DOES LOOK LIKE A NUCLEAR BOMB
I'LL JUST FINISH UP REAL SOON BECAUSE I'M
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE A DOLPHIN BUT THEN AGAIN THIS IS ALL NEW FOR ME
LIKE THE OCEAN LIKE SWIMMING
DO THAT IN MY SPARE TIME SO THAT'S BASICALLY AN
NOW WE CAN FORGET THIS EVER HAPPENED
IT'S NOT REALLY THAT RESPONSIVE NO
AND YOU WAS MAKING COMMENTS ON MY DOLPHIN
YOU PICKED A HARD ONE DIDN'T YOU
GOT IT
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE HAVEN'T YOU
WELL I BASICALLY HAD A QUESTION
DO UH ARE WE GOING TO INTRODUCE A MULTI REMOTE CONTROL
IS IT JUST THE T. V. OR DO WE WANT TO IN
JUST FOR T. V. REMOTE CONTROL
OKAY
WELL I WAS THINKING ABOUT DESIGN REMOTE CONTROL WITH OUR UH MOTTO AND ALL
UH THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT WE NEED TO STICK TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH
NO RATIONAL CHANGES OR WHATEVER 'CAUSE IT REVOLUTIONARY CHANGES YES
UH WE MIGHT HAVE TO CONSIDER OTHER DESIGN ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCT
SO THAT WAS SOMETHING I WANTED TO ADD AND PERHAPS SOME USABILITY ASPECT
T. V. IS BECOMING CENTRAL IN MOST HOMES
DO WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED IN ANY WAY TO UH YEAH TO BE ABLE TO USE IT AS WELL
YEAH
OKAY WELL THAT'S NOT THAT MUCH TO WORK WITH
MM GOOD LUCK
MORNING
MY NAME IS XAVIER JUERGENS I'M THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND THERE ARE THREE MAIN QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE TO FIND AN ANSWER TO TODAY
FIRST ONE IS UH WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THE APPARATUS SECOND IS WHAT IS UH THE APPARATUS MADE OF AND THE THIRD IS WHAT SHOULD IT LOOK LIKE
UH-HUH
MM
OKAY
OKAY YOU SHOULD PRESS NEXT
OKAY
OKAY WELL THE ANIMAL I'D LIKE TO DRAW IS A TIGER
MY DRAWING SKILLS ARE REALLY BAD SO
THEY ARE REALLY BAD MY DRAWING SKILLS
I'M NOT SURE HOW THE LEGS SHOULD GO BUT
UH THESE ARE STRIPES
I'VE PICKED THIS ANIMAL BECAUSE IT'S VERY FAST
IT IS UH IT KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTS
UH IT HARDLY EVER WASTES ANY RESOURCES
UH WELL BASICALLY UH IT HUNTS FOR PREY BUT IT DOES IT ALWAYS IN A VERY WELL THOUGHT WAY
UH IT KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTS
IT NEVER KILLS AN ANIMAL UH JUST FOR THE KILLING SO IT'S VERY EFFICIENT
AND IT TRIES TO DO EVERYTHING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
AND IT ALWAYS GOES FOR UH SECURITY IN SEEKING UH UH A HIDE SPOT AND UH AND DOING EVERYTHING SECURITY SPEED AND EFFICIENCY IS IMPORTANT
AND I THINK UH THOSE THINGS WE CAN USE
YEAH
OH
HMM
ONLY ONE THING UH THAT HAS TO BE ADDED ACCORDING TO ME IS UH THE THE MATERIAL IT IS MADE OF IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIGHT
THAT'S IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF BUT SOME UH YEAH
OKAY
OKAY
OKAY
GOOD LUCK EVERYONE

OKAY
OKAY
YES
WAIT FOR THE MARKETING DIRECTOR ACTUALLY SO
ANYWAYS
UH
SEE SHALL WE WAIT
I'M NOT SURE IF HE'S LATE OR DELAYED OR WHATEVER SO I'M GONNA START SOON WE HAVE NOW DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME ANYWAY
THERE YOU ARE OKAY
UH NO PROBLEM
WE'RE ABOUT TO START SO HAVE A SEAT
OKAY WELCOME AGAIN
TODAY FUNCTIONAL DESIGN PHASE
I'LL TAKE YOU OVER THE MINUTES OF LAST LAST MEETING
OKAY THAT WAS JUST TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER HAVE A LITTLE THOUGHTS ON WHAT YOUR VISION IS AND ON THIS PROJECT SO
I PUT THE MINUTES ON THE I MADE ON THE ON THE P THE THE PROJECT SHARE SO IF YOU WANNA REVIEW THEM THEY'RE THERE
I WILL DO SO AFTER EVERY MEETING SO IF YOU HAVE SOME INFORMATION YOU WANNA TAKE BACK YOU CAN FIND IT THERE
ANYWAYS UM TODAY THREE PRESENTATIONS FROM EVERY ONE OF YOU
UM AFTER THAT I GOT SOME NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS FROM PROJECT BOARD SO WE'RE GONNA GO AF GO AFTER OVER THIS LATER
BUT I WANNA START WITH UH STUFF YOU DID FIRST SO WE CAN SEE WHAT EVERYBODY CAME UP WITH
AND AFTER THAT WE CAN HAVE THE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND SHARE SOME THOUGHTS SO
WHO WOULD LIKE WANNA GO FIRST
TAKE IT
ANYWAY LET'S SEE WHAT YOU HAVE
UH IT'S STILL A BIT OPEN
YOU SHOULD CLOSE IT ON YOUR OWN NOTEBOOK I GUESS
YEAH
SO THERE
OKAY
IF I CAN CUT IN IS IT PEOPLE OR MEN
IS IT PEOPLE OKAY
'CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY MEN SO 'KAY
SO WE HAVE TO S WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
OKAY
OKAY JUST TALK AHEAD
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY THAT'S OKAY
THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD
OKAY WE CAN WE CAN HIDE THOSE UNDER A MENU OR SOMETHING OKAY
THAT'S LIKE A BUTTON ON YOUR T. V.
REMOTE OKAY
OKAY
WE WANNA HAVE A LITTLE PREVIEW ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
PREVIEW WHAT'S ON THE CHANNEL
OKAY
THAT SOUNDS TOO IT'S POSSIBLE BUT UH I THINK IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT DO CONTINUE
OKAY YOU DON'T SET IT YOURSELF IT JUST REMEMBERS THE CHANNEL THAT YOU ARE ON MOST FOR EXAMPLE
YOU WANT THE YOU WANT IT TO BE PROGRAMMED FOR EXAMPLE Y PROGRAMMED F OR YOU WANT IT TO RECOGNISE YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL
LET'S SEE YOU YOU SPEND TWENTY MINUTES EACH DAY ON THAT CHANNEL SO IT RECOGNISES YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL
OKAY SO IT'S IT IT DOES IT RECOGNISE ITSELF YOU DON'T HAVE TO SET IT OKAY
OKAY
I SEE
OKAY
NO PROBLEM IT'S IT'S OKAY THAT'S YEAH GO AHEAD
THAT SEEMS VERY GOOD
MM-HMM
OKAY SO HAVE IT MORE MAKE IT MORE DURABLE ACTUALLY
OKAY
OKAY SO THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE
MM-HMM
YEAH
WOW
THE S YEAH
MAKE IT MAKE THEM BIGGER
EVEN MORE DURABLE UH
OKAY
YEAH IT'S TRUE
YEAH THAT'S CLEAR
NO OF COURSE UH
YEAH
I MUST SAY THAT IT
HMM
THAT WAS IT
OKAY THAT WAS GOOD
SO WE AGREE ON THE THE PART THAT WE NEED TO GET SOMETHING ON THE ON THE REMOTE TO FIND IT SOMEWHERE AND INCREASE IT THE DURABILITY OF OF THE THING
SO THE OTHER ASPECTS WE'LL JUST SEE HOW WHAT YOU CAME UP WITH AND WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR THAT BUDGET
OKAY
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
YEAH
OF COURSE HMM
YOU MEAN INTEGRATE THEM ALL INTO THE CIRCUIT BOARD
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
SO YOU HAVE
MM-HMM
OKAY
OKAY
THAT WAS IT
I'LL GET BACK TO MY THING THEN
UH
OKAY BACK THIS UP TO THE SCREEN
SO I GOT SOME NEW INFORMATION ON THE PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS ARE CHANGING A LITTLE
LIKE YOU SAID UH TELETEXT IS NOT NOT VERY POPULAR ANYMORE BECAUSE THE UH THE INTERNET
NOWADAYS PEOPLE DON'T USE THE TELETEXT ANYMORE OR HARDLY SO IT CAN EITHER
WELL I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD REMOVE THE BUTTON BECAUSE THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO ARE USING IT
BUT I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE VERY IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE BIG BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE
JUST PUT IT SOMEWHERE OR UNDER SECOND OPTION OR WHATEVER
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE
UM WE'RE TARGETING YOUNG PEOPLE NOW BECAUSE OUR UM
THIS IS A NEW PRODUCT AND WITH THIS NEW PRODUCT WE WANT TO APPEAL TO YOUNGER PEOPLE WHICH ARE UM THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WERE DEFINED UNDER FORTY
I SO I THINK IT'S THAT'S ALSO GOOD WITH THE FASHION AND EVERYTHING SO YEAH
THEY WANT TO PAY FOR IT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO SPEND MONEY ACTUALLY TO BUY A UM REMOTE THAT THEY LIKE
IF THEY LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS THE WAY IT FUNCTIONS SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA SPEND UH SPEND MONEY ON IT
YEAH
SEE HOW FAR WE CAN GO WITH IT ANYWAY SO AND ONE THING THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT IS THAT THE CORPORATE L COLOUR AND SLOGAN ARE RECOGNISABLE
WHICH IS APPARENTLY BLACK AND YELLOW BUT
I'M NOT SURE IF WE I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP THE THE LOGO IN MIND
BECAUSE WITH COLOURS YOU CAN UH HAVE A LOT OF UH FASHIONABLE COLOURS AND EVERYTHING ON IT WHICH SUITS EVERYBODY'S TASTE
SO
WITH THAT CONCEPT I STARTED THINKING
SO WHY NOT JUST STEAL NOKIA'S IDEA AND JUST MAKE CHANGEABLE COVERS FOR YOUR I MEAN THOSE COST HARDLY ANYTHING I THINK AND PEOPLE COULD EVEN SPEND EXTRA MONEY
ON BUYING A COVER AND SO HAVE AN ENTIRE NEW REMOTE CONTROL THAT THEY LIKE TO SEE
OR WE CAN SH FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT A BASIC DESIGN
AND SELL THE COVERS SEPARATELY FOR EXAMPLE
THAT'S JUST A LITTLE MARKETING IDEA THAT COULD BE APPLIED SO YOU CAN P IT APPEALS TO REALLY EVERYONE
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO I THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ENTIRE REMOTE CONTROLS
WE MAKE A BASIC ONE AND MANUFACTURE THIS COVER SEPARATELY
SO THAT WAS THAT WAS MY IDEA ON WHAT WE COULD DO TO APPEAL THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE
SO JUST
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAME UP WITH ANYTHING IN THE MEANTIME AFTER MAKING A PRESENTATION
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE
OKAY
OH YEAH
I THINK WE SHOULD LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN LIKE YOU SAID
I THINK FOR EXAMPLE IT'S IT'S HUGE I THINK THE L. C. D. IS HUGE IT CONSUMES BATTERIES LIKE HELL
I THINK IT TAKES UP A LOT OF A LOT OF POWER
IT COSTS A LOT I THINK
WHAT WE COULD DO WHAT COULD BE POSSIBLE IS MAYBE NOT AN L. C. D. SCREEN BUT WITH A PREVIEW BUT Y I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE
FOR EXAMPLE A LITTLE T. V. GUIDE
LIKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE JUST JUST A TEXT ONLY NOT COLOUR JUST A LITTLE TEXT THING SO YOU CAN USE YOUR REMOTE AS A T. V. GUIDE
I'M NOT SURE IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE BUT MAYBE OKAY MAKE IT YEAH FIND A LITTLE COMPROMISE IN THAT BUT WHAT DID I WRITE DOWN
I THINK THE P YEAH THE BEEP IS A VERY SIMPLE THING TO IMPLE IMPLEMENT
JUST MAKE A BUTTON ON YOUR T. V. AND JUST HIT THE BUTTON IT BEEPS SOMEWHERE
I THINK IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT WE SHOULD GO FOR THAT
UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
I THIN YEAH I MEAN WHERE ELSE SHOULD YOU PUT IT
YEAH BUT HOW ARE YOU GONNA USE THAT IF YOUR I MEAN IF YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IS LOST
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PRESS WHERE ARE YOU GONNA PRESS THE BUTTON
A SLAP ON STICKER
OH YOU MEAN AS LIKE A SEPARATE THING YOU CAN ATTACH TO YOUR T. V.
YEAH THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE
A LITTLE LITTLE BOX YOU CAN ATTACH TO YOUR T. V. IS FINE THEN OKAY
I THINK IT'S UNIVERSAL
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR UNIVERSAL BECAUSE APPARENTLY WE'RE A SEPARATE COMPANY MAKING SEPARATE C REMOTE CONTROLS TO SELL TO A LOT OF DIVERSE PEOPLE
I THINK UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
YEAH I THINK WE'RE TARGETING EVERYONE SO REMOTE
OKAY UNIVERSAL IS GOOD
SPEECH RECOGNITION I THINK IT'S VERY HARD BECAUSE WE'RE SELLING ACROSS MULTIPLE COUNTRIES
SO I THINK IMPLEMENTING SPEECH RECOGNITION IS SUCH A SMALL UM APPARATUS IT'S VERY HARD TO DO
YEAH BUT I DON'T SEE ARABIAN PEOPLE SPEAKING ONE TWO UH WHATEVER
IT'S YEAH
IT'S NOT A MATURE TECHNOLOGY I THINK IT TAKES A LOT OF MEMORY AND EVERYTHING IN IN A REMOTE CONTROL SO
I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A REMOTE CONTROL YET UH
WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE
UM WELL YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THE IN INTO THE MATERIALS THAT ARE REAL DURABLE
SO THE THE THE SYMBOLS WON'T FADE MAYBE A LITTLE HARDER PLASTIC OR ESPECIALLY LI WE DON'T MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE HAVE TO DO ALL THE BUTTONS
BUT ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT ARE UM THE POPULAR BUTTONS SO THOSE ALWAYS FADE FIRST
MM THE THING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE HAVE NOW
LET'S SEE
FOR EXAMPLE
WELL WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TARGETING OLDER PEOPLE WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT
EVERYTHING WE TARGET IS UNDER FORTY SO
YOU ASSUME THAT THAT THEY READ CORRECTLY AND I THINK THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE IS THAT THEY'RE REALLY SENSITIVE TO TO TRENDS THAT ARE PASSING THROUGH THE WORLD
SO
NO OF COURSE
NO I THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU YOU PUT OVER THEM BECAUSE YEAH WE C YEAH YOU CA WELL
THA THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT A BAD THAT'S NOT EVEN IT'S NOT EVEN A BAD IDEA
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE INTO THE DURABILITY ISSUE
YOU COULD FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUR BUTTONS ARE FADED
AFTER I MEAN IF YOU MAKE A DURABLE REMOTE THEY ARE FADED YOU CAN JUST BUY A NEW COVER
UH I'M NOT SURE IT'S IT'S HARD TO MAKE
SO IT'S A GOOD AND A BAD IDEA
MM-HMM
YEAH I KNOW IT'S JUST JUST A ONE ONE PIECE OF RUBBER FOR EXAMPLE OKAY
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SOMETHING I HAVE TO LOOK INTO
EITHER EITHER CHANGE BOTH THE BUTTONS AND AND THE COVER OR JUST THE COVER I'M NOT SURE WHICH WHICH IS EASIER SO
UM ANYWAY YEAH THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AFTERWARDS
JUST LUNCH BREAK AND HAVE MORE INDIVIDUAL WORK AFTER THAT SO LET'S SEE WHAT WE LET'S SEE WE
SO YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH A COMPONENTS CONCEPT YEAH
I WANT SOME YOU SHOULD DO SOME TREND WATCHING BECAUSE EVEN IF WE'RE IF WE'RE GONNA DO THOSE COVERS AND EVERYTHING WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IN THIS PHASE BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA BE THE ESSENTIAL FINAL DESIGN THAT WE'RE GONNA COME UP WITH
UM
YEAH I THINK USER INTERFACE IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS
I MEAN IT SHOULD BE VERY INTUITIVE S YEAH IT SHOULD SPEAK FOR ITSELF
UH FOR EXAMPLE I BOUGHT A REMOTE CONTROL LAST WEEK WITH A NEW T. V.
IT WAS IT L IT'S LIKE ALL BUTTONS AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT DOES AT FIRST AND I'M TOTAL T. V. NEW ANYWAY
SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE HAVE LESS OR L VERY LITTLE BUTTONS AND MAYBE A SECOND SECOND LEVEL MENU FOR THE ADVANCED THINGS
OR MAYBE JUST STICK 'EM UNDER A MENU LIKE YOU SAID THE UM THE SOUND OPTIONS AND THE SURROUND AND WHATEVER THEY'RE MORE COMPLICATED
JUST STICK 'EM UNDER ONE MENU AND UH GIVE IT A JUST PUT IT IN IN S IN A SOFTWARE PIECE
YOU CAN MENU AND YOU CAN UH SELECT EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO TO SET ON YOUR T. V.
THAT IS TRUE
NO THAT'S TRUE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT UH THERE'S A CHANCE IT'S NOT SO
A DOUBLE SIDED REMOTE CONTROL
I DON'T THINK THAT'S USEFUL
YEAH BUT THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF WASTED BUTTONS
FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A SONY T. V. AND THE HALF OF THE BUTTONS WON'T FUNCTION IF YOU HAVE A FOR A SONY THAT WON'T FOR A PHILIPS T. V.
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD YEAH FOR EXAM
I'M NOT S YEAH
FOR EX YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT A LITTLE DECISION BETWEEN THE PART IF YOU WANT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL THAT IT SHOULD DO WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY DO WITH THEIR T. V. S
NOT NOT THE VERY COMPLICATED SETTINGS THAT YOU CAN USUALLY DO THAT WITH UH EITHER A OLD OLD REMOTE CONTROL IF THEY REALLY HATE THAT THING BUT
YOU CAN'T YOU CANNOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THE DIFFERENT BRANDS OF T. V. S
I THINK THERE'S I THINK THERE IS A STANDARD FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN UH BECAUSE USUALLY THE THE MENU IS THE MENU BUTTON IS IS USABLE BETWEEN DIFFERENT BRANDS
ESPECIALLY THE BIG ONES THE BIG BRANDS SO
'CAUSE EVERYBODY I HAVE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL AND IT CAN USE THE MENU BUTTON
SO I THINK I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN PUT SOME RESEARCH INTO THAT IF IT'S POSSIBLE
UH I THINK JUST A B AND THE NAVIGATION IS VERY BASIC IT'S USUALLY THE SAME THING
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
I THINK SO UH WE NEED TO PUT SOME RESEARCH INTO THAT IF IF WE CAN OPEN THE MENU I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE JUST THE WAY HOW TO
YEAH THEN THEN YOU COULD DO EVERYTHING I SUPPOSE BECAUSE USUALLY THE T. V. S HAVE THA THAT INSIDE IN THIS OTHER LITTLE PIECE OF SOFTWARE SO IT'S OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH
YEAH I THINK IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE DISTINCT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IT'S EITHER IT'S BOTH MAYB MAYBE THE SHAPE CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE MORE CURVES OR WHATEVER
SO UM
YEAH THIS
NOT SURE WHAT BECAUSE WE HAVE FORTY MINUTES I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE LEFT FOR THE MEETING ANYWAY SO
YEAH BUT IT WASN'T ME IT WAS HIM CLOSING SOMETHING
SO ANYWAY YEAH WE COULD DO SOME I DO SOME WORK NOW ON ON THE DESIGN FOR EXAMPLE
I MEAN WHAT DO YOU WANT DO YOU WANT BUT
YEAH MAY MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
BUT THOUGH SMOOTH INSIDE
SO YOU HAVE THE TRANSMITTER HERE FOR EXAMPLE
LET'S SEE THAT YOU WHAT WOULD BE HANDY
I THINK THAT THE THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE THE CHANNEL BUTTONS SHOULD BE UH ON THEIR OWN
LET'S SEE ONE TWO GOD DAMN IT
YEAH OKAY
ANOTHER ONE HERE
LET'S SEE WHAT I THINK THIS SHOULD THESE ARE ALWAYS ON TOP OF THE OF THE CONTROL SO THEY SHOULD BE HERE
THINK IT'S LIKE THIS
WITHI WITHIN THE YEAH JUST TAKE IT
DO YOU TAKE TRIANGLES OR
UM I THINK IT SHOULD BE I THINK IT MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE 'EM BIGGER OR WHATEVER
YEAH
YEAH IN THE MIDDLE
IT'S IT'S USUALLY UH THERE BUT
MM
YEAH BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S LOST IN YOUR ARMCHAIR WE'LL NOT SEE THE FLASH
AND FLASH TAKES UP A LOT OF BATTERIES AGAIN
YEAH
YEAH I THOUGHT ABOUT FOR DEAF PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE SO
WE COULD DO THAT
UH LET'S SEE
OH YEAH IT'S TRUE
UM THAT THING SHOULD BE CENTRAL
YOU SHOULDN'T BE YOU UH SHOULDN'T PRESS IT BY ACCIDENT BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE STACKED AWAY SOMEWHERE
YEAH
YEAH LIKE THAT'S GONNA WORK
YEAH I THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD MOVE THE BUTTONS DOWN AND PUT IT HERE FOR EXAMPLE TO
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YOU SHOULD I THINK THE BU THE POWER BUTTON SHOULD BE ON TOP 'CAUSE IT'S THE FIRST THING YOU DO TURN IT ON
SO POWER BUTTON ON TOP
UM
MUTE
DO WE HARDLY I THINK IT SHOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM SOMEWHERE
MUTE
TURN THE SOUND OFF
I DON'T THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUT I THINK IT I THINK IT SHOULD BE YOU C YOU COULD PUT IT SOMEWHERE HERE
NO BECAUSE IT YEAH PEOPLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THAT IT'S
CAN I HAVE THAT
THAT'S J
TAKE THIS OUT AND HERE SEE
UH ARE WE GONNA TAKE TRIANGLES ANYWAY
I'M DRAWING TRIANGLES BUT
YEAH IT'S MAYBE A BIGGER LESSER THAN THING
SO ANYWAY I THINK THIS IS SHOULD BE
THE CHANNELS AND OR SH
HERE OKAY
OKAY SHOULD WE CHAN OKAY THIS TWO CHANNEL
UP AND DOWN
WELL FOR THAT IS IT'S ON ONE PART IT'S UM IT'S A GOOD THING TO RECHARGE IT
MAYBE WE SHOULD WHAT WHAT COULD BE POSSIBLE IS ONE WITH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES FOR EXAMPLE
YOU HAVE JUST PUT PENLITE BATTERIES THAT ARE RECHARGEABLE BECAUSE IT'S AN IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY ANNOYING
I'M NOT SURE Y I'M NOT SURE IT'S IF IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT JUST TAKE A LOOK AT IT BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE A VERY GOOD IDEA
BECAUSE IF IT'S IT'S UH USEFUL TO HAVE IT RECHARGEABLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME
IF YOU DON'T WANT RECHA IF YOU FORGOT TO RECHARGE IT AND YOU WANNA WATCH T. V. NOW
YOU WANNA BE ABLE TO PUT DIFFERENT BATTERIES IN IT USE IT NOW AND NOT IN HALF AN HOUR
HOW ABOUT
I THINK I HAVE A NICE IDEA
NOT EXACTLY UH
I THINK IT'S UH IT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA TO HAVE UH LIKE SORT OF A MAYBE A BASE STATION THAT YOU PUT ON THE T. V.
COULD BE FLAT YOU COULD INSERT YOUR UH REMOTE INTO IT
I'M NOT SURE
A WHAT
WELL
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE WANTED TO INSERT EITHER A BEEP OR A FLASH INTO THE THING WITH A LITTLE SEPARATE SIGNAL OR SO YOU COULD PUT THAT ON A T. V. FOR EXAMPLE
IT COULD BE VERY FLAT COULD BE VERY SMALL
IT'S A VERY SMALL YEAH I'M DRAWING IT BIG NOW BUT SO YOU CAN PUT YOUR REMOTE ON FLAT FOR EXAMPLE
AND AT THE BACKSIDE OF REMOTE JUST JUST JUST A LITTLE HOLE
FOR EXAMPLE UM YOU JUST PUT IT DOWN IT RECHARGES FOR EXAMPLE
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE
I'M NOT SURE IF IT COSTS A LOT THAT THAT'S WHAT HE R
THAT'S THAT YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU BUY YOURSELF
IT'S JUST AN IDEA WE HAVE TO FIND OUT IF IT'S POSSIBLE
DO THEY WANT BUT THEY WANT A RECHARGEABLE ONE
I'M NOT SURE YOU SHOULD FIND OUT IF IT'S IF RECHARGEABLE IS IMPORTANT
YEAH
THEY WANT TO PAY FOR COMFORT
WE JUST ASSU WE WE COULD EITHER MAKE A SEPARATE STATION WHICH JUST SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE CONTROL TO EITHER BEEP OR FLASH TO FIND IT
UM AND
YEAH WE HAVE TO EITHER THAT OR MAKE IT INTEGRATED WITH A WITH A DOCKING STATION
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD ACTUALLY
I LIKE THE BEEP PART ANYWAY
SO UM LET'S GO THROUGH THE
COVERS IS COVERS IS GOOD
YEAH IT'S OH WE CAN SAVE THIS
UP AND SAVED
WE EVEN SAVED THE ANT
UM
OKAY
SO WHAT WE HAVE IS YOU HAVE I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT OF WORK ON IF IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE COST
MAYBE YEAH OR MAYBE YOU CAN FIND OUT I WHAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY
WE ARE GOING FOR TWENTY FIVE EUROS SALES PRICE BUT JUST TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY MORE
WE COULD LOSE A LITTLE PROFIT AND MAYBE ATTRACT MORE CUSTOMERS UH WE JUST HAVE TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
YEAH IF YOU HAVE SOME FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT THAT'D BE NICE SO
HMM
NO IT WASN'T WASN'T ALLO IT WAS POSSIBLE NOT ALLOWED SO
SO THAT'S UM WHY I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SHARE DOCUMENTS ON THE ON THE DRAFT
I DON'T CARE
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY COMPLAINTS YET SO
UM
YEAH THE OH THEY INC UH THEY INCLUDE THE NEW ONE
OR JUST FOR YOU
OH NO I DIDN'T HAVE THAT
ALL IT TELLS JUST LET'S MAKE MAKE A NEW TICK THE NEW ONE
UM OTHER SIDE
YEAH LET'S INCREASE IT A LITTLE BECAUSE
YEAH DRAW US UP SOME SOME DESIGNS OF OF POSSIBLE JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THE IMPORTANT BUTTONS SHOULD BE ON TOP AND EITHER BIG
SO THE MORE LESS IMPORTANT
MORE OR LESS
JUST PLAY A LITTLE WITH THIS PUT L SHIFT A LITTLE UP OR DOWN AND WE'LL SEE WHAT LOOKS BEST
OR JUST PO POST YOUR DESIGNS FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE PRODUCT SHARE
YEAH SO WE DON'T WANT WE WANT VERY LITTLE BUTTONS JUST THE BUTTONS YOU USE A LOT
WELL WHAT WE HAD FUNCTION THAT WHAT PEOPLE DO SO
PEOPLE CHANGE CHANNELS PEOPLE THEY CHANGE THE VOLUME AND THEY THEY CHANGE CHANNEL THEY TURN T. V. OFF AND ON FOR EXAMPLE
THAT'S THE BASIC FU THAT'S WHAT YOU DO I'M NOT SURE WHO PRESENT THAT AGAIN
BUT THOSE ARE THE BASIC FUNCTION THAT PEOPLE USE IT FOR SO THOSE SHOULD BE VERY WELL REPRESENTED
THAT'S TRUE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE STICK UNDER THE MENU BUTTON
EVERYTHING IS YOU SAY IN EVERY T. V. THAT'S CONFIGURED UNDER THE MENU
YEAH BUT
BUT I THINK MOST MODERN T. V. S HAVE IT IN THEIR MENU
UH WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH
UNDER FORTY
YEAH
MM-HMM
YEAH YEAH
THE WANT TO PAY FOR OH
UH SHALL WE
YOUNGER AGE SIXTEEN AND FORTY FIVE
THAT'S ALL HERE HERE IT SAYS
YEAH AGE SIXTEEN FORTY FI INTEREST IN MAIN FEATURES MORE CRITICAL
OKAY SO WE'RE NOT FOCUSING ON THIS
UM
ALL THE INTEREST IN FEATURES NOT REALLY THE L. C. OH HERE
WOULD YOU PAY FOR UH SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
HMM OKAY
SPEECH RECOGNITION IS QUITE
YEAH JUST LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES THEN BECAUSE IF APPARENTLY IT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LUXURIOUS REMOTE MAYBE IT'S NOT EVEN THAT EXPENSIVE
OR FIND A COMPROMISE MAYBE JUST A BLACK AND WHITE OR FOR SOME EXTRA INFORMATION ON IT ON YOUR PROGRAMMES
ME TOO
I MEAN WE ALL DO
RIGHT
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD PUT INTO CONSIDERATION
APPARENTLY IT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT SO
WE SHOULD SEE IF WHAT IT COSTS IF IT'S POSSIBLE
YEAH
YEAH WE SHOULD DO A LITTLE THING ABOUT DESIGN BECAUSE IT LOOKS BORING REALLY TO ME
EVEN IF YOU PUT IT EVEN IF YOU PUT A DIFFERENT COVER ON IT IT LOOKS STILL LOOKS BORING SO
I HAVE NO CLUE
I JUST DREW SOMETHING WHAT WHICH WOULD FIT INTO YOUR HAND EASILY
I THINK IT'S A VERY
SORRY
YEAH
OKAY
MM-HMM
YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO J JUST KEEP IN MIND IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HEAVY
I MEAN WE CAN STICK IT IN IN THERE I THINK
HUH EVEN IF IN THE WORST CASE WE CAN EVEN COULD YOU GIVE ME THE PEN BACK
SO LET'S SAY THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT AN L. C. D. THING
LET'S TAKE TAKE THE BASIC DESIGN AGAIN WHAT WE OH CRAP UH CAME UP WITH
I'LL JUST MAKE IT A LITTLE BIGGER NOW
SO A TRANSMITTER HERE
ANYWAY
WE COULD LET'S SAY WE HAVE AN L. C. D. SCREEN PEOPLE WANT AN L. C. D. SCREEN
SO THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY PUT IT HERE
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE REALLY BIG BUT JUST JUST HAVE TO BE HAS TO BE THERE
THINK IT'S A GOOD PLACE PEOPLE DON'T
NO
IT'S NOT THAT UH IT'S NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IT'S JUST AN EXTRA THING
IT JUST YOU PRESS THE BUTTONS ON TOP BECAUSE YOUR FINGER IS ON TOP
HOW CAN YOU USE AN L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH BUT WHY I I'M NOT SURE
UH IF YOU T IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON YOU CAN SEE IT RI I'M NOT SURE WHA I'M TRYING TO IMAGINE MYSELF WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE
YOU WOULD PREFER IT N OKAY
SO WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE SAYING IT SHOULD BE ON TOP
OKAY BUT THEN YOU WOULD WOULD S HAVE TO STACK AWAY YOUR BUTTONS SOMEWHERE ELSE
ANYWAYS
UH THIS LOOKS A LITTLE
ABOUT THE L. C. D. S THING
WELL IF IT IF IT'S IF IT'S POSSIBLE WI IF IT'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE WE SHOULD INCLUDE IT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S COOL
UH WE HAVE GREEN NOW UH
OR MAYBE WE SHOULD M WE COULD UH DRAW DRAW SOMETHING A BIT THAT HAS IT ON ON ON THE BOTTOM
MAYBE IN A CIRCLE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WE LIKE IN THIS EXAMPLE
I THINK THIS IS NOT GOOD BUT FOR WE COULD MAKE CIRCULAR BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE
FOR UP AND DOWN MA MAKE IT A CIRCLE ON IT BECAUSE IT
I THINK THE CHANNEL BUTTON SHOULD BE IN THE CENTRE
CHANNEL BUTTON SHOULD BE ST STICK TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN THIS SECTION
BECAUSE IT'S UH
WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THE SIZE ANYWAY JUST A GENERAL DESIGN
YOU CAN MAKE IT AS BIG AS YOU WANT
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU TAKE UH
NO LET'S SEE
FOR EXAMPLE JUST
YEAH
I DON'T THINK IF WE IF WE EVEN USE AN L. C. D. SCREEN WE NEED TO DEFINITELY
YEAH BUT WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE SI WHAT THE SIZE IS
THE L. C. D. DOESN'T HAVE TO NEE DOESN'T NEED TO BE VERY BIG
MM LET'S SEE
FINISH MEETING NOW
OKAY WE WILL
SO EITHER
WE EITHER WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT
EITHER THIS ONE THIS THIS COULD BE THE LUXURIOUS ONE
SO WE HAVE CHANNEL BUTTONS HERE
I'M JUST DRAWING SOMETHING UH
UH
I THINK THIS WOULD THIS WOULD LOOK COOL
YOU COULD HAVE IT FOR EXAMPLE
SMALL BUTTONS HERE FOR SOME EXTRA FUNCTIONS SO IF YOUR BASIC FUNCTION'S HERE WE SHOULD LIKE WE DECIDED BEFORE PROGRAMMES UP AND DOWN
AND VOLUME HERE
WELL YOU CAN JUST NO I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN DO THAT BUT WE COULD PUT A MICROPHONE IN HERE FOR EXAMPLE
JUST TO DO RESEARCH INTO BOTH W WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT IT TAKES FOR SPACE
BUT LET'S CUT THE MEETING FOR NOW YES
YEAH LET'S THINK OF A NAME OKAY
UH OKAY
OKAY AT ANYWAYS THE THE MINUTES WILL BE ON THE ON THE WEB SHORTLY SO THERE WE GO UH
YEAH TO ALL
OH THERE HE IS
GO AHEAD
THAT'S PRETTY SHOCKING UH
WHICH CHANNEL SELECTION
OH OKAY
IS THAT MANAGEABLE
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS PRETTY EXPENSIVE TOO
OKAY
OKAY
SHALL I GO
OKAY
SO SOME TECHNICAL FUNCTIONS
BASICALLY I HAVE SOME ISSUES WHICH YOU DISCUSSED EARLIER
UH LET'S JUST START WITH THE METHOD
IT SOUNDS REALLY EASY WHAT DOES THE USER DO WHAT DOES THE TH REMOTE CONTROL DO BUT THERE ARE QUITE SOME ISSUES
SO THE THINGS I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON ARE THE USER ASPECT BECAUSE THE TECHNICAL ASPECT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH COVERED
WE CAN DO THAT
WHAT GOES WRONG
AT THE USER
GETS THE REMOTE CONTROL
WHERE IS THE REMOTE CONTROL
WE'VE ALL HAD IT ONCE I WANT TO WATCH SOME TELEVISION WHERE'S THE REMOTE CONTROL
THAT WAS ONE OF YOUR IDEAS WHICH YOU POSTED IN THE NETWORK FOLDER A REALLY GOOD IDEA
UH THESE ARE JUST THE ISSUES
I COME TO SOME UH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FINDINGS POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS LATER
SEARCHES FOR THE BUTTON
THERE ARE MANY BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH ARE NOT CLEAR
UH SO EITHER WE LOSE THOSE OR WE TRY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR
UH ALSO SYMBOLS TEND TO FADE AFTER A WHILE
THERE'S NOTHING MORE ANNOYING THAN FADED SYMBOLS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH CHANNEL IS THIS BUTTON SO POSSIBLY WE COULD FIND UH SOMETHING FOR THAT YES
UH COVERED THAT
OH YES USER PRESSES THE BUTTON
UM USUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS BUTTONS ARE SMALL
SO YOU PRESS MORE ONCE REMOTE CONTROL GOES
KABLOUEY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION NOT TO PUT TOO MUN TOO MANY BUTTONS ON UH THE REMOTE CONTROL
AND POSSIBLY ALSO THE SIZE SO MORE IMPORTANT BUTTONS BIGGER SI
SO THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT I H HAD IN MIND IN THE FADE PROOF SYMBOLS LOCATOR A SOUND UH SO CLEAR WE SHOULD STICK TO EXISTING SYMBOLS
BUT MAYBE WE COULD DO A LITTLE UH INVESTIGATION TO SEE WHETHER SOME SYMBOLS ARE UH NEED TO BE REPLACED BY OTHERS
UH
THIS I PRETTY MUCH COVERED
SO WHAT WE WANT TO GO TO IS NOT THIS ONE BUT MORE LESS BUTTONS EASY SOME BIGGER BUTTONS
SO THAT'S BASICALLY UH WHAT I HAD IN MIND
THIS IS NOT THE FINAL DESIGN THIS IS JUST A GENERAL IDEA OF HOW I'D LIKE TO SEE UH BASICALLY THE GENERAL IDEA
SO THAT WAS IT
YEAH I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
OH
IS IT MANAGEABLE
IS IT EASY
YEAH
AND IT COSTS TOO MUCH TO FABRICATE SO WE'RE ON A TIGHT BUDGET HERE
AND IT'S
MAYBE JUST A SLAP ON STICKER WITH A BUTTON WHICH SENDS OUT A SMALL SIGNAL
YEAH EXACTLY
AND IT'S
BESIDES THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T REALLY SUPER YET SO THAT IS A PROBLEM IN IMPLEMENTING THIS
IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT IT'S JUST NOT I DON'T THINK THE MARKET'S RIPE FOR THAT YET
BUT SHOULD THE EXCHANGEABLE COVERS INCLUDE THE BUTTONS THEMSELVES OR JUST THE
C THAT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE WITH THE TEXT THEN
OH YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
YEAH
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD
IS IT TECHNI TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE TO UH SEND A SIGNAL TO A TELEVISION AND THEN POPS UP A MENU
BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF TELEVISION SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THAT
IT'S AN IN BUILT MENU ISN'T IT
YES
SO BASICALLY WE
OR WE COULD USE A DOUBLE SIDED FOR LESS USED FUNCTIONS YOU
YEAH WITH THE COVER
I IT'S BASICALLY AN IDEA TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES BECAUSE
NO BUT BASIC FUNCTIONS BUT FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE NOT FREQUENTLY USED
BECAUSE IF WE USE A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MOST BUTTONS ON IT SO
YEAH
YEAH I HAVE SOME IDEAS
I HAVE SOME IDEAS
I'LL PUT SOME ON PAPER AND PRESENT THEM NEXT TIME UH THE IDEAS THAT I HAVE
I HEARD A BEEP GO
YEAH BUT WE LIKE SOME SOME CURVES OR
YEAH
OH WE GET THE GENERAL IDEAS YES
YEAH AND SINCE YOU'RE HOLDING IT LIKE THIS I SUGGEST YOU PUT THE CHANNEL UP CHANNEL DOWN AND VOLUME YEAH YEAH
SO YOU HAVE THE UP CHANNEL
THE DOWN CHANNEL THE VOLUME DO WE WANT THAT HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SO
YEAH BUT THIS IS JUST A G GENERAL IDEA
UH MAYBE THE MENU BUTTON CAN GO I IN THE MIDDLE
WHOA
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND IT
WE COULD MAKE A COMBINATION THAT IT GOES BEEP AND THAT YOU THAT SOME LIGHT LIGHTS UP
SO WE HAVE THE BASIC CHANNELS WE'VE GOT HERE UH THE POWER BUTTON
SOMEWHERE OVER HERE
I USUALLY
PRESS IT ON TOP
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO
OKAY MUTE BUTTON
IS THAT SOMEWHERE HERE
IS THAT USED OFTEN
THE MUTE BUTTON
DO PEOPLE USE THAT OFTEN
'CAUSE UH I'M PRETTY MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO IT RIGHT OVER HERE AT LEAST IN GENERAL BUT
IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT NO
SURE
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO AREN'T THEY
WELL I'M ACCUSTOMED TO THE CHANNELS BEING ON TOP
BUT ISN'T THAT EXPENSIVE IN THE ENTIRE PACKAGE
BUT AGAIN ISN'T THAT TOO EXPENSIVE
'CAUSE THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES A DOCKING STATION
AND DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT THAT
TO PAY EXTRA THEY WANT TO PAY FOR RECHARGEABLE
CAN CAN WE SAVE THIS OR
YEAH
COULD YOU POST SOME OTHER ESSENTIALS OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT SO THAT I CAN WORK WITH SOME BUTTONS WHERE TO PUT IT
YOU SEEM TO HAVE INFORMATION ON THAT I'D LIKE TO UH
SEE SOME OF IT
NO IT'S NOT
NO
OH YOUR COMPUTER
OKAY
WELL I HAVE YOUR POWERPOINT PRESENTATION I CAN GET SOME INF INFORMATION OUT OF THAT
LET'S SEE
OH WHERE WOULD WE
WHERE WOULD WE WANT THE UH TELETEXT BUTTON
BECAUSE WE DECIDED THAT IT'S N NOT THAT IMPORTANT
DO WE PUT IT SOMEWHERE OVER HERE
OR MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING FOR THE NEXT MEETING I CAN DRAW OUT SOME IDEAS
YEAH
WELL WE HAVE DECIDED MORE OR LESS THE BASIC STRUCTURE
I CAN PUT THE OTHER BUTTONS IN
YEAH
YEAH
MAYBE ANOTHER IDEA UH
YES BUT IT SHOULD COVER ALL THE FUNCTIONS SO POSSIBLY JUST AN IDEA THAT POPPED IN
YEAH BUT WE COULD GO A STEP FURTHER BECAUSE SOME T. V. S HAVE THE UH POSSIBILITY TO ADJUST BRIGHTNESS THAT KIND OF MENUS
YES BUT IT
BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING
WE NEED TO ADJUST TO THE TECHNOLOGY
TRUE
NO I THI
OH WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE THEN WITH AN L. C. D. SCREEN
WELL I DOUBT IT BUT
WELL I HAD BASICALLY
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
TO MAKE IT KIND OF FUTURISTIC
SO WHAT KIND OF
YEAH SURE
NOW IT'S PRETTY MUCH TUCKED AWAY IN YOUR HAND
I'M
I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED OF THE
YEAH
SO BASICALLY CAN I WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE NOW IS UH WHAT GOES ON TOP
DO WE PUT THE VOLUME CONTROL AND THE CHANNEL CONTROL HERE OR DO WE PUT IT ON HE WOULD WE LIKE TO PRESS IT IN THE MIDDLE
YES BUT WE DO AGREE THAT WE KEEP THIS AT THE CENTRE BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION
WELL THAT WOULD MAKE THEM QUITE SMALL
SO MAYBE YOU'D PUT THEM HERE
YES BUT A BIG REMOTE CONTROL PROBABLY NOT SOMETHING WHICH PEOPLE WOULD LIKE
SO WOULD WE LIKE THIS OR WOULD WE LIKE THE
LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE HERE
OKAY
SO I THINK OF A NAME
SO
YES GO AND FINISH UP AND I'LL SEE YOU AT LUNCH
YEAH
OKAY WE
MM
OKAY THAT'S FINE
UM
OKAY NOW WORK A LITTLE WITH ME
OKAY
WELL LET'S START IT AS IT IS
OKAY UH THE METHOD
THERE ARE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED UH YOU ALREADY UH TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT
WHICH BUTTONS ARE WANTED UH IS OUR REMOTE CONTROL UNIVERSAL OR SHOULD IT BE PROGRAMMABLE
UH IF IT SHOULD BE PROGRAMMEAB GRAMMEALE THEN WE NEED UM SOMETHING LIKE A MODE THAT YOU CAN SWITCH IT
BECAUSE THEN THE BUTTONS HAVE TO SEND OUT A DIFFERENT SIGNAL THEN THEY WOULD NORMALLY DO
AND UH HOW BIG IS THE REMOTE CONTROL UH GOING TO BE
I'LL TELL YOU WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME
UM THERE ARE A LOT OF TECHNICAL PARTS IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
SO UH UH THAT'S WHY I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SAY UH GO A LITTLE BIT EASY ON THE DESIGNS
UH I HEARD AB UH YOU TALKING ABOUT BEEPS AND ABOUT UH VIDEO SCREENS BUT UH THE MATERIAL INSIDE AND THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS ARE QUITE COMPLEX ALREADY
SO KEEP IN MIND THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU KEEP UH THINK OF IT HAS TO B TO BE BUILT
SO IT'S THAT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT S MIGHT LOOK LIKE
UH MATERIAL STUDY I'M WORKING ON THAT UM FOR THE THE COSTS
I HAVE TO CHECK OUT HOW FAR I CAN GO WITH THAT
NORMALLY A CIRCUIT BOARD IS MADE OF FIBREGLASS UH AND THE WIRES ARE MADE OF COPPER
UH THAT IS HOW IT IS DONE AND ALL THE REMOTE CONTROLS WORK THAT WAY I THINK WE CAN JUST GO ON WITH THAT
UM THEN I'VE READ MORE INTEGRATION OF MATERIALS MEANS LESS COST FOR THE PRODUCTION
THE MORE WE CAN MAKE UH AT ONCE UH IN ONE PIECE UH THAT IS CHEAPER
EXACTLY SO IF WE MAKE A CIRCUIT BOARD WITH THE THE CONNECTIONS ALREADY ON IT THEN THAT'S CHEAPER
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT IN DESIGN AGAIN
THIS IS WHAT LOOK LIKE UH LOOKS LIKE IF YOU PRESS ONE BUTTON SO THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRE THING
YOU HAVE THE THE POWER COMING IN THEN YOU HAVE LIKE A SWITCH
THE SWITCH UH UH UH IF YOU P PRESS IT THEN SOME ELECTRICAL CHARGE GOES INTO THE PROCESSOR
THAT THINKS OVER A MORSE CODE THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD SEE IT
THE MORSE CODE GOES TO THE AMPLIFIER THEN UH THE SIGNAL IS SENT TO TWO UH LIGHT BULBS
YOU HAVE INFRARED AND AN INTERV UM UH HOW TO SAY IT
UH A LIGHT IN INDICATION LIGHT THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S FUNCTIONING
UH HERE AGAIN THAT'S MY STORY ABOUT THE DIFFERENT MODES IF YOU DO WANT TO MAKE REMOTE UH UNIVERSAL
THEN THE PROCESSOR HAS TO UH MAKE UP A DIFFERENT MORSE CODE WHEN SOME BUTTON IS PRESSED
THAT MAKES IT MUCH MORE COMPLEX SO WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A LOOK DO WE WANT THAT OR NOT
UH I DON'T HAVE ANY PERSONAL P UH PREFERENCES UH SO FAR EXCEPT FOR UH THE MATERIALS TO BE USED UH LIGHT THAT THEY ARE LIGHT
THAT WAS IT
HMM
YEAH
MM-HMM
HMM
NO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA
BUT
GO AHEAD
Y
YES I THINK SO TOO
YEAH
OKAY UH
MM
HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
I HAVE TO CHECK THAT OUT I'M NOT SURE
THAT MUST BE POSSIBLE
JA
I'M SORRY WHE WHERE DO YOU WANNA HIT THE T. YOU WANNA WE WANT A BUTTON ON THE TELEVISION
IN TH OKAY BUT THAT RULES OUT A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE UH
UH
YEAH
EXACTLY
OKAY THEN UH I'D I'D LIKE TO KNOW NOW IF WE WANT THE UH UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL OR NOT BECAUSE THAT'S UH DETERMINES EVERYTHING I'M GONNA DO
IF NOT OKAY
OKAY THEN I GO FOR THAT
YEAH
OKAY
NO IT'S FINE WITH ME BUT THEN I KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR
UH-HUH
MM-HMM
EXACTLY
I ALREADY NOTED THAT
MM OKAY
OKAY
HMM
IF WE UH MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH CHANGEABLE COVERS THEN WE CAN ALSO MAKE UH A COVER FOR EVERY LANGUAGE AREA
THAT'S FO IS UH ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN READ IT READ IT IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE
THAT'S OKAY OKAY
HUH
UH OKAY
HMM
HMM
MM
OKAY
UH BUT I KNOW THAT THE BUTTONS ARE LIKE A NOKIA TELEPHONE ON UH ONE SLEEVE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE COVER
UH WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN ONLY REMOVE THE SLEEVE
KNOW WHAT I MEAN
IT WORKS THE SAME AS A NOKIA TELEPHONE IT'S IT'S IN MY UH 'KAY
EXACTLY
HMM
MM
YEAH
I DON'T THINK SO
NO I DON'T THINK SO
BECAUSE THE TELEVISION NEEDS TO RESPOND TO THE SIGNAL AND IF IT DOESN'T KNOW HOW IT'S EXACTLY THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE
HMM
MM
MM
BUT THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
MM OKAY
MM
BUT I THINK THERE MUST BE A WAY UH TO INVOKE THE MORE COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS OF A TELEVISION
FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR OLD REMOTE CONTROL IS BROKEN AND YOU BUY OURS
THEN UH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF THE TELEVISION THAT'S IN IT
BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'LL LOSE FUNCTIONS BY BUYING OUR
OKAY I THI I THINK SO TOO
AND I THINK THAT OUR R REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD NOT LOOK LIKE UH ANY OTHER
FOR INSTANCE UH SONY MAKES ALL THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS EXACTLY THE SAME FOR ALL THEIR DEVICES
AND YOU ALWAYS GRAB THE WRONG ONE BECAUSE FORMATTING OF THE BUTTONS IS EXACTLY THE SAME ONLY THE LABELS ARE DIFFERENT
WE SHOULD NOT DO THAT
EXACTLY
MM THAT'S YOUR UH DIVISION
HMM
YEAH
PERHAPS WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE UH SOMETHING LIKE A FLASH ON IT IF YOU IF IT'S LOST FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE DEAF
THEY THEY WON'T HEAR THE THE BEEP
YEAH
UH
YEAH IT'S TRUE BUT IT'S IT'S ONLY HAS TO DO SO WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON THAT IT'S LOST
SO
DEAF PEOPLE
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S POSSIBLE
MM
YEAH ME TOO
SHALL WE UH ALSO LOOK IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE A RECHARGEABLE REMOTE
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY NEW BATTERIES IF EVERY
MM YEAH
UH
BUT THAT'S ALREADY POSSIBLE
YES
YES
OKAY
UH YOU COULD MAKE A DEVICE BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT UH IS POSSIBLE WITH THE COSTS THAT YOU CAN PUT IN NORMAL BATTERIES
RECHARGEABLE BUT IT YOU'RE THE REMOTE ALSO CAN ACT AS A RECHARGER
SO THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE YOU HAVE EVERY DECISION
KNOW WHAT I MEAN
YOU CAN UH PUT IN NORMAL PENLITES RECHARGEABLE PENLITES BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE RECHARGED WITH THE REMOTE WITH A WIRE
SO BUT
BUT I THINK THAT WILL COST A LOT
UH A NORMAL WIRE WOULD BE BETTER
LIKE A LIKE A P. D. A. A HAND HELD
YOU CAN UH JUST PUT IT IN THE ELECTRICITY AND IT CHARGES ITSELF YOU DON'T NEED BASIC STATION
YES
THAT IS POSSIBLE THAT'S TRUE
MM
YEAH
YEAH
MM
YES
I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND THAT OUT
I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THIS BUT
HMM
THESE ARE UH COMFORT ISSUES
SO I THINK PEOPLE WILL PAY THEY WANTED TO PAY FOR COMFORT
WELL THIS IS COMFORT
YES
HMM
YEAH
EXACTLY
I THINK THIS IS A BRILLIANT PRODUCT
I WOULD BUY IT MYSELF
UH
I LIKE THE COVERS
THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA
I NEVER THOUGHT
I HOPE IF I HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT I'M GONNA
MM
YEAH
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A DECISION
WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT KIND OF MATERIALS THAT WE CAN UH CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT IN IT AND EXACTLY I NEED IT
WAS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO UH SEND EMAILS AROUND THE OFFICE
NOT
YEAH OKAY
WHAT UH WHAT DID YOU WANNA SAY
MM
MM
MM
BUT THAT'S THE QUESTION IS IT
BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED IN THE TELEVISION UNDER THE MENU
IF IT ISN'T THEN WE CANNOT REACH IT
I THINK SO TOO
I THINK SO TOO
UH ISN'T THERE A POSSIBILITY TO DO RESEARCH ON THAT SO WE KNOW THAT FOR SURE
IF YOU RULE OUT FUNCTIONS THEN UH AND THAT GETS KNOWN THEN PEOPLE ARE NOT GONNA BUY IT
THEN THE CONSUMER BOND OR SOMETHING SAYS UH YOU CANNOT DO THIS AND THAT WITH IT
THAT'S A BAD BAD COM COMMERCIAL FOR OKAY
THAT'S TRUE
HMM
HMM
DID THEY REALLY SAID IT LIKE THAT
THOSE TWO THINGS
DO THEY REALISE HOW MUCH THAT COSTS
THAT'S ALMOST UNDOABLE
NO THAT'S THAT'S
EVEN IF I IF WE HAVE THIS LOST UNIT THEN WE CANNOT DO IT FOR THAT PRICE
YEAH THAT'S TRUE
MM
HMM
UH
UH I
BUT I REALLY NEED FINANCE INFORMATION
WE ALL DO
MM
UH
HMM
AND THE DESIGN IT SHOULD DIFFER
THIS IS PHILIPS HUH
PHILIPS HAS THIS
OKAY
HMM
UH
MM
OH I REALISE IF WE MAKE IT SMALL THEN IT NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE THICKER BECAUSE I NEED TO PUT ALL THE ELECTRONICS IN IT
IF WE MAKE IT S UH SMALLER UH LESS WIDE
THEN WE NEED TO M MAKE IT A LITTLE THICKER BECAUSE I HAVE TO PUT ALL THE ELECTRONICS IN IT
NO
HMM
ME TOO
AH BUT
HMM
NO
M I PERSONALLY WOULD PREFER IT ON THE TOP
HUH
BUT IT
HMM
MM
HMM
THEY WANT IT UH
WE SHOULD JUST TRY TO MAKE THAT IF IT'S POSSIBLE
IF IT IS POSSIBLE WE SHOULD REALLY DO IT BUT WE NEED THAT INFORMATION
ALSO KEEP IN MIND AGAIN THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS VERY FLAT BUT IT NEEDS TRANSISTORS RESISTORS I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE AND THAT NEEDS SPACE
SO I HAVE TO LOOK IF THAT'S POSSIBLE
BUT IF WE
HMM
HMM
IF WE HAVE A A SPACE ISSUE WE CAN ALSO LOSE ONE BATTERY
IT IS RECHARGEABLE SO WE CAN STICK WITH ONE INSTEAD OF TWO
THAT MIGHT BE AN OPTION
YEAH BUT IF WE NEED TWO BATTERIES AND AN L. C. D. SCREEN THAT MEANS A LOT OF SPACE THAT WE NEED
BUT IT HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER
OKAY
NO BUT THE THINGS BEHIND IT
SPACE
LIKE A PROCESS UH
I LIKE THIS ONE MORE
MM
MM
I'LL TRY TO
ONE MORE UH THING I'D LIKE TO SAY UH LET'S GIVE THIS UH A NAME
AND NOT LIKE SOME VAGUE SERIAL NUMBER THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS LIKE WITH CARS
SHALL WE ALL TRY UH TO THINK ABOUT A NAME
GOOD LUCK
YEAH I'VE DO WE UH SAVE THE
YES
SORRY A LITTLE BIT OF PL LITTLE PROBLEM WITH COMPUTER
UH
YEAH SURE NO PROBLEM
UM THERE WAS A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH MY COMPUTER SO NOT UH THE WHOLE UH PRESENTATION UH
YEAH
UM
OKAY AND
I WANT TO OPEN THE MY S OH NO
OH NO THAT'S OKAY
UH SLIDE SHOW
YES
THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS IT'S UH UH VERY IMPORTANT FOR UH THE USER HE HE WANTS TO YEAH
THE THE METHOD WE USED UH IT IT'S NOT M NOT A SLIDE BECAUSE IT WENT WRONG BUT THE METHOD WE USE UH
UM WE TESTED IT W UH WITH UH A HUNDRED UH MEN
AND WE ASKED THEM TO W UH WHAT THE REMOTE UH F FEEL UH LIKE AND UH WHAT WHAT'S UH IMPORTANT
UH
PEOPLE SORRY
BOTH WOMEN AND MEN YEAH
OKAY
UH THE FINDINGS UM UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
UM
YEAH AND YEAH MOST TH TH THEY WANT TO SPEND MONEY FOR A BETTER SYSTEM FOR BETTER REMOTE CONTROL
SO WE CAN DO UH A L A LITTLE UH NICE THINGS WITH IT AND UM THEY USE YEAH
THEY USE ZAP A LOT UM UH FIFTY PERCENT SAY THEY ONLY
SO THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
UM OH YEAH NOT ALL OF IT IS IT ON MINE
ON MY POWERPOINT PRESENTATION BUT UM UH THE RELEVANT BUTTONS ARE THE POWER THE CHANNEL SELECTION AND THE VOLUME SELECTION
IT'S UH THE MOST BASIC BUTTONS THAT A USER WANTS UH TO USE
UH LESS IMPORTANT IS TEL TELETEXT
UH UM THEY USE IT
BUT IT'S NOT UH VERY UH IMPORTANT UH ON THE SCALE OF ZERO TO TEN THEY SIX AND A HALF UH AND BUT NOT IMPORTANT IS THE CHANNEL SELECTION
THE THE HMM
OH THE THE NO NO NO NO NO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT UH W AND NOT IMPORTANT IN THE AUDIO SETTINGS DISPLAY SETTINGS AND UH
YEAH
UM NEW PREFERENCES PREFERENCES
UH UM UM BEEP TO FIND YOUR CONTROL WAS THAT WAS IN THE TEST
THE THE MOST PEOPLE UH F FIND IT UH IRRITATING UH WHEN THEY CANNOT FIND A REM THEIR REMOTE CONTROL
SO UH I THINK IT'S A BEE BEEP TO SOUND IT AND UH YOU CAN FIND IT
AND ANOTHER THING UH THEY WANT WAS UH SPEECH RECOGNITION UM SO THEY CAN SAY UH WHAT THEY WANT TO LET'S GO TO CHANNEL ONE AND UH THAT'S UH KIND OF THINGS
AND THEY WANT MAYBE AN UH L. C. D. SCREEN UM TO TO LOOK IT UM WH WHAT'S ON EVERY CHANNEL UH AND UH WHAT DO I WANT WITH IT
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
UM
UH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES IS UH A BUTTON FOR MY FAVOURITE CHANNEL SO I CAN UH I DUNNO SO I CAN ZAP TO MY UH
F UH QUICK UH TO MY FAVOURITE CHANNEL WH WHAT I UH SO THE REMOTE MU MUST SEE OR UM
MUST UM SEE WHA WHAT MINE PREFERENCES ARE FOR WHICH CHANNEL SO I CAN ZAP T TO
WHAT
YEAH
YEAH
RECOGNISE
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S UH WHAT MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE LIKE
NO ITSELF
MAYBE IT'S EASIER TO TO SELL IT BUT
I DON'T KNOW IT'S MANAGEABLE BUT WE WILL UH WE WILL SEE
YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BIT UH IT'S THE END OF IT
IT'S A LITTLE BIT UH I LOST IT THE COMPUTER UH CRASHED SO
YEAH
DARN COMPUTER
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MM UH
YEAH
UH
YEAH
B
YEAH AND THEY WANT TO PAY FOR IT AND UH
WITH MORE
WHERE WITH MORE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
IN THE
YEAH
YEAH
BUT OH
YEAH WITH WITH AN L. C. D. SCREEN YOU CAN
WHY
NOKIA W
UH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
MM UH
YEAH
UM
EVERYONE UH WANTS TO BUY IT SO WE W YEAH
YEAH
OR ONE
OR WHEN YOU SAY ONE TWO UH I IT UH IT'S ENOUGH RIGHT
BUT
OH YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
BUT B
BUT EVERY
OH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
MM YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
UM YEAH
AND UH WITH DIFFERENT COLOURS UH
OKAY
YEAH
UH
AND A LIGHT UH
VOLUME
UH IT'S IT'S FINE I THINK
OH D
YEAH
JUST
AND L. E. D. UH ON IT
JUST A LIGHT ON IT OR
VERY IMPORTANT
OH THAT'S
IT'S
AND
BUT YOU R
AND YOU ARE READING FROM THE T YOU ALWAYS READ FROM THE TOP TO THE THE BOTTOM OF IT
YEAH SO IT'S
YEAH
SO I IT'S SORRY
NO IT'S NO
UH
HMM
OR OR WITH THE VOLUME SELECTION
AROUND UH NOT UH NOT AT TOP AT THE AROUND THE VOLUME SELECTION
I DON'T KNOW WHERE EXACTLY BUT
WHA
NO
YEAH
YEAH THAT'S BETTER
ON THE RIGHT
YEAH
MAYBE IT'S MORE EX EXPENSIVE
YEAH
HMM
YEAH YEAH
YEAH THAT'S G
BUT
WHICH
YEAH
YEAH
BUT
YEAH THEY WANT TO PAY FOR IT
YEAH
TH UH THERE WAS NOT A EL ASK ESQUE
BUT
BUT F HMM
YEAH
YEAH OKAY
YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
MY COMPUTER CRASHED SO UH
I LOST MY UH PRESENTATION BUT
I HAVE THE UH
YEAH BUT I
HERE I HAVE THE THE S THE HOMEPAGE OF UH OUR
INTERNET AND HERE IS MY
HERE IS MY MARKETING REPORT MAYBE YOU CA YOU CAN LOOK AT UH THAT AND
AH YEAH
AND ONE
AND UH WHA WHAT PEOPLE WANT
I'VE UH
I HAVE ANOTHER THING UH
YEAH
UM
UH WHAT I AL ALREADY SAID IS THE THE UH THE REMOTE CONTROLS ARE ALWAYS LOST
BUT IT IT'S ALSO FOR PEOPLE THEY WANT TO LEARN IT FAST NOT UH THEY WANT TO
NO
IT'S YEAH IT'S EASY TO LEARN WI AND UH
UM
AND
THE
IF
UM
IF UM
ANOTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT UH WE ARE LOOKING AT THE MARKET FOR THE AGE UH YOUNGER THAN FORTY
UM ON MY REPORT I DIDN'T UH ISH I DIDN'T SHOW IT IN MY UH PRESENTATION BECAUSE MY COMPUTER CRASHED
UM THEY WANT TO PAY FOR AN L. C. D. SCREEN AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
SO
I YEAH
YEAH AND
YEAH
UH BUT
IF IF THEY
SO UH
WE CAN
WE CAN LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES FOR AN UH L. C. D. AND UH I DUNNO
YEAH
HOW MUCH IT WILL COST AND
UM
IT WILL COME UH
YEAH
DIFFERENT COLOURS MAYBE
BUT ALL
OKAY
IF YOU'RE READING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM I THINK IT'S BETTER TO PUT IT UH AT THE TOP
IT'S J
UH
BUT I IF YOU IF YOU ARE GOING TO UH PUT THE L. C. D. ON IT
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO USE IT UH BECAUSE IT'S USE IT UH
BUT NEE THE FUNCTION OF IT
SO YOU CAN USE IT MAXIMUM BECAUSE UH IT'S A LOT IT COSTS A LOT
SO
YEAH
IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BUILD IT SO
YOU MUST USE THE MAXIMUM OF IT
HUH
UH
BUT UH
YEAH I KNOW UH
IN MIDDLE OF IT
IN THE MIDDLE
YEAH
IT'S THE MOST IMPORT YEAH
FINISH MEETING NOW
IT'S ON YOUR COMPUTER
UH
OR
AND UH WHAT ABOUT SPEECH RECOGNITION UH
YEAH YEAH BUT OR OR AN L. C. D. OR AN UH SPEECH
I THINK IT'S L. C. D. IS BETTER NOW
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH OKAY YEAH THAT'S YEAH THAT'S OKAY
OH GOOD
YEAH
SAME
HELLO
SO ARE YOU D WHAT WERE J YOU GUYS DISCUSSING
OKAY
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING NEW
MM-HMM
GREAT GREAT
COME ON
WHAT'S UH HERE
AND THERE WE ARE
WHAT THE F OH YEAH UH
IT DOESN'T DO WHAT I WANT IT
OKAY FINE THAT'S TOO BAD
YEAH I HAVE TO START OUR
'KAY
OKAY GO AGAIN
WELL SECOND PHASE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
IT'S FINE EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SO TAKE YOU PAST THE MINUTES OF LAST MEETING AGAIN
AGAIN YOU GET YOUR THREE PRESENTATE TO SEE WHAT YOU CAME UP WITH
SO TOO BAD WE DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCE INFORMATION APPARENTLY
SO THAT'S TOO BAD
SO THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO D UH HAVE TO GO ON YOU KNOW
THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE MAKE FINAL DECISIONS ON UH ON A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
SO
HERE WE GO
ANYWAY LAST W LAST W WHAT DISCUSSED LAST TIME YOU ALL REMEMBER THAT THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP THE ELECTRONICS SIZE IN MIND
SAME GOES FOR YOU
WE HAVE TO HAVE AN EASY DESIGN WITH BIG BUTTONS WHICH ARE DURABLE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY SPEN WILLING TO SPEND MONEY TO DO TO GET MORE FEATURES AND UH AMONG THOSE FEATURES L. C. D. SCREEN AND VOICE RECOGNITION ARE VERY POPULAR
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A MOVE ON THAT AREA I GUESS
S ESPECIALLY S WHEN WHEN THE NEW UH COMPONENT IS APPLICABLE IN OUR UH PRODUCT WE'LL BE FINE
ANYWAYS WELL TELETEXT WASN'T IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT I TOOK
AND THE CONSUMER YEAH WE AIM FOR YOUNG CONSUMERS SO THAT'S FINE
AND WELL ACTUALLY WE YEAH WE DID NEED SOME MORE DATA ON FINANCES BUT W YEAH WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT APPARENTLY
THAT'S TOO BAD
YEAH WE NEED TO IM DE WE ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE BEEP AND THE FLASH THING TO RECOVER YOUR REMOTE
SO ONE OF THESE INTERCHANGEABLE COVERS APPARENTLY WHICH WILL MAKE IT A MORE FASHIONABLE PRODUCT
SO ANYWAY
GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO DO THIS AFTER THE AFTER THE YOU GIVE YOUR PRESENTATIONS
SO I'LL JUST CLOSE THIS ONE NOW AND LET'S UH LET'S SEE
WE HAVE A LOT TO TELL
YOU HAD A LOT TO GO ON
SO UH HOW ABOUT YOU GO FIRST
OKAY
DOES IT PROVIDE ENOUGH ENERGY
ALSO IF IF WE WERE CHOOSE THE THE L. C. D. OPTION WOULD IT GIVE ENOUGH ENERGY OKAY THAT'S THE JUST ASSUME IT TAKES
WELL I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S SHAKEN ENOUGH BECAUSE
NO I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE UH WATCHES CAN GO ON KINETIC ENERGY BECAUSE THEY MOVE ALL THE TIME
BUT I'M SURE T I MEAN REMOTES LIE STILL I THINK LIKE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE WERE SOLAR CELLS
I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPLICABLE BECAUSE
I THIN WHY WHY SHOULDN'T WE TAKE A BASIC BATTERY
WHY NOT
I MEAN EVERYBODY EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO USE THAT
IT'S IT'S COMMON
SO AND IT'S AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE
SO WHY SH MM I THINK BETTER
YEAH BUT IT'S
YEAH UH IT WASN'T IT WASN'T IN THE OPTIONS A RECHARGEABLE M MODULE ACTUALLY
OKAY YEAH B YOU C OF COURSE YOU COULD PLACE RE RE CHARGEABLE BATTERIES
BUT THAT'S UP TO THE CONSUMER HIMSELF
SO
WELL MM IT'S NOT IN THE LIST
SO WE CANNOT CHOOSE FROM IT
SO
OKAY WILL JUST TAKE REGULAR BATTERIES
OKAY WE'LL GET BACK ON THAT LATER
JUST
BUT WHAT WERE THE IMPLICATIONS IF YOU IF PUT MORE CURVES IT IT'S GETS MORE EXPENSIVE
OKAY SO I THINK WITH WITH THE EXTRAS THAT WE HAD THERE IT'S TWO CURVES I SUPPOSE
OKAY
ALSO DECREASES OKAY
OKAY
MORE THAN ONE CURVE UH YEAH OKAY
WE'LL JUST GO UH
'CAUSE IT YEAH I'M NOT SURE
WE'LL DISCUSS THAT LATER
OKAY WE HAVE SO I THINK WE CAN RULE OUT UM I'M NOT SURE WE CAN RULE ANYTHING OUT
WE'LL DO THAT WHEN Y WHEN YOU GET YOUR DESIGN
NO WOOD I WOOD'S NOT AN OPTION
WELL IT IT'S STYLISH BUT WE CAN YEAH BUT YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR COVERS ANYWAY
YEAH IS IT KEEP IN MIND THAT IT IT'S IT'S UH IT FAL UH REMOTE CONTROLS FALL A LOT ON THE GROUND
SO YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BREAK
SO EITHER HAVE RUBBER EDGES OR A RUBBER REMOTE CONTROL IS VERY DURABLE
BUT CONTINUE
DON'T HAVE TO BE UN BREAKABLE IT'S P IT'S A IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO JU YEAH BREAK AFTER ONE USE
I MEAN IT THEY THEY FALL A LOT
SO
WELL YOU HAVE FOR IF YOU IF FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU TAKE HARD PLASTIC
IF IT FALLS IT MIGHT CRACK
AND RUBBER UH KIND OF SOFTENS THE FALL
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE IT'S THE ENTIRE COVER YOU CHANGE
UH IT'S COULD BE
YOU KNOW WHAT TH WE'RE FOCUSING VERY MUCH ON THE COVERS NOW
I THINK IT'S JUST W NOW WE'RE GOING FOR THE BASIC DESIGN
IF WE WANNA EXPAND OUR OPTIONS F BE FASHIONABLE THEN WE CAN GET CHANGEABLE COVERS
BUT I THINK THE BASIC THING LET'S JUST RULE OUT WOOD FOR NOW AND CONTINUE
WE'RE DEFINITELY FOCUSSING ON THE YOUNGER PEOPLE 'CAUSE THAT WAS OUR MAIN GOAL
OKAY OKAY WE WILL
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
EVIDENT
YEAH O OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA USE
BUT I DIDN'T I DIDN'T GO ON THE THOUGHT OF A SCROLL WHEEL ACTUALLY
I'M STILL DECIDING ON WHAT WHAT WHAT COULD YOU USE IT FOR
MAYBE FOR VOLUME CONTROL
CHANNEL I THINK THAT WOULD BE ANNOYING BECAUSE IT MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY SCROLL ONTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
I THINK A PUSH BUTTON FOR CHANNEL WOULD BE BETTER
I MEAN IT FOR VOLUME CONTROL IT'S IT'S A SMOOTHER MOTION YOU CAN JUST INCREASE OR DECREASE
BUT NOT SURE
FOR CHANNELS WILL BE GOOD
I DON'T THINK SO
I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T TAKEN IT INTO CONSIDERATION
I DON'T THINK WE REALLY NEED ONE
BUT WHY DO WE NEED IT
IF WE DON'T NEED IT
WHY PUT IT IN YOUR WHY PUT IT IN YOUR IN YOUR IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR OR IS USEFUL
ARE THEY
YEAH BUT IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT USEFUL I DON'T THINK IT I DON'T THINK IT GIVES AN EXTRA FUNCTION TO THE REMOTE
ANYWAY
WHAT YOU WHAT WHAT'D YOU GET ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN
IS IT EXPENSIVE
DOES IT
AND HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IS THAT
OR
NO ABSOLUTE NUMBERS BUT IT'S JUST MORE EXPENSIVE AND TAKES MORE ROOM I SUPPOSE IN YOUR IN YOUR DESIGN
DON'T THINK IT'S AN ISSUE OKAY
OH LET'S GO FOR LET'S SAY BECAUSE IT IS UH VERY HOT IN N OUR TARGET GROUP I THINK
WE SHOULD TAKE IT TAKE IT T TO CONSIDERATION TO BUILD AN L. C. D. SCREEN IN IT
OKAY
WHICH BASICALLY HAS THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY BUT LACKS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
OKAY
WE'LL PICK A WE'LL PICK FROM UH WE'LL JUST COMBINE EVERYTHING LATER
MM-HMM
ONCE AGAIN I WAS WOULD ASK YOU IF IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT APPARENTLY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DATA
SO
WELL WHAT D WHAT WAS EXACT WHAT YOU GOT ON THE ON THE NEW COMPONENT
THAT'S SMALL
SO WE CAN IMPLEMENT IT
SO WHY WHY IF IT'S SMALL AND WE CAN IMP WHY SHOULDN'T WE
AND THERE'S UM GET YOUR MAR MARKETING REPORT
WHAT WAS UH THE LAST NUMBER OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN VOICE RECOGNITION
ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD FOR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF COURSE
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROGRAMME IT YOURSELF I SUPPOSE WITH YOUR OWN VOICE
MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION
IF IT'S SMALL IF IT'S FITS IF IF PEOPLE LIKE IT WHY NOT
SO
YEAH BUT WE GOT SOME DATA ON PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY ARE INT ARE INTERESTED IN THAT AND I DON'T THINK A SCROLL WHEEL OFFERS NEW FUNCTIONALITY
WHEREAS SPEECH RECOGNITION AND L. C. D. SCREEN DO OFFER NEW FUNCTIONALITY IN YOUR PRODUCT
UH I THINK SO BECAUSE IF I THINK WE'RE SPECIALLY W IF YOU'RE GOING MAYBE UH IF YOU HAVE THE TWO EDITIONS YOU WANNA WANNA GIVE OUT
PROBABLY YOU HAVE ONE WITH UH WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION AND
UM
YEAH HOLD ON A MINUTE
WERE WERE YOU WE'RE FINISHED
OR
OH
BECAUSE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
'CAUSE HAVE DID YOU HAVE ALL THE MATERIALS
OR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DESC
OKAY SO UH JUST JUST GO FOR DESIGN FOR NOW
JUST M HAVE A SEAT FOR A SECOND
UH
WE'LL COMBINE EVERYTHING AFTER THIS
WHY IS IT S WHY IS IT SQUARED
WHY DID YOU PICK SQUARE
OR UH NOT SQUARE BUT WHY IS IT YEAH SHARP CORNERS
LOOKS LIKE A STAR TREK PHASER
IT'S TRUE
YEAH
OR OKAY SO JUST YEAH YOU CAN REST IT ON YOUR FINGER
OKAY
MM-HMM
NO IT JUST UH IT'S A CURVE INSIDE A THING
SO
IT'S ON THE BACK
YEAH I THINK IT'S OKAY
KEYS ARE PROBABLY THE N THE NUMBER KEYS I SUPPOSE
OKAY
WELL YOU CAN WORK ON THE ACTUAL CONCEPT OR ACTUAL DESIGN LATER WITH HIM
BUT
WELL I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT UM YOU'RE MOVING THE THE THE NUMBER KEYS FROM THE TOP
UH IN THE THE SIMPLE DESIGN YOU HAVE THEM AT A TOP AND THE UH COMPLEX DESIGN YOU HAVE THEM AT THE BOTTOM
SO IT WOULD THAT WOULD GIVE US A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESIGN
SO WHICH ACTUALLY MAKING A WHOLE DIFFERENT PRODUCT INSTEAD OF TWO DIFFERENT MODELS
I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE TWO WHOLE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS
SO
YEAH UH OR FOR EXAMPLE WHY DID YOU PICK THE MM THE NUMBERS UH ALL THE WAY BELOW AND THE AND THE CHANNELS AND VOLUME CONTROL
OKAY
THAT'S FINE
THAT'S FINE
JUST AS LONG AS YOU TAK TOOK IT INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PREFER
UH OKAY IF YOU ALL AGREE I'M FINE WITH IT
BUT
OKAY
YEAH I THINK WE'LL
I THINK WE'RE GOING TOWARDS THE DELUXE EDITION ANYWAY BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT
BUT LET'S SEE WHAT'S WHAT THEY WANT NOW
MM-HMM
THAT'S MINE
NO YOU SHOULD SEND IT TO THE F TO THE FOLDER FIRST
OKAY UM LET'S JUST ASSUME WE GO TO FORTY ONE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
I THINK SO
OKAY
OKAY SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING FOR RUBBER
LET'S JUST GO
UH-HUH
NAH I THINK WE'RE IN THIS CASE YOU'RE LOSING THE THE FOCUS ON THE YOUNG GROUP BECAUSE WE'RE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSSING ON
SO I THINK THE SPONGY FEEL GIVES US RUBBER
YEAH W TH APPARENTLY
YEAH APPARENTLY YEAH MAYBE ALSO YEAH I TEND TO DISAGREE WITH WITH UH WITH A SHARP FORM
I SUPPOSE IT BASI IF YOU'RE UH SAYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES MAYBE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A LITTLE LITTLE MORE ROUND
YEAH FOR EXA MAYBE LIKE UH LIKE A PEAR OR SOMETHING
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING
MM
I THINK SHAPE IS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY S THEY REALLY EXTEND
YEAH BUT NOW YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR LIKE YOUR STAR TREK PHASER THING SHAPED CONTROL
SO I I TH THE EDGES ARE REALLY REALLY SHARP
I'M UH NOT SU
OR MAYBE JUST MAKE IT MAKE IT UP INTO INTO A LOW A SMOOTH CURVE INSTEAD OF JUST LESS SHARP TWIST ON THE OUTSIDE
I THINK I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE I THINK IT'S TOO TOO SHARP
THE EDGES ARE TOO SHARP
THE BOTTOM IS FINE OF COURSE IF IT'S SQUARE
BUT MAYBE JUST TH MAKE UH THE TOP A LITTLE ROUND IT OFF ON THE SIDES
SO I MEAN Y
THAT WOULD BE TWO CURVES
ONE CUR YOU COULD ALSO MAKE THE CURVE GO THROUGH OF COURSE
BUT THAT WOULD MAKE MAKE THE TOP ROUND
BUT LET'S SEE TITANIUM WOULD GIVE US ONLY ONE CURVE
SO BUT WE'RE NOT D WE'RE NOT USING TITANIUM
RIGHT WE DID
SO
JUST DOODLE SOMETHING ON THE BOARD ON THE LEFT
WELL ACTUALLY WE'RE SETTING OURSELVES APART FROM BY TECHNOLOGY ALONE ACTUALLY
SO THAT LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
OH OKAY
I DON'T THINK LIKE THAT
NOT NOT REALLY THE CURVES ON THE ON THE SIDE OF THE REMOTE
OKAY NOW I UH OF COURSE NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE MORE UH LIKE UM
WHY THE CURVES
UM DECREASE THE THE UM THE SIZE THE ELECTRONICS THAT CAN BE INSIDE
SO OKAY
I DON'T THINK THE OUTSIDE WOULD BE CALLED AS A CURVE REALLY
I THINK IT'S FOR ALL THE BASIC WELL LOOKING FROM THE SIDE ANYWAY
WELL IF YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME DESIGNS FAST ANYWAY
SO
OKAY
WELL YOU SHOULDN'T FOCUS ON THE MOSTLY ON THE COVERS BECAUSE LOT OF THINGS WE CAME UP WITH
SHOULDN'T BE TOO REALLY TOO MUCH SHOULDN'T BE TOO FOCUSSED ON THE COVERS BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF AN IDEA OF OUR OWN
BUT WE'RE NOT SURE IF WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THAT
THAT'S THE ONE THING I'M ALSO AFRAID OF WITH THIS ONE BECAUSE IT THE EDGES ARE REALLY UM THEY MIGHT STICK OUT ON THE ON THE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE
IF YOU HAVE A BASIC DESIGN A LITTLE M A LITTLE SMALLER ON THE ON THE S ON THE EDGES
YOU COULD PUT MORE COVERS ON IT Y ONE ONE WITH SQUARE OR UM SHARP CORNERS IF YOU WANT TO
SO M JUST ROUND IT OFF A LITTLE I GUESS BECAUSE SO WE HAVE MORE OPTIONS I SUPPOSE
I THINK SO BECAUSE IT LOOKS LEANER AND WE SHOULD JUST GO WITH THAT
ANYWAY YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO MAKE TO MAKE THE FINAL DESIGN IN A MINUTE WITH HIM
SO SO WE DECIDED ON WHAT WHAT DID YOU GUYS WANNA KNOW AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS UM ANYWAY I'LL FIRE UP MY THING
SO SO WE COME TO A DECISION
UH WHAT THE
AH
YEAH
OKAY ANYWAY
UH ENERGY WE CHOOSE REGULAR REGULAR BATTERIES
THE CHIP IS ADVANCED BECAUSE WE HAVE THE ADVANCED FEATURES
THE CASE IT WILL BE THE MATERIAL WILL BE RUBBER SUPPOSE
WOULDN'T THE B THE DESIGN WE TALKED ABOUT
UH USER INTERFACE TYPE
WELL I THINK WE TOOK ALL THE COMPONENTS SEPARATELY WHAT WE WANT
UM LET'S SEE UM SUPPLEMENTS
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT
ANYWAY UM APPARENTLY YOU GUYS YOU SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THE FINAL DESIGN BOTH ON INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DESIGN
SO
YEAH YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD PROBABLY FIND OUT HOW THE PRODUCT WILL FALL INTO THE MARKET
HOW UH WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH THE FINAL DESIGN AS WE HAVE IT NOW
SO YEAH OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT YOUR SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION AS USUAL
SO WANNA SPEND SOME MORE UM I THINK WE'RE IN A PRETTY MUCH IN AGREEMENT ACTUALLY WHICH IS GOOD
SO
LEF LET'S SEE WHERE THE PEN GO
HERE
YEAH UH OPEN YOUR THING AGAIN
LET'S SEE WHAT IF YOU CAN COME UP WITH ANYTHING NEW
UM I'LL JUST DO A NEXT ONE
SO WHAT WOULD GIVE US YOUR NE YOUR DESIGN WOULD BE THE LIGHTS WOULD BE ON TOP RIGHT
UH ONE ON EACH ONE ON EACH SIDE
IS IT IS IT THE LIGHTS FOR FOR FINDING THE FINDING REMOTE OR LIGHTS THAT IT THAT
YEAH I THINK THAT SHOULD JUST BE A SIMPLE LED OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT OF COURSE
IT JUST LIKE A MATTER OF A A BEEP IF YOU PRE THAT YOU JUST KNOW THAT THAT THERE'S CONTEXT
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUPER IMPORTANT
BUT
HMM
UH SH OH
LET'S SEE I'LL JUST MAKE
ONE LIGHT HERE
AND JUST MAKE IT RED NOW
BUT IT COULD BE ANY COLOUR
SO
OKAY WHATEVER
FINE ANYWAY
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE
M I'LL MAKE IT UM ARE WE GONNA USE SQUARE BUTTONS OR ROUND ONES ACTUALLY
PERSONALLY I WOULD PREFER ROUND ONES
YEAH FOR
OKAY
OKAY I ASSUME IT FOR SO WE TAKE A R TAKE A ROUND POWER BUTTON RIGHT HERE
WHATEVER
UH BACK TO BLACK
UH NOT TOO BIG THOUGH
SEE THIS WOULD BE GOOD
UM LET'S SEE
ARE THESE FOR ANY EXTRA CONTROLS
OKAY
OKAY
IF WE GO FOR FOR ROUND BUTTONS IN GENERAL DO WE WANT TO THE MENU KEY IN THE MIDDLE TO BE ROUND
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LET'S SEE PUT IT THIS HERE
I THINK WE'LL GO WITH THE TRIANGLES THAT COME ON
TRIANGLES ARE GOOD
YEAH THEY'RE A LITTLE TOO BIG NOW
BUT
ANYWAY OKAY
SO DO YOU WANT FOR EXAMPLE A
ROUND BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE OR SQUARE ONE
I'M NOT SURE UH I JUST JUST CAME UP WITH IT
THIS ALIGNS NICELY
SO
OKAY
WE'LL JUST TAKE THE TAKE THE ROUND BUTTON SUPPOSE
UH OH THE SQUARE BUTTON SORRY
I SUPPOSE SO
OKAY
SO THERE'S OUR NUMBERS
THINK WE NEED AN EXTRA BUTTON HERE OF COURSE FOR YEAH LIKE YOU HAD FOR THE
HIGHER NUMBERS
AND YOU COULD INCLUDE A BUTTON HERE FOR THE MUTE I SUPPOSE
FOR SOMETHING ELSE JUST TO
MIRROR MIRROR THE EFFECT WITH THIS
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE IT YOU CAN TAKE THIS AWAY BUT THERE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A HOLE THERE JUST TO MIRROR THE EFFECT
OKAY SO WE HAVE A FEW
NAH I THINK IT IT WOULD BE NICE TO PUT THE LOGO HERE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE SOME BUTTONS HERE
WE COULD PUT A LOGO HERE BECAUSE IT'S VERY ALWAYS IN YOUR FIELD OF VISION
IF YOU'RE WATCHING IT THE L. C. D. SCREEN BLAH BLAH
WELL WE COULD WE COULD INCLUDE EITHER HERE
OR HERE FOR EXAMPLE
BUT YOU THINK HERE OR HERE
I KNOW
NO WE COULD PUT THIS ONE AS FAVOURITE CHANNEL FOR EXAM
WHAT ARE THESE FOR
OKAY
WHAT
YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO ELEVEN
MY UH OKAY HAVE IT YOUR WAY
I MEAN THINK THIS LOOKS RATHER LIKE LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING FOR EXAMPLE
I MEAN WHY WOULDN'T YOU INCLUDE A 'CAUSE THERE IS A UM A PIECE OF ELECTRONICS UNDER THERE ANYWAY
SO WHY NOT GIVE IT A FUNCTION
LET'S SAY I MEAN COULD BE ANYTHING
BUT TH
NO I DON'T THINK BECAUSE THIS IS A ZERO
BUT YOU WANT ZERO TO BE MIS ALIGNED WITH THE REST
ANYWAY SO THIS IS THE BASIC DESIGN WE WANNA HAVE UM ON AND OFF WHAT ARE WE MISSING
IF IT LOOKS UM
OKAY SO WE WANT THE REMOTE TO BE THE S THE SIDE VIEW ACTUALLY WHAT I'M GONNA DRAW
SO
UM
PROBABLY THINK YOU WANT THE CURVE TO BE HERE
SO HAVE YOUR FINGER UNDER HERE LIKE THIS I SUPPOSE
OKAY
JUST GONNA BE SH
YEAH
WANT THIS STRAIGHT OR WHAT
LET'S KEEP IT AT THIS
SO IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS
DO WE WANT SOMETHING INTERESTING WITH IT OR SEE
WOULD GIVE US A LIGHT HERE
MAYBE IT'S BORING
YOU WANT IT CURVED OR WHAT
MAYBE YOU WANT
SHOULD LIKE THIS
WILL GIVE US DESIGN PROBLEM BECAUSE WE HAVE
IT CAN BE CURVED
OKAY
I THINK SO
THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU
OKAY
SO
OH CRAP
YEAH
OH
ANYWAY SO YOU WANT TO A LITTLE MORE LIKE THIS
AND JUST S S
STOP THE CURVE HERE OR CONTINUE IT
SO WE HAVE OUR L. C. D. SCREEN
LET'S SEE
IN
BANA IT'S BANANA VISION
SO YOU HAVE YOUR L. C. D. SCREEN RIGHT HERE SUPPOSE
UM THAT WOULD MAKE
WE USE THE COLOURS NOW
BUT
UM
YOU GOT SPONSOR NOW YOU GET A FREE ONE WITH EVERY PACK OF CHIQUITA
SO IT WOULD GIVE THE BUTTONS HERE
I SUPPOSE I SUPPOSE WE CAN PUT UM LET'S SEE
UM
UH I SUPPOSE WE CAN PUT THE BATTERIES IN HERE BECAUSE IT HAS THE MOST SPACE FOR EXAMPLE
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST PART OF THE UH OF THE UH
LET'S
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
I THINK IT'S THE BEST PLACE YEAH YOU COULD ALSO PUT 'EM HERE
BUT
OKAY SO WE PUT THE BATTERIES HERE
THAT'S FINE
YEP
BLAH
UM ANY OTHER COM WHAT WHAT ARE WE MISSING HERE
SOMETHING A SPEECH RECOGNITION
UM
WHERE DO WE WANT THE MICROPHONE FOR EXAMPLE TO BE
ON THE SIDE OR ON THE OR FOR EXAMPLE ON TOP
LIKE HERE
TO BE
OKAY I W THOUGHT MAYBE IT'S EITHER BE HERE OR BECAUSE IT'S MI IT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH THE TRANSMITTER I'M NOT SURE
BUT
'CAUSE TRANSMITTER WOULD BE HERE
WHY UH ONCE AGAIN LIKE YOU SAID THE COMPONENT CAN BE SOMEWHERE AT THE BOTTOM WHILE WE WIRE THE MICROPHONE UP THERE
ANYWAY
UM YEAH IT COULD BE EITHER BE HERE OR MAKE A DOUBLE MICROPHONE
I WOULDN'T MIND
IT'S ABLE TO TALK TO YOU
A SPEAKER SENSOR
I THINK SO IT I THINK IT COULD
YEAH
I MEAN IT COULD BE A ALL THIS STUFF COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE L. C. D. SCREEN WHICH YOU COULD NAVIGATE WITH THIS I SUPPOSE
NAVIGATE THROUGH EVERYTHING
IF YOU HAVE I THINK YOU SH I THINK THE ADVANCED OPTIONS SHOULD BE I THINK IT SH THE ADVANCED OPTION COULD ALSO BE INTEGRATED IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN
OF COURSE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A BUTTON FOR EVERYTHING
YOU CAN JUST NAVIGATE THROUGH TH M YOUR MENU THAT YOU HAVE HERE FOR ADVANCED OPTIONS WITH THIS
THINK THAT WOULD BE FINE
SO THAT'S W M WOULD BE MAKING USE OF THE L. C. D. SCREEN
MM
BEEP
UM SO THE FLASHING OF THE BEEP WE HAVE WELL ANYTHING
WE COULD YEAH BUT YOU COULD PUT A SPEAKER OR SOMETHING ON ON THE SIDE FOR EXAMPLE
FOR HOW DO YOU DRAW THAT AGAIN
UH WHATEVER LOOKS STUPID
I THINK THIS IS PRETTY
I THINK YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE BECAUSE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO FIVE MINUTES TO FINISH THE MEETING
OH
LIKE MY THE INFO THAT I GOT WAS THAT YOU'RE UH WE'RE GONNA WORK ON OUR OWN BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA DO THE MARKET MARKET UH ANALYSING I'M SUPPOSED TO DO THE LITTLE WORK ON THE YEAR END REPORT
SO THE PROJECT REPORT
HMM
OKAY I THINK WE'RE EVERYBODY SATISFIED WITH THE WITH THE CURRENT DESIGN WE HAVE
SO WE'RE S SUPPOSED TO BE RUBBER
I THINK WELL I THINK THE THE REMOTE CONTROL IS GONNA BE BLACK BECAUSE WE WE FORGOT TO TALK ABOUT I MEAN THE THE COMPANY COLOURS ARE IMPORTANT APPARENTLY
SO WE HAVE THE LOGO UP THERE
SO ARE WE GONNA BASE COLOUR IS BLACK
AND YEAH OF COURSE WE COULD USE YELLOW BUTTONS OR YELLOW NAVIGATION OR WHATEVER
YELLOW BUT YELLOW CONTROL
IT'S
OKAY
WELL DON'T DON'T STICK YOURSELF ON THE COVERS RIGHT NOW
BUT DON'T STICK YOURSELF ON THE COVER BECAUSE
NAH
YEAH BUT THE INFO
I THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH UH WITH THE COMPANY COLOUR BECAUSE WHAT SPECIFIC INFO THAT I GOT FROM THE PROJECT BOARD
SO I THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH THAT
THEY WANT SOMETHING TRENDY
I THINK WE SHOULD TH THEN TAKE IT TAKE YELLOW
TAKE WHAT YOU C YELLOW REMOTE CONTROL
SO LET'S SEE IF IF WE CAN DO THE LED ONTO IT
UH OH
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS
THAT'S UP TO YOU GUYS
YOU DOODLE A DOODLE US A NICE NICE DESIGN FOR FOR THE NEXT MEETING WE'LL BE DONE
I THINK WE'RE ALL HAPPY NOW
YEAH
STUPID SCROLL WHEEL
'KAY
I'M NOT SURE UH I REALLY I'M NO I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT WE COULD USE THE SCROLL WHEEL FOR
IT TAKES SPACE A LOT OF SPACE
AND IT COULD
I'M NOT SURE IF IT IF IT HAS NO FUNCTION WHY EVEN PUT IT THERE
AND TH THAT'S JUST SO MUCH THINGS THAT MAKE IT LOOK FLASH
I THINK CHANNEL SELECTION WOULD BE ANNOYING BECAUSE IT JUST C YOU COULD SCROLL PAST THE CHANNEL OR
HMM
NO R NO SCROLL WHEEL
OKAY
UM I DON'T SEE ANYTHING MISSING REALLY
YEAH WE SHOULD TOO BAD WE DON'T HAVE THE FINANCE
WE COULD'VE
YEAH
IT'S I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE GONNA GET FINANCE ANYWAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE COU I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE AN ISSUE AT THE FIRST TIME WE STARTED
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A COST ISSUE WHICH MATERIAL WE WERE GONNA TAKE RELATIVE TO THE ADVANCED CHIPS OR ANYTHING
SO YOU JUST DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE AND UH DOESN'T CARE WHAT IT COSTS
I THINK WE'RE RUBBER IS NOT EXPENSIVE
DEFINITELY
YOU CAN MAKE RUBBER IN ANY COLOUR
IN ANY COLOUR
SO I MEAN YOU CAN'T MAKE YELLOW TITANIUM BUT YOU CAN MAKE YELLOW RUBBER
UH YEAH WE CAN MAKE UH FOR EXAMPLE IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU CAN CLICK ON IT LIKE UH THAT'S BUT IT'S NOT SOM NOT APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING WITH IN THE BASIC DESIGN
SO
YEAH IT COULD BE
IT CAN BE DONE FOR E
WELL I HAD JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SO I HOPE IT'S SOMETHING UH WE CAN WORK WITH
BUT
HMM
WELL I HEARD THAT THERE WAS A NEW UH COMPONENT SPEECH RECOGNITION COMPONENT
WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH UP TO STANDARD SO WE MIGHT USE THAT I PUT THAT IN MY DRAWING BUT AGAIN I DIDN'T NOT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME
SO
OKAY THAT'S JUST SUPER
LET ME JUST
UH
YOU NEED TO START IT UP FIRST
OKAY
OKAY WHAT T
OKAY YEAH
IS THAT ENOUGH
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY SEE PEOPLE SHAKING THEIR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE USING IT
NO
AND WHAT DOES THE HAND DYNAMO OH SORRY
OH
CURVES BEING
OF THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF OKAY
I WAS THINKING ALONG THE LINE OF ONE CURVE
I'LL SHOW THAT IN MY DESIGN
SO WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT
OKAY I T I'D GO FOR PLASTIC BECAUSE I HAVE A COUPLE OF CURVES IN MY DESIGN
WELL G LET'S JUST GET BACK TO THAT
NO WOOD'S NOT AN OPTION
NO
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE UNBREAKABLE BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO KEEP SELLING THESE THING
OKAY WELL THAT THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE
BECAUSE IT WELL RU WILL RUBBER ACTUALLY PROTECT THE REMOTE CONTROL ITSELF
BECAUSE IT
YEAH BUT THEN YOU BUY A NEW COVER
BUT RUBBER
OKAY
YEAH OF COUR
YEAH BUT THERE IS A IS IT REALLY NECESSARY 'CAUSE A NORMAL PUSH BUTTON CAN DO THAT JOB
YEAH BUT WHY WOULD WE USE IT
PERHAPS
I HAVE T I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
OKAY
I HAVE TWO DESIGNS ONE INCLUDING UH AN L. C. D. SCREEN WH WHICH IS BASICALLY THE DELUXE EDITION
AND THEN I ALSO HAVE A STANDARD EDITION WHICH WI WE CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO DEVELOP TOO
EXACTLY
BUT WE'LL
YEP
BASICALLY IT
OH I GOT
I GOT AN EMAIL THAT IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL
YES LET ME JUST
GET BACK
WELL THEY B THEY BASICALLY CAN HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION
I MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE L. C. D. UH ASPECT
'CAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE THEM RIGHT
SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE DELUXE EDITION
I J
WHY IS IT SQUARE
IT 'CAUSE IT'S DESIGNY
IT'S BASICALLY IT HAS SOME FUTURISTIC
POTENTIALLY YEAH
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
BUT I JUST THOUGHT THAT UH IN NORMAL REMOTE CONTROLS YOU HAVE LIKE SMOOTH CURVES AND THIS AND THAT
AND THIS IS SOMETHING NEW THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOMETHING FRESH
AND BASICALLY WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT IT HAS A LITTLE YEAH LET'S SAY GAP WHICH YOU CAN PUT YOUR FINGER IN
SO YOU CAN YOU CAN HOLD IT REALLY COMFORTABLE THAT'S BASICALLY THE IDEA
OR LEFT HAND
I DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE REMOTE CONTROL
UH YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT THAT WELL BUT THIS IS THE L. C. D. SCREEN
SO JUST IMAGINE IT GOES THAT WAY
THEN YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN HOLD IT IN YOUR LEFT OR IN YOUR RIGHT HAND
AND I ALSO MADE A QUICK IMAGE 'CAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME
OF THE STANDARD EDITION
WHICH HAS BASICALLY THE KEYS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
YEAH
I HAD TO DO THIS REALLY FAST
SO EXCUSE ME FOR THE UH INCONVENIENCE HERE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THE KEYS MOVED
YEAH
SO THESE ARE BASICALLY THE TWO TYPES WE HAVE
SO IF WE WERE TO SELECT THE L. C. D. SCREEN THE TRANSMITTER HERE YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT I
WELL WE CAN SHIFT THAT
BUT NORMALLY AS YOU CAN SEE THERE WE PUT THE UH NUMBER BUTTONS RIGHT ON TOP
WHEREAS BECAUSE WE HAD THE L. C. D. SCREEN HERE WE HAD TO MOVE THEM DOWNWARD SO WHAT YOU COULD SAY IS THAT
BECAUSE THESE ARE BASICALLY THE FUNCTIONS YOU USE THE MOST
SO IF YOU HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND LIKE THIS YOU PUT YOUR FINGER IN THE GAP THIS IS THE M MOST EASY PART
BIT
FOR ZAPPING CAU BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ZAPPING MOST OF THE TIME
OKAY
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HA WHICH I HAD IN MIND
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THIS CAN BE SPACED FOR EXTRA KEYS WHICH IS THE DESIGN THINGYS
YEAH
SPEECH RECOGNITION
THEN RUBBER WOULD BE THE BEST AS A MATERIAL INDEED
IF THAT IS THE UH
IT COULD BE A C IT COULD BE A COVER
BUT IT'S NOT
OUR FOCUS IS THE YOUNG AUDIENCE
SO LET'S STICK TO THAT
YEAH BUT THAT'S JUST MORE A SE A SEASONAL A TREND THING
THE IDEA NOW IS IS IS THAT YOU CAN UH PUT A COVER ON IT FOR EXAMPLE WITH FRUIT LIKE A SHAPE OR WHATEVER
BUT NOT 'CAUSE A N NEXT YEAR IT WILL IT'LL BE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR APPLE SHAPED REMOTE CONTROL WHICH IS NOT TRENDY ANYMORE
SO I THINK THAT'S MORE SOMETHING YOU CAN FOCUS
WELL YOU CAN S
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS SMOOTH THE EDGES INDEED
BUT THAT WILL BRING EXTRA C EXPENSES
WELL WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT LIKE ONE CURVE HERE
FOR THE GAP
AND WE COULD HAVE ONE HERE
NO NO NO NO NO
WHAT I'M JUST 'CAUSE YOU MENTIONED THAT MORE CURVES THE MORE EXPENSIVE SO I'M JUST TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT
WELL WE PICKED RUBBER RIGHT
SO BASICALLY WHAT WE CAN DO IS M MAKE THESE EDGES A LITTLE BIT LESS SHARP
BUT THE PROBLEM THEN IS THAT IT WILL START TO RESEMBLE M THE REMOTE CONTROLS AS WE HAVE THEM TODAY
WE WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING FRESH SOMETHING TRENDY
OKAY
OKAY SO THAT'S BASICALLY SILLY
BUT ISN'T THE F THE FRUIT LIKE A COVER THING BECAUSE WE
NO BUT
BUT IF WE PUT THAT DIRECTLY INTO THE DESIGN WE LIMIT OURSELVES EXTREMELY
BECAUSE IT THAT'S JUST FOR ONE SEASONAL TREND
OKAY SO THAT'S WELL THAT'S PROBABL
YOU'D JUST LIKE IT TO GO A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE THIS
OKAY
DID YOU PRESENT E EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO
OKAY
UH WE STILL NEED TO DECIDE ON A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU YOU NEEDED TO KNOW
ARE WE ALL IN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE WELL THE PRIMARY STRUCTURE OF THE OF MY DESIGN
EXCEPT FOR THE EDGES
LIKE THE KEYS THERE
YEAH
TO CREATE A KIND OF DISCO EFFECT WHEN YOU
THAT WAS BASICALLY WHAT W
LIGHT FOR THE FINDING OF THE REMOTE
WE CAN ALSO USE ONE LIGHT FOR
SHOWING THAT THE SIGNAL IS BEING SENT
BUT
SO WE HAVE THE TELETEXT WE HAVE HERE WE HAVE THE MUTE
L. C. D. SCREEN
THIS IS THE ON OFF BUTTON
SPEECH RECOGNITION I WHERE DID I IMAGINE
I DID THAT PRETTY MUCH OVER HERE SO THAT YOU COULD USE IT LIKE THIS
AND SPEAK TO IT
THEN YOU HAVE THE UH EXTRA KEYS FOR TELETEXT MUTE TWO BUTTONS WHICH CAN BE PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING OR NOTHING
WE CAN ALSO JUST NOT USE THEM
MAIN CONTROLS AND A KEY PAD
WILL BE FINE
YEAH BUT THAT WOULD THIS WAS JUST IN THE DESIGN
BECAUSE IF YOU I HAD A SQUARE DESIGN
SO I HAD SQUARE BUTTONS
BUT IN THAT CASE THE ROUND BUTTONS WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE
YEAH
THE LEFT ONE IS TELETEXT AND THE RIGHT ONE IS MUTE
AND THESE TWO BUTTONS ARE OR NOT NECESSARY OR
YEAH THE TRIANGLES WOULD BE BEST INDEED
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT A ROUND B BUTTON LOOKS BIT SILLY BUT
DOES EVERYBODY AGREE ON THAT
YOU PREFER A ROUND
OKAY
YEAH YOU CAN
BUT IT BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY BECAU
WE COULD PUT OUR LOGO THERE
OH THAT COULD BE THAT B
WELL NOW IT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT TOO CROWDED UP THERE
SO IS YOUR
SO IT CAN BASICALLY BE THE BUTTON DOWN BELOW OR ONE OF THE FOUR BUTTONS UP THERE
BECAUSE
ONE OF THE FOUR IS BETTER I SUPPOSE
BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING TO HAVE TWELVE BUTTONS DOWN THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY ACCUSTOMED TO ELEVEN I'D SAY
OH WE STILL NEED AN OKAY BUTTON
WELL YOU COULD ALSO SHIFT THE TWO BUTTONS TO BE NICELY ALIGNED
OH WE'RE PRETTY MUCH MISSING AN OKAY BUTTON BUT WE HAVE A BUTTON UP THERE WHICH IS STILL FREE
SO
YEAH PRETTY MUCH
WELL I THINK IT LOOKS BETTER CURVED
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY UH
IT CAN BE CURVED BECAUSE THAT YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE TRENDY TO BE CURVED
HMM
BUT IT PRETTY MUCH LOOKS LIKE A BANANA ALREADY
UH
IT'S FRUIT
YEAH
OR THEY CAN DESIGN THEIR OWN COVER
WE COULD SET UP A A MARKETING UH AGREEMENT
WON'T THAT BE A PROBLEM WITH THE L. C. D. SCREEN
YEAH BUT THE L. C. D. SCREEN PROBABLY NEEDS QUITE THE CHIP
OKAY
OKAY THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
OKAY
I THINK WE GET THE IDEA
OH BASICALLY THE IDEA THAT I HAD WAS IT TO BE PRETTY MUCH IN COMBINATION WITH THE TRANSMITTER
'CAUSE YOU CAN TALK TO IT LIKE THIS
WELL THE EMAIL SAID IT WAS A QUITE A SMALL COMPONENT
SO I DON'T SEE THAT
IT'S A
WELL THE
YEAH BUT DO YOU ACTUALLY NEED THE REMOTE TALKING BACK
BEEP
AT THE BACK YEAH
LIKE THAT
OR AT THE SIDE
WHICH IS
SO WHAT'S BASICALLY EDI THE EDITI IDEA SORRY NOW
WE NEED TO STAY HERE AND WORK OUT THAT
WELL I SUPPOSE WE'LL
PRETTY MUCH
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU USE COVERS IT BASICALLY EASIER TO HAVE A N HAVE A NEUTRAL COLOUR ON THE BASE
NO WE'RE DESIGNING THE REMOTE CONTROL NOW BUT TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A NEUTRAL BASE COLOUR THAN TO HAVE A FLASHY
IT IS MORE TRENDY
THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE
OH WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT IT
UH YOU COULD USE IT FOR THE CHANNELS AND FOR THE VOLUME
BUT IT'S HAS NO REAL ADDED VALUE
YEAH BUT IF IT HAS NO FUNCTION THEN
BASICALLY OUT
I DON'T SEE THE
DO YOU HAVE ALL YOUR ANSWERS
OKAY
YES YOU CAN COLOUR RUBBER YEAH
DID YOU MANAGE
OKAY
AH
HELLO
NO JUST UH ASK IF IF HE COULD MANAGE
I HAVE A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION
HEY EVERYTHING ALRIGHT
DID YOU MANAGE
OKAY
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION
THAT'S TRUE
HUH
ALRIGHT
I HAVE A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION
I HAVE A COMPLETE LIST OF UH EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN USE ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT ALL AV AVAILABLE
I HAVE NO I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCE INFORMATION BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO GO ON NOW
YEP THAT'S RIGHT
LET'S SEE WHERE MY
PRESENTATION IS
OKAY UM THIS I MENTIONED BEFORE
EVERY FEATURE FOR OUR REMOTE CONTROL NEEDS TO HAVE THEIR OWN OPERATING ELECTRONIC DEVICES
WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THAT
THEN WARNING UH THERE HAS TO BE A CHIP IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL
AND THE CHIP REQUIREMENTS UH NEEDED FOR A NORMAL BUTTON UH IS JUST A SIMPLE CHIP UH SCROLL WHEEL AND L. C. D. IS AN ADVANCED
OF COURSE THIS IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIS
SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THAT IN A MINUTE
THE AVAILABLE UH COMPONENTS FOR ENERGY ARE WE HAVE A BASIC BATTERY A HAND AN UH DYNAMO LIKE IN UH OLD TORCHES
WE HAVE A KIN UH KINETIC PROVISION THEN YOU HAVE TO SHAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL TO GET THE ENERGY
AND WE HAVE SOLAR CELLS
I SUGGEST THAT WE UH DECIDE ON THAT ONE UH IMMEDIATELY
THEN I HAVE ALL LISTS
SO
MY PERSONAL UH FAV FAVOURITE IS THE KINETIC PROVISION BECAUSE UH I HA
I THINK SO YES
YES
YES
BECAUSE I HAD THE INFORMATION UH YOU TAKE UH THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU PICK IT UP AT LEAST TWO TIMES A DAY
SO THEN IT'S ALREADY SHAKEN AND GIVES ENERGY
OR
THINK
HMM
HMM
OTHER OPTIONS ARE SOLAR CELLS HAND DYNAMO AND BASIC BATTERY
ONLY BASIC BATTERY
OKAY BUT I THINK THIS IS NOT A R
YEAH
YEAH BUT I THINK THIS RULES OUT OUR UNIT OUR RECHARGEABLE UNIT
THIS IS REALLY A REALLY BASIC BATTERY A NORMAL BATTERY
HUH
OKAY THAT'S UH
OKAY
OKAY BUT THEN WE DON'T OFFER A RE CHARGEMENT FUNCTION
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS
EXACTLY
ALRIGHT
RIGHT
YEP
NEXT ONE IS CURVING
UH WE CAN MAKE A MODEL THAT HAS ONE CURVE TWO OR THREE
AND UH UH TH UH THE SHAPE
OF COURSE UH THE MORE CURVES THE MORE EXPENSIVE
EXACTLY
YES
HMM
HMM
I THINK ONE CURVE IS UH FINE
MORE EXPENSIVE
MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE
EXACTLY
AND I BELIEVE EVEN THAT THE R THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS WE HAVE ON PUTTING THINGS IN IT UH GOES DOWN WITH EXACTLY
MATERIAL
I HAVE TO OFFER A PLASTIC RUBBER WOOD OR TITANIUM
UH IF WE CHOOSE PLASTIC WE CANNOT CHOOSE SOLAR CELLS FOR ENERGY
IF WE CHOOSE TITANIUM UH WE CANNOT USE MORE THAN ONE CURVE
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT SO FAST
MM
MM
OKAY
NO
BUT I THINK WOOD IS NOT AN OPTION EITHER
OKAY
HMM
OKAY
MY PERSONAL THOUGHT WAS UH RUBBER BECAUSE I HAD AN EMAIL I BELIEVE IT WAS FROM YOU UH F AGAINST FALLING
HMM
OKAY
UH
MM
YEAH
MM
I THINK WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON THIS ANYWAY
UH BECAUSE IF WE MAKE REMOVEABLE COVERS IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THOSE MAT MATERIALS
WE HAVE NO MORE THAN THIS
SO
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
OKAY
ALRIGHT
THEN I PROCEED BUT I NEED TO KNOW AFTER THIS MEETING
SO INTERFACE UH I HAVE FOUR THINGS TO OFFER PU UH NORMAL PUSH BUTTONS OF COURSE
UM UH WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE ON THAT ONE
WE HAVE A LARGE HISTORY OUR COMPANY ON PUSH BUTTONS
SCROLL WHEELS UH THOSE CAN BE PUSHED AS WELL ALTHOUGH THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE
UM LIQUID CRYSTAL COLOUR DISPLAY AND UM
WHAT IS THIS
OKAY AND IF WE USE RUBBER I ALREADY MENTIONED THAT WE CAN ONLY USE RUBBER BUTTONS
SO RUBBER CAN ONLY MATCH WITH RUBBER
WHICH ONE OF THOSE ARE WE GONNA USE
PUSH BUTTONS THAT'S B UH I THINK BASIC
HUH
NO
I THINK THE CHANNELS
OH
YEAH
HUH
HUH
HMM
BUT
HUH
OH
AH SO BUT IT LOOKS COOL
MM NO
OH
AH
FLASHY AND YEAH
I THINK WOULD BE COOL SCROLL WHEEL
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH UH IF WE TAKE A NORMAL SCROLL WHEEL WITHOUT THE PUSHING THEN IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE
WE CAN DO THAT
THINK
AH WE DON'T NEED IT BUT IT'S UH IT'S DESIGN A DESIGN THING
I THINK THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THAT
OF COURSE WE HAVE UH A YOUNG TARGET GROUP
SO THEY MIGHT FIND THAT ATTRACTIVE IN A REMOTE CON
OKAY
SO PUSH BUTTONS WE WILL USE
UH L. C. D. SCREEN
IS THAT S
UH I ONLY KNOW THAT IF WE ARE USING THAT WE NEED ANO UH AN ADVANCED CHIP IN IT
AND THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE
I HAVE NO IDEA
I HAVE NO ABSOLUTE NUMBERS
I ONLY HAVE
YEAH BUT I DON'T THINK ROOM IS REALLY AN ISSUE
MM-HMM
OKAY
ELECTRONICS UH THE FIRST ONE IS THE CHIP
UH THAT'S NO LONGER AN OPTION IT HAS TO BE AN ADVANCED ONE NOW
'CAUSE WE HAVE THE L. C. D. SCREEN
THEN WE HAVE AN INFRARED SENDER I THINK THAT'S BASIC WE CANNOT DO WITHOUT
OTHERWISE IT'S NOT S A REMOTE CONTROL
AND WE HAVE THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND SPEAKER THE VOICE RECOGNITION THING
ARE WE GONNA DO THAT OR NOT
I ONLY HAVE UH UH RELATIVE INFORMATION
OH HOW DID YOU
THAT GOES ALSO FOR THE SCROLL WHEEL BY THE WAY
HMM
YEAH
HMM
BUT DON'T WE HAVE ANY W UH INFORMATION ABOUT SCROLL WHEEL
SCROLL WHEEL
IF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THAT
THAT'S STRANGE BECAUSE THAT'S THE SAME STORY
IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARY LIKE AN L. C. D. BUT IT'S JUST IT ADDS SOMETHING TO THE DESIGN
HMM
NO
OH THAT'S R
BUT I THINK UH WE NOW ALREADY HAVE TO UH IMPLEMENT UH AN ADVANCED CHIP
SO IT'S M
NO BUT THAT'S THAT'S OKAY
THERE IS STILL TIME
YES THIS WAS UH THE LAST M. S.
I HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE
HMM
HMM I AGREE
HMM
HMM
NO
YEAH UH I AGREE
OKAY AGREEMENT
MM-HMM
THAT'S TRUE
HMM
HMM
OH THAT'S TRUE
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
BUT I THINK ACCORDING TO MY INFORMATION THIS WOULD BE TWO CURVES
WE HAVE ONE LEFT AND ONE RIGHT AND THAT DISABLES WHAT WAS IT AGAIN
IT'S SOME IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT DO THEN
OKAY THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
THAT'S ONLY FOR THE TITANIUM
WE DON'T HAVE
YES
THEN W YEAH BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT
SO WE HAVE
WE HAVE NO
BUT THEY UH
THEY TH THESE WHA ARE WHAT THEY CALL THE CURVES
THIS SIDE THIS SIDE THIS IS HOW THEY COUNT
NO NO
THIS IS WHAT THEY UH WHAT THEY MEAN
OKAY THAT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD
IT'S LIKE THIS
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
YEP
SO I CAN UH QUI OH
I CAN QUICKLY MAKE A CONCLUSION
OF WHAT WE HAVE DECIDED SO FAR
HMM
HMM
ME TOO
HMM
HMM
I WOULD PREFER ROUND
BUT DOESN'T MATTER DOESN'T MATTER
THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL THINK
HMM
HMM
HUH
IT CAN BE CURVED
YES
I WOULD CURVE THE WHOLE ACTUALLY
I WOULD CURVE THE WHOLE
LIKE UM LIKE IT HANGS OVER YOUR HAND A LITTLE BIT
THEN IT WILL BOUNCE AND YOU DON'T DROP IT SO EASILY
YEAH SOMETHING LIKE THAT YES
YES EXACTLY
I THINK CONTINUE LIKE THAT
THEN THERE'S ALSO ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE ELECTRONICS
YEAH
LET'S MAKE IT YELLOW THEN
UH
MAYBE ONCE WE CAN MAKE A SPECIAL EDITION IN ACCORDING WITH CHIQUITA
HAVE OURSELVES SPONSORED
UH BUT IT'S A GOOD TRADE OFF FOR THEM IF THEY CAN HAVE THEIR LOGO ON IT
MM-HMM
THEY MIGHT WANNA BE THE FIRST ONES TO UH
OH PERHAPS THEY CAN USE IT
OR GIVE A SPECIAL EDITION UH WITH WITH
MM
I THINK THIS IS POSSIBLE
HUH
IT DOESN'T MATTER
YOU CAN ACTUALLY UH PLACE A CHIP FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN AND AT THE BOTTOM AND AND WIRE IT
DOESN'T MATTER
I THINK ON TOP
MM-HMM
IT IS I BELIEVE ALSO ABLE TO TALK
I HAVE A SAMPLE UH SAMPLE SENSOR AND THE SPEAKER SENSOR
UH THE SPEAKER SENSOR WE ALREADY HAVE BUT S I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY EXACTLY MEAN BY A SAMPLE SENSOR
COULD IT TALK BACK
LIKE UH G UH GIVE CONFIRMATION OR SOMETHING
I THINK IT CAN
I THINK IF YOU HAVE A A SPEECH RECOGNITION COMPONENT THEN A S SPEAKING COMPONENT IS NOT THAT HARD TO TO PUT IN EITHER
HMM
HMM
HMM
BUT
MM-HMM
YEAH
HMM
HMM
MM
HMM
WE ALREADY HAVE A SOUND COMPONENT BY THE WAY FOR THE BEEP
SO BEEP
HMM
I'M NOT SURE
I SHOULD BE GETTING NEW INFORMATION I GUESS
YES
BUT WE HAVE
ANY COMPANY LOGO
WE HAVE YES BUT AND YELLOW
I WOULD CHANGE
I WOULD TAKE A YELLOW REMOTE CONTROL
TO HAVE IT FLASHY TO HAVE IT IT'S FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
NEED DO BE DIFFERENT
HMM
BUT WE NEED TO BE DIFFERENT
MM-HMM
HUH
IT'S EITHER BLACK COVER WITH YELLOW BUTTONS OR VICE VERSA
AND I WOULD SAY TAKE A YELLOW COVER AND BLACK BUTTONS
TO BE DIFFERENT
YEAH WE HAVE SO MANY COLOURS ALREADY
SO
OH NO THAT I THINK IT'S GOOD THING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN
WELL
MM-HMM
I STILL DON'T HAVE MY SCROLL WHEEL THOUGH
UH THAT'S NAH THAT'S TRUE
NO FORGET IT
NO LOOK IT
NO THAT'S NOT MY POINT
IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S FUNCTIONAL BUT IT'S JUST TO ADD TO THE DESIGN TO HAVE IT FLASHY
IT IT HAS NO FUNCTION I AGREE
I AGREE
OH SO MANY THINGS HAVE NO FUNCTION JUST DESIGN
MM-HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
LET'S VOTE ON IT
THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT ANY LONGER
WHAT DO YOU WANT
IN OR OUT
OKAY
YOU ARE OUT OF COURSE
YOU ARE OKAY CLEAR
I HAVE ALL MY ANSWERS YES
HMM
HMM
HMM
THERE IS I HAVE ONE QUESTION
HMM
HMM
I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION WITH THE MATERIAL BUT I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION THAT
WE'VE CHOSEN RUBBER
NO BUT CAN WE MAKE YELLOW RUBBER
I THINK SO
OKAY
MM
OKAY
HMM
YEAH SH NOT QUITE
YOU WILL SEE UH
WOAH
YEAH
MM UH NOTHING SPECIAL
UH
YEAH THE FOR UH THE TRENDY UH STUFF
A LITTLE BIT
I UH NOW WILL SHOW IT
OKAY
YEAH I HAD THE SAME
IT JUST UH
SHUTS ITSELF DOWN AND
OH
YEP
MM UH-HUH
I BET
OH OKAY
UM
YEAH
A RECHARGEABLE MAYBE
RE RECHARGEABLE BASI
YEAH
YEP
BASIC
OKAY
OKAY
BUT
BUT
IT DEP
BUT
YEAH
YEAH
DEPENDS ON THE USER
YEAH
YEAH
NO
NO
ARE ARE WE FOCUSSI FOCUSSING ON ON THE
BUT
BUT
NOT THAT BUT ARE WE FOCUSSING ON THE UH YOUNGER PEOPLE OR THE ELDER PEOPLE
YOUNGER OKAY
YEAH THAT'S OKAY
NAH THAT'S
BUT
BUT TH THE YOUNGER PEOPLE MY INVESTIGATION TURNS OUT THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT A LITTLE BIT UH MATERIAL THAT THAT IS UH SPONGY AND UH
SO
A SC
YEAH
YEAH YOU GET
NO
SCROLL WHEEL
UH I DON'T KNOW
YEAH THAT'S IT
YEAH
FOR THE FUTURE
YEAH
YEP
YEP
UM UH
THE MOST OF THEM UM
UM UH MORE THAN UH SIXTY PERCENT
YEAH
MEAN OF UH SEVENTY PERCENT I THINK
UH I'M I HAVE TO LOOK IT UP
NO
NO ONLY
AH
I DON'T KNOW
ON THE MOST SPEE
BUT
YEAH FOR THE FUTURE
YEAH
PEOPLE
RI
SO ONLY R RIGHT HANDED
BUT IT BUT IT'S ONLY RIGHT HANDED THEN
NOT FOR THE LEFT
OR
WHERE
WHER
OH IN THE BACK OKAY
OH YEAH YEAH
OKAY
OH YEAH YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH YEAH
YEAH
I THOUGHT IT
WELL IT IT'S YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
NO IT MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO LOOK UH WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT
SO I CAN UH SHOW MY UH INVESTIGATION
YEAH MAYBE IT'S BETTER
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
UM WHERE IS THAT
WHERE IS TH
OH
UH
YEAH
MM I FORGOT THAT
OKAY NOW IT MUST BE THERE
YEAH HERE IT IS
OH YEAH
OKAY UH THE INVESTIGATION TURNS OUT THAT THE MOST APPEAR UH PEOPLE WANT UM UM UH LOOK AND FEEL LIKES IS UH UH THE S THE SAME AS BEFORE
BUT IT MUST BE W A LITTLE BIT FANCIER THAN UH THE THE LOOK OF IT
UM THE SECOND IMPORTANT THING IS UM THE IT MUST BE UH TECHNOL TECHNOLOGICAL UH INNOVA VATIVE
SO THAT'S THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS PERFECT I THINK AND NOT UH
YEAH THA THAT'S UH VERY IMPORTANT
AND A THIRD THING IS
UM YEAH IT'S UH SHOULD BE EASY TO USE SO NOT NOT TOO MUCH BU BUTTONS AND UH CHANNEL SELECTION
I THINK THAT'S UH WHAT YOU SHOWED IS UH PERFECT
AND WHAT THE PE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT IS UH IN PARIS AND AND IN MILAN UH IT SHOWED OUT THAT THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE UH ARE TRENDY
TH THEY YOU S YOU SEE IT IN THE CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING
AND UM THE CONTRAST UH OF IT IT MUST UH THE THE BUTTONS MUST A LITTLE BIT SPONGY MATERIAL
SO UH RUBBER I THINK UH TH THAT'S THE BEST
NO
SO WE ARE UH WE WERE FOCUSSING UH ON THE YOUNGER PEOPLE
SO THE ELDER YEAH THEY WANTED A LITTLE BIT OF WOOD IN IT AND UH THAT'S UH TH THAT'S NOT UH IMPORTANT NOW
YEAH
YEAH BUT
YEAH
'CAUSE UH N I I I I THOUGHT UH IT MAKES A YOUNG UH CLASSIC REMOTE WITH UH
YEAH THAT'S WHY I I D UH
DECIDED
WITH A FRUIT UH
COVER OV OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
UH
YEAH IN IN FORM OF AN UH VEGETABLE OR AN UH FRUIT MAYBE
AND
OH WHERE IS YOUR
A TRENDY
HERE HE HERE YOU CAN PUT A
UH MAYBE IT
BUT
YEAH
ALL UH VEG UH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE ROUND
SO IT'S BETTER
YEAH
TWO
BUT IT
BUT IT'S THAT THAT'S FOR THE COMFORT
IT'S IT'S NOT FOR THE TRENDY THING OF IT
YEAH
OKAY YEAH
SO THE NO
WE M
FORM
YEAH
BUT YOU CAN MAKE UH IF YOU WANT TO USE A FRUIT IN UH IN UH
UH
HEY YOU
YOU CAN MAKE IT LIKE
LIKE THIS
WELL
OH
AS A EXAMPLE
BUT
I D
HMM
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
AND SPEECH W RECOGNITION
ARE WE
WE
LITTLE UH VOICE UH
RECORD AND A UH NO
YEAH
FORM OF FRUIT
IT'S BETTER
YEAH
YEP
AND WHAT ABOUT OH
WHAT ABOUT A BUTTON FOR YOUR UH FAVOURITE CHANNEL
UH YEAH
WITH THE EXTRA CONTROLS
UH
UH ONE ONE SET
YEAH YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UP UH
ONE OF THE FOUR
UH IT'S BETTER THAN I THINK
IT'S A FAVOURITE CHANNEL
WHAT
NEE UH ONE OF THE FOUR UH
IT'S BETTER TH
YEAH
HMM
MM
WHY
YEAH
UH-HUH
YEP
YEAH
PERFECT
YEAH IT'S PERFECT
YEAH
OKAY
TOP
W
ON THERE
NO
MM-HMM
BEEP
OH
YEP
OKAY
AH THAT'S FINE
ROUND
WH
WHY
IT'S THE COLOUR OF A
BUT THE YOU
THE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT UH A TRENDY UH REMOTE CONTROL
SO COLOURFUL UH IS
YEAH
YOU HAVE THE BASIC COLOURS BLUE GREEN RED
OH IT'S OKAY
YEAH
COLOURFUL YOU YOU
YEP
YEAH
YEAH
OH YEAH
YOU CAN
AH MAY
BUT UH UH SCROLL FOR A CHANNEL S SELECTION OR VOLUME
MA
OH OKAY
OH OKAY
OUT
I HAVE TO CALL THIS IN A FORM
AH
BUT WE HA W WE DON'T UH USE OUR RECO UH WE UH REMOVABLE COVER
NO HUH
MAYBE MAYBE LATER MAYBE WE CAN UH
CAN I CLOSE THIS
OH OKAY
THERE WE GO
OKAY HERE WE ARE AGAIN
DETAILED DESIGN OH COME ON
WELL AH S FORGOT TO INSERT THE MINUTES BUT IT'S ABOUT THE SAME THING WE DISCUSSED BEFORE
UH
COULD OPEN THAT ANYWAY THINK
OTHER DESIGN ANYWAY WE TOOK AS WE TOOK W WE TOOK RUBBER AS AS THE MATERIAL LAST TIME
WE ALSO THAT YOU'RE JUST BUSY WITH IT
TOOK THE ADVANCED CHIP TO T UH IMPLEMENT THE ADVANCED FEATURES
WELL WE DISCUSSED THE DESIGN NO SHARP CORNERS WE ROUNDED IT OFF LIKE YOU SEE ON THE OTHER SCREEN WHICH IS FINE
UM WE AGREED THAT THE COLOUR SHOULD BE B UH YELLOW AND BLACK
YELLOW IN THE BACK BECAUSE IT'S M TRENDY MORE TRENDY THAN BLACK ANYWAY
SO THEN WE CA YEAH
WE AGREED THAT WE WOULD IMPLEMENT BOTH THE L. C. D. AND SPEECH RECOGNITION BUT I'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT
'CAUSE SOME CHANGES IN THE FINANCES HAVE
LEFT US IMPLICATIONS ANYWAY
SO SO LIKE I SAID WE HAD NO INSIGHT IN FINANCES NO PRICES BUT WE HAVE 'EM NOW
AND IT'S BAD
ANYWAY
WE ARE
OH
PROTOTYPE PRESENTATION WELL FIRST YOU GUYS BUILT THE PROTOTYPE
SO YOU COULD COULD PRESENT THAT
BUT UM LET'S SEE WHAT BE HANDY TO DO
NEE NO YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND PRESENT THE W WE'LL SCRAP IT LATER BECAUSE
WHAT
OH THAT'S
HASN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH HUH
I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYWAY
YOU JUST COLOURED IT
MM-HMM
I LIKE THE MENU
MM-HMM
AND I SUPPOSE THE THE THE YELLOW IS NOT PRINTED ON THE ON THE RUBBER
IT'S IT'S PART OF THE RUBBER I SUPPOSE
I THINK THAT'S MORE I THINK THAT'S MORE DURABLE ANYWAY THAN PRINTED ON TO
OH YEAH
MM-HMM
OKAY
YEAH
OKAY
NOW IT'S MY TIME TO RUIN EVERYTHING
WELL NOT RUIN EVERYTHING BUT NO NAH
FINANCES THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE WHAT YOU DREW
WE HAVE BATTERY POWER WE HAVE ADVANCED CHIPS AND THE SAM THE SENSOR
THE SAMPLE SENSOR AND UH FOR SPEAK RECOGNITION ANYWAY
SO WHICH YOU SEE THE WHICH IS DE O ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PARTS
SO WELL WE HAVE SIN ONE CURVE A DESIGN
RUBBER DESIGN
AND WE HAD A SPECIAL COLOUR
SUPPOSE YELLOW IS A SPECIAL COLOUR
SO JUST HALF A EURO FOR YOU HAVE PUSHBUTTONS AND AN L. C. D. DISPLAY
YOU HAVE THE TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN EUROS IN PRODUCTION COST WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE TWELVE AND A HALF THAT WE ARE PERMITTED TO USE
SO EASY
WHAT DO WE SCRAP
WELL THINK I HAD THE BEST SOLUTION THAT I CAME UP WITH IS JUST TO S TAKE OUT THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
BECAUSE THE L. C. D. HAS MORE SUPPORT ON CUSTOMER SIDE
THERE ARE NINETY ONE PERCENT OF UH THE PEOPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
BUT NINETY PERCENT WHO FAVOUR AN L. C. D. DISPLAY AND ONLY SIXTY PERCENT THAT FAVOUR SPEECH RECOGNITION
I THINK IT'S ALSO HARDER TO
SO I JU I TOOK THAT OUT
SO AND SO IT'S STILL STUCK WITH THIRTEEN SO I HAD TO TAKE OUT THE SPECIAL COLOUR I SUPPOSE
AND YEAH I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE I COULD TAKE OUT
YEAH I COULD TAKE OUT THE PUSH BUTTONS BUT WE NEED THOSE
SO GENERALLY WHAT I CAME UP WITH IN ORDER TO BE COU TO TO HAVE PRODUCTION COST OF TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
SPE SCRAP SPEECH RECOGNITION AND THE SEPARATE COVERS CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE IF PEOPLE WANT IT WE'LL JUST THEN WE'LL DO IT IN BLACK
WE'LL JUST DELIVER IT IN BLACK HAVE THE IT HAS ALL THE FUNCTION THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE
AND IF YOU WANT IT IF YOU WANT THE CUSTOM DESIGN THEN YOU CAN BUY THE SEPARATE COVERS
YOU MAKE IT D ORANGE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT
IT WAS A BIG ISSUE BUT
I'LL JUST GO BACK
UH LET'S JUST LET'S SEE WHAT OKAY LET'S JUST SEE WHAT WE NO WE WE HAVE TO BE UNDER TWELVE AND A HALF
IT IT'S NOT UH THE PROJECT IS A NO GO IF WE GO OVER TWELVE AND A HALF SO
I THINK YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE ASS ASSIGNED TO DO REALLY TO TO SEE HOW B TH BOTH THOSE WORK TOGETHER
SO I THINK YEAH IT'S I THINK IT'S Y ONE OF THE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO UM
TO HELP PEOPLE UH TO MAKE TO KEEP THE PRODUCT TRENDY TOO
JUST KEEP YOU JUST MAKE NEW COVERS FOR THE FOR IT LIKE WE AGREED BEFORE
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S LEFT IS IS THE BASIC FUNCTION THAT UH THAT WE WANT OUR PRODUCT TO HAVE
BECAUSE THE EXPENSIVE PARTS ARE IN EITHER THE ADVANCED CHIP
BUT WE NEED THAT FOR THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
THEN AGAIN WE HAVE THE L. C. D. DISPLAY WHICH IS ALSO EXPENSIVE
B YEAH BUT THOSE GO TOGETHER
AND YEAH WE COULD TAKE OUT THE CURVE
COULD WE COULD TAKE OUT THE CURVE
IS THAT AN OPTION
FOR YOU
YEAH
I THINK IT'S IT IT DOES RUIN IT BUT THE FACT THAT I T TOOK THAT DECISION OR T
TOOK THIS EXAMPLE ACTUALLY NOT REALLY DECISION BUT THE EXAMPLE IS BECAUSE WE DO OFFER THE UM THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDING YOUR OWN CUSTOM COVERS
SO YOU CAN CHANGE ANY COLOUR YOU WANT
SO IT'S JUST YOU DELIVER A BASIC REMOTE CONTROL WITH A POSSIBILITY TO CHANGE YOU INTO WHATEVER YOU WANT
YOU CAN TAKE PLASTIC
BUT I D IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S STUCK INTO MY MIND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT REALLY CAME FORWARD FROM THE MARKETING RESEARCH IS THAT PEOPLE LIKE THE THE THE THE SQUISHY FEELING OF THE SPONGY FEELING OF THE AND IT REALLY MAKES IT ALSO MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM THE EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL PLASTIC
SO WHICH IN IN TURN RUBBER WOULD INCREASE DURABILITY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T BREAK
I AL LIKE I SAID I LOST THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND I LOST THE SPECIAL COLOUR WHICH WOULD MAKE THIS BLACK A BLACK AND GREY
YEAH THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S ENOUGH BECAUSE
I GUESS THOSE ARE THE BASIC COLOURS
SO OH
I THINK THOSE ARE BASIC COL
THEY WANT TO
TO ENSURE THE PROFIT
THAT THAT'S TH THAT'S THE ORDER
WE'RE JUST UH WE'RE THE PROJECT TEAM AND WE GOT OUR OUR ORDERS FROM THE PRO FROM THE BOSS OF OUR COMPANY WHICH SAY WE DON'T WANNA SPEND MORE THAN TWELVE FIFTY FOR THIS
BUT THAT'S NOT FOR OUR THAT'S NOT OUR DECISION TO TAKE
WE HAVE A BUDGET OF TWELVE FIFTY PER PRODUCT
SO
STICK THAT
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY BAD EITHER
I MEAN IF WE WE HAVE THE THE BACKUP OF OR THE BACKUP DESIGN THING
TO HAVE I THINK THEY WOULD DO
TH I THINK THEY DO LIKE BECAUSE YO WE YOU WE AGREE UPON THAT THE THAT THE THE THE COVER THING WAS A NICE IDEA
BECAUSE P YOU COULD HAVE ALL SORT OF DESIGNS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME JUST MANUFACTURING ONE PRODUCT
ONE BASIC PRODUCT WHICH YOU COULD TURN INTO ANY ANY TASTE YOU WANT
SO I THINK IT'S THE BEST SOLUTION TO MAKE THOSE CU CUSTOM COVERS FOR THE DESIGN ASPECT AND KEEP THE FUNCTIONALITY BETWEEN OF WITHIN THE TH THE BOUNDARIES OF THE YOUR F UH YOUR BUDGET
SO
WELL I DON'T THINK YEAH
IS IT WORTH IS IT IS IT DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING TO THE CUSTOMER
LIKE IT LIKE WE DON'T CARE WE DON'T CARE THAT YOU HAD TO
TRUE BUT WE DID WE DIDN'T GET THAT
SO I THINK IT'S IT SHOULD EITHER BE A PACK
MAYBE WE SH THAT SHOULD BE SOLD IN IN THE S IN STORES WITH WITH A STANDARD COVER OR SOMETHING
BUT
THEY COULD BUT UH
IT'S AN OPTION BUT YEAH IT'S TRUE
SO ACTUALLY UH IT'S NOT THAT MUCH OF AN INCREASE BUT YEAH
WE CANNOT CONTACT THEM
IT'S JUST THE ORDER THAT WE GOT
SO THAT'S WHAT WE GOTTA GO WITH
SO IT'S EITHER ONE FI JUST JUST TO GET IT F JUST TO GET IT THROUGH FINAL IT'S EITHER TURNED INTO PLASTIC
DROP THE SQUISHY FEEL MAKE IT MAKE IT MORE BREAKABLE UM OR TURN IT YELLOW
SO
IT'S UH SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON
I SAY LOSE THE CURVE
OH THAT'S TRUE WE COULD LOSE THE C YEAH I FORGOT THAT SORRY
UH THE CURVE
SO THAT'S JUST THIS ONE JUST D THIS IS THE BANANA CURVE
SO THIS WOULD THIS WOULD BE STRAIGHT
NO UH NO THAT WOULD BE A CURVE INSIDE THE THING I GUESS
NO WOULD JU THEN IT WOULD JUST BE A STRAIGHT REMOTE
JUST LIKE LIKE THAT
WHICH WOULD YEAH TURN IT INTO SOMETHING FAR MORE ORDINARY
WE COULD MAKE IT YELLOW THEN BUT
YOU SECOND THAT YOU SECOND THAT WE LOSE THE CURVE
OKAY YEAH
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP THE CURVE TO SEPARATE IT FROM THE REST OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WORLD SO TO SPEAK
SO WE KEEP THE CURVE
SO THE ONLY ONLY SOLUTION IS EITHER TO USE THE L Y LOSE THE YELLOW OR LOSE THE RUBBER
AND I'M IN FAVOUR OF KEEPING THE RUBBER BECAUSE IT HAS MORE MORE ADVANTAGES THAN THE COLOUR YELLOW HAS
MM-HMM
YEAH UM I GUESS PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR THAT
SO I THINK WE CAN TAKE THAT OPTION AND JUST WITH UH WITH THE IDEA IN THE BACK OF OUR HEAD THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMISE YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
SO I THINK THAT WOULD STILL MAKE IT A NICE PRODUCT
OKAY WE'RE FINAL ON THAT
SO IT'S TOO BAD WE CAN'T MAKE THE WHOLE SUPER THING
BUT ANYWAYS WE'RE HERE
UM YEAH
THIS WE DISCUSSED JUST NOW
THAT'S JUST NOW JUST WE COULD JUST DISCUSS HOW THE PROJECT WENT
I MEAN WAS KIND OF
I SORT OF EXPECTED THAT EVERYTHING WOULD TURN OUT THIS WAY BUT BECAUSE YOU YEAH EVERYTHING CANNOT BE FOR FREE
WE DIDN'T I THINK IT WAS TOO BAD WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL INFO THE LAST TIME
BECAUSE THAT WAS I TH IT WAS REALLY ESSENTIAL REALLY TO MA BECAUSE WE SPENT UH UH ENTIRE STAGE DESIGNING A PRODUCT OF WHICH WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WOULD COST
SO WE JUST PUT SOMETHING I THINK IT'S REALLY NOR NOT IN STROKE WITH REALITY ACTUALLY
SO
YEAH
YEAH I THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN
MATERIALS WOULD BE OK AT LEAST THE LAST MEETING I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HAD TO HAVE THAT
SO I SUPPOSE
YEAH LET'S SEE IF IT SELLS
I MEAN I SUPPOSE THIS SELLS BECAUSE IT'S VERY VERY EXTENDED
BUT
I SUPPOSE IT SELLS BECAUSE IT'S GOOD
I MEAN IT'S GOT EVERYTHING FOR THE FOR THE REASONABLE PRICE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GONNA COST ANYWAY
OKAY
HAVE BEEN MET OKAY
YEAH
THEY'RE STUCK UNDER MENU
FOR THE MENU
I THINK THOSE ARE TOTALLY MET BECAUSE WE WE REALLY TOOK THEM FOR THE THEY HAVE THE FEEL THEY WANT THEY HAVE THE SIMPLICITY THEY WANT
I THINK IT'S VERY UH VERY WELL MET
EITHER TWO OR ONE MAYBE
I THINK WE TOOK THAT EVERYTHING THEY WANTED INTO CONSIDERATION
SO IT COULD EITHER BE A TWO OR A ONE
ONE AND A HALF
JUST CREATE OUR OWN OPTION
YEAH
IT'S PERFECT
EVEN FOR DEAF PEOPLE YEAH
IT'S I DON'T THINK IT'S PERFECT BUT WE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TO GET IT BACK
BECAUSE IF IT'S STUCK IN YOU COUCH YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT
MAYBE YOU CAN HEAR IT
BUT I MEAN WE TRIED SO I THINK IT THAT'S THAT DESERVES A ONE
DEFINITELY
I'D USE AN REMOTE CONTROL
IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD UH-HUH
I THINK BUT WE DIDN'T EVEN THERE WAS NO ISSUE ON MAKING A MANUAL ACTUALLY
WE DIDN'T REALLY DISCUSS IT BUT
I DON'T THINK IT TAKES NO IT REALLY DOES DOESN'T TAKE TIME TO LEARN I THINK
WE TOOK IT S IT'S SO EASY WE HAVE SO LITTLE BUTTON EVERYTHING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF REALLY
SO I THINK THAT'S YEAH WE DIDN'T IT'S EITHER TWO OR ONE I GUESS
MAYBE IT'S A TWO BECAUSE D UH THE L. C. D. IS A LITTLE IS A LITTLE NEW AND THERE IS THERE ARE SOME OPTION HIDDEN UNDER THE MENU BUTTON
SO I MIGHT MAKE THIS A TWO INSTEAD OF A ONE I GUESS
SO JUST MAKE THAT A TWO
YOU CAN USE THE L. C. D. IN A GOOD WAY
I THINK SO
I THINK IT'S PERFECT THE W WHERE IT IS WHAT IT CAN DO IF IT USEFUL
I THINK SO
NO Y I MEAN IN THE L. C. D. SCREEN THE SMALL SCREEN
WHAT DOES IT DISPLAY
WELL I THOUGHT IT WAS I THOUGHT IT WAS I THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WANTED PREVIEWS ON THEIR I'M NOT SURE IF THAT EVEN POSSIBLE
BUT 'CAUSE IT'S THIS REQUIRES A QUITE QUITE A BIT OF BAND WIDTH
I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE REALLY
BUT
THE THEY DIDN'T REALLY DEFINE IN WHAT SHOULD BE USED FOR
BUT I THINK IN FOR EXAMPLE LIKE T. V. GUIDES I THINK THAT'S THAT TH THAT YOU CAN TRANSMIT THROUGH IT AND EVERYTHING
JUST FOR EXTRA INFORMATION ON YOUR PROGRAMMES
BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE LIKE LIKE MENUS OR P HOW ABOUT PREFERENCES OF YOUR UH WITH CONFIGURING YOUR REMOTE CONTROL FOR FAVOURITE YOUR FAVOURITE CHANNEL FOR EXAMPLE
HOW DO YOU CONFIGURE THAT
SO THAT COULD BE DONE BY L. C. D. DISPLAY
I THINK IT'S GOOD
NO MAYBE IT'S NOT A ONE BECAUSE IT'S WE'RE NOT USING IT PERFECTLY
WE DIDN'T GIVE IT I DON'T THING OVER DISCUSSING
NOW WE GAVE IT ENOUGH THOUGHT THOUGH
I THINK WE D SHOULD JUST LOWER THIS
MAYBE MAYBE IT'S A THREE THOUGH
WE COULD'VE USED IT MORE EFFECTIVELY PROBABLY
YEAH WE ARE USING IT BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT POORLY USED BUT IT'S NOT EFFICIENTLY USED I THINK
WE COULD HAVE EV EVEN LOST THE SELECTION BUTTON AND UH DONE EVERYTHING VIA L. C. D. SELECTION
IT'S NOW IT'S JUST EXTRA TO ILLUSTRATE IM UH EXTRA FEATURES BUT OKAY
CAN YOU TALK TO REMOTE CONTROL
WELL IT CAN'T TALK ANYMORE
SO WE SCRAP THAT
OH YEAH JUST TO BE A PRICK BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR REMOTE CONTROL IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
BUT YOU C YOU CAN TALK TO IT
WELL WE DID TAKE EVERYTHING INTO CONSIDERATION OF COURSE
UH THE SHAPE I SHAPE IS I
I THINK WE YEAH I THINK THAT'S OKAY
YEAH SPECIAL CO BUT WE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT IT'S CUSTOMISABLE TO THE FASHI
WE DON'T HAVE IT WE DO HAVE IT IT'S JUST SOLD AS A PACKAGE
IT DOES IT'S NOT PART OF THE BASIC PRODUCT
IT THAT THAT'S WHAT I CALL TRENDY
I MEAN THE SHAPE IS TRENDY
THE THE SH THE THE FUNCTIONS ARE TRENDY
IT'S JUST THE COLOURS THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE BASIC MODEL
BECAUSE YOU HA IT'S JUST NOT AFFORDABLE AT THE MOMENT
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING IT IN A F A DIFFERENT COLOUR
OVERALL SCORE
ONE TWO THREE
SIXTEEN
TWO TWO POINT SOME TWO POINT SOMETHING
TWO AND TWO THIRDS
IT'S OKAY BUT THAT'S YO M MOSTLY IT'S IT'S INFLUENCED BY THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT SPEECH RECOGNITION
'CAUSE YEAH THAT GIVES YOU A SEVEN WHICH RUINS YOUR YOUR AVERAGE
WITHOUT THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE UNDER IT WOULDN'T YEAH IT WOULD BE UNDER TWO
SO I THINK WE HAVE EVEN WITH THIS IT'S REASONABLE
WELL I THINK IT'S TWO IS OKAY
YEAH TWO IS PRETTY GOOD
DEFINITELY
YEAH
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY I I DO ADMIT THAT WE D DID MISS A LITTLE OR DIDN'T SP DIDN'T TALK TALK ENOUGH ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE L. C. D. DISPLAY
WE COULD HAVE USED IT MORE EFFICIENTLY WE JUST DIDN'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY
SO LIKE I SAID CHANGING CHANNELS EVERYTHING HIDDEN IN YOUR L. C. D. DISPLAY SO YOU JUST NEED THE NAVIGATION BUTTONS TO DO EVERYTHING
I THINK WE DIV I THINK WE DID VERY WELL UH EV EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THIS SCORE WE DID QUITE WELL
IT JUST LOOKING FOR IMPROVEMENTS WHAT WHAT YOU COULD HAVE IMPROVED
SO
THEY SH THEY SHOULD GET KIDS AND JUST STICK 'EM IN T. V. AND SAY CHANGE THE CHANNEL
I DON' THINK SO
UH IT'S JUST NOT IT IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE
OR YOUR SH YOU SHOULD LOSE THE L. C. D. SCREEN PROBABLY BUT I THINK THAT'S I THINK THE L. C. D. SCREEN IS MORE WORTH THAN SPEECH RECOGNITION
DEFINITELY
OKAY THAT WAS THAT
SO THAT'S THE FINAL PRODUCT WITHOUT THE SPEAKERS I GUESS
LET'S SEE WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE THE ANOTHER ONE
HMM
YEAH WE EVALUATE THE PRODUCT
GENERAL PROJECT WHAT'S I IN FOR EXAMPLE I THOU I THOUGHT WE WERE PRETTY CREATIVE IN WHAT WE CREATED
WE TOOK THE WHOLE NEW APPROACH OF MAKING EXCHANGEABLE COVER FOR EXAMPLE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY CREATIVE BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER NEVER EVER LISTED SOMEWHERE
WELL
ANYWAYS
YEAH LEADERSHIP IS UP TO YOU
I MEAN PERHAPS I SCREWED UP BECAUSE I D PUT A PUT A SPEECH RECOGNITION INTO IT
BUT THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE
I THINK WE DID PRETTY WELL AS TEAM WORK THOUGH
BECAUSE YEAH WAS VERY HARD TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER IF YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE IN THE MEANTIME
BECAUSE WHEN I GOT THE WHEN I GOT THE INPUT FOR THE FINANCIAL RESULTS INITIALLY OF COURSE I WANTED TO CONTACT YOU
SAY LOOK THIS IS YOU'RE DOING THE WRONG THING YOU'RE S YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME NOW BECAUSE WE'RE IMPLEMENTING STUFF THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD
SO IT WOULD BE BETTER IF Y IF THERE WAS MORE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN UH BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WOULD W YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY DO
EITHER CALL OR EMAIL SOMEONE
SO THAT WAS TOO BAD CON WAS IMPOSSIBLE HERE ANYWAYS
IT DIDN'T HAVE OR DIDN'T KNEW WHAT THEY COSTS OR WHATEVER
THERE WAS JUST TOO LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THINGS ACTUALLY COST AND IF YOU COULD USE THEM
SO THAT WAS A LITTLE UNCLEAR I SUPPOSE
I THINK A SMARTBOARD SMARTBOARD IS PRETTY COOL
I THINK UH S ESPECIALLY FOR DESIGN ISSUES IT'S VERY EASY JUST TO GIVE YOUR GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS A LITTLE IT'S EASIER TO SHARE THEM
IT'S A LITTLE LESS IT THE RESPONSE TIME IS LE IT'S VERY BAD
IT'S GOOD TO VISUALISE EVERYTHING BUT I THINK THE RESPONSE TIME SHOULD COULD BE A LOT BETTER
DEFINITELY
YEAH IT'S TRUE
NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
NO YOU DON'T
I JIN I DIDN'T CHECK THE FINISH BUTTON
I JUST YOU JUST DITCH IT AND YOU CAN COPY IT OR WHATEVER
UH ONLY IF YOU UH CHECK THE NOTES OR PRESS DONE
THEN IT UM THEN YOU CAN THEN IT EXPORTS TO WORD AUTOMATICALLY
BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO CHECK EITHER ONE OF THOSE TWO
YOU CAN JUST PREVIEW YOUR P YOU CAN JUST PREVIEW YOUR PAGE IN THE IN THE PROGRAMME
OKAY BEFORE STARTING A NE A NEW PAGE
OKAY THAT COULD BE B
OKAY
YEAH OKAY
THAT'S
YEAH IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE OKAY
ANY NEW IDEAS
YEAH MORE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BETWEEN UH THAT'S THE THING I NOTICED THAT COMMUNICATION IS VERY UM VERY IMPORTANT
BECAUSE IF YOU GET NEW INFORMATION IT'S ESSENTIAL F FOR THE OTHER TEAM MATES TO KNOW THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
BECAUSE YOU WOULD AVOID MAKING DOING EXTRA WORK BECAUSE YOU WERE DOING EXTRA WORK NOW UH M WORKING ON THE ON THE SPEECH RECOGNITION
YOU HAVE LIMITATION BOTH ON THE TECHNICAL ON THE D ON THE DESIGN SIDE
SO I THINK THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
BUT THAT'S I THINK IT'S MORE OF A A SETTING HERE THAT YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE THAN UH THAN SOMEWHERE ELSE
SO
YEAH I THINK SO
AND L LESS P LESS SPAM PROBABLY
I'M NOT SURE I I'M NOT SURE YOU GOT SPAMMED AS WELL
BUT I GET SPAMMED LIKE EVERY T EVERY TWO MINUTES THERE WAS A THERE WAS ANOTHER EMAIL ABOUT MASTER CLASSES OR SOMETHING
SO WHICH WERE TOTALLY USELESS ACTUALLY
I THOUGHT I SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK INTO THEM BUT THEY WERE ALL USELESS
SO I JUST
OH OKAY
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY UH MORE INFORMATION IT'S JUST ALWAYS THE SAME HERE
SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF A
IT WOULD CHANGE BUT NOT FOR ME
SO I'D I HAD NO EXTRA INFORMATION TO GO ON THAT ONE THAN WHAT YOU GIVE ME ACTUALLY
I COULDN'T DO ANY RESEARCH MYSELF OR I SEE THAT'S YEAH W I COULD HAVE DONE A LITTLE EXTRA WORK PROBABLY THEN
BUT I WAS BUSY ENOUGH ANYWAY
SO
ANY NEW IDEAS FOUND
OR IS THAT A 'CAUSE UH YEAH IT'S WELL PROBABLY IS
I HAVE NO CLUE
THAT'S LIKE IT
SHOULD I IF THE PROJECT IS EVALUATED AND IT WAS IT WAS IN B WITHIN BUDGET WE SHOULD CELEBRATE
SO
UH OKAY THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT
UH
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE SHOULD STILL DO THOUGH UH T LET'S SEE WHAT ALL YOUR TASKS WERE FINISHED RIGHT
WHAT YOU HA FROM YOUR ASSISTANT
SO LET'S
OKAY I SHOULD I THINK I SH I STILL HAVE THE THE TOTAL REPORT TO FINISH UP
I THINK WE TOOK VERY LITTLE TIME NOW BECAUSE
YEAH WE'RE IN AGREEMENT EVERYTHING THE DESIGN IS OKAY
THE ONE THING WE MISSED THOUGH
WE DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT NAME
HOW ABOUT YOU COOK A HOW ABOUT YOU COOK UP A PRODUCT NAME
JUST OH THINK OF A CATCHY NAME
I'LL BE WORKING ON THIS UNTIL THE BEEP UNTIL IT BEEPS
SO
WHAT
FRUIT
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO RESEMBLE A BANANA
IT'S NOT YELLOW ANYWAY
IT'S NOT YELLOW ANYMORE
IT IS CURVED BUT
NO IT'S
HMM
REAL REACTION FUTURE R. C.
STEP INTO THE FUTURE OF OF REMOTE CONTROLLING YOUR T. V.
NO THAT'S A THAT'S A CATCHY SLOGAN
CONTROL YOUR REMOTE CONTROL
I GO FOR FUTURE R. C. PROBABLY
SOMETHING LIKE
IT'S SHORT F
REAL REACTOR
UH THAT THAT'S
THAT MAKES ME THINK OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAN A REMOTE CONTROL REALLY
I'M NOT SURE
REAL REACTION IN A REAL
REAL REACTOR
DIDN'T NOTICE
MM
I TAKE F YEAH TAKE A BANANA
HMM
NO NOT LIKE THAT
IT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE LONGER BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PRODUCT NAME THAT YOU F PRINT ON A BOX
JUST WRITE OUT TRIPLE LIKE A WORD TRIPLE R. C. TRIPLE STRIPE OH
TRIPLE DASH R. DASH S S C.
YEAH
R. DASH C.
DASH
TRIPLE R. OR TRIPLE R. C.
HOW ABOUT DO BOTH
SURE IF IT LOOKS STUPID
UH I THINK THAT THE THE R. C. TOGETHER TAKES AWAY THE THE THE IMAGE OF IT'S A TRIPLE
UH THE FIRST THE FIRST ONE LOOKS LIKE IT'S A TRIPLE REMOTE CONTROL BUT IT'S ONLY A SINGLE REMOTE CONTROL
AND IT'S ESPECIALLY ON THE TRIPLE R. THAT'S IMPORTANT
THE REAL REACTION REMOTE
YEAH TRIPLE R. YEAH YOU CAN
YEAH TRIPLE R.
BANANA REMOTE
I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE TRIPLE R.
I THINK TRIPLE R. IS COOL
AND IT LOOKS COOL WHEN YOU PRINT IT IN FONT LOOKS PRETTY COOL
JUST LIKE THIS JUST AND YOU JUST PRINT TRIPLE R. IT LOOKS DOESN'T LOOK BAD IT'S SHORT IT'S OKAY
SO HAVE TO WRITE MY REPORT NOW I GUESS
UM
UM
YEAH SO WE HAVE EVERYTHING
WE HAVE THE PRODUCT WE HAVE THE COSTS WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF EVERYTHING
OKAY
I THINK IT'S ADJOURNED
RETIRE TO MY LAIR AND FINISH THE REPORT
THAT WAS A SHORT MEETING
BUT EFFICIENT THOUGH
PROBABLY
SEE
OKAY GOODBYE
COULD YOU GUYS DRAW ME A PICTURE OF THE FINAL DESIGN TO PUT ON THE COVER OF THE REPORT
UH WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHANGES DO WE
SO NO
IT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE AGREED UPON BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIED
UH S
FINAL DESIGN
BASICALLY IN WHAT WE DISCUSSED COVER AND BUTTONS WILL BE MADE OF RUBBER YELLOW COLOUR BLACK COMPONENTS AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT OVER HERE
WE CHOSE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF COLOUR FOR THE MENU
A BIT DARKER YELLOW SO THAT IT COM REALLY SHOWS IN THIS KEYPAD
IF YOU PUT THEM ALL BLACK IT'S NOT REALLY THAT GOOD A CONTRAST
SO
PROBAB YEAH
THAT'S THE BE
AND IT I GUESS IT'S MORE EASIER TO JUST PAINT IT ON THE RUBBER THAN TO UH
SO WE HAVE IT'S A BIT ROUND SHAPED THAT'S WHAT WE HAD UH
WE CHOSE THE BUTTONS TO BE UH TELETEXT OKAY BUTTON FAVOURITE CHANNEL AND THE MUTE
SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE CHOSE THERE
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD PLEASE INTERRUPT ME
OH
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
OH SORRY
I'D SAY THAT TOO
UH WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A EXTRA FUNCTION WITH THE SPEECH SAMPLE WHICH YOU CAN'T DO WITH A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL WHICH PEOPLE ALREADY DO
SO
WELL I'D I TEND TO DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE THE TREND ISSUE WAS A BIG ISSUE WHEN WE STARTED DESIGNING THIS
SO CAN'T WE JUST BASICALLY EXTEND IT TO THIRTEEN
OKAY
YEAH
WE DO
WE COULD TAKE OUT A CURVE INDEED
I THINK THE COLOUR IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REALLY THE CURVE BECAUSE IF YOU JUST END UP WITH AN ENTIRELY BLACK REMOTE CONTROL
SO BLACK AND GREY IS OKAY
WHICH WE CAN FABRICATE OKAY
NO WE BASICALLY
WE NEED TO STICK TO THAT
BUT THEY DON'T
WELL
AND IF WE
SO WHICH CURVE IS THAT BA THAT'S BASICALLY THAT CURVE
SO WE COULD U STILL HAVE THE COMFORT
I SECOND THAT
NO THAT IT WOULD TURN OUT TO BE A PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD REMOTE CONTROL
SO THAT'S NOT REALLY THAT
I WOULD
YEAH
I WOULD SAY I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THE COLOUR BECAUSE THAT'S AN EXTRA OPTION
AN EXTRA SERVICE WE CAN DELIVER FOR A LITTLE BIT OF MORE MONEY
SO WE CAN ALWAYS DO THAT
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT WE DISCUSSED
YES WE COULD HAVE
WELL I HOPE IT SELLS
WHICH ARE BASICALLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE MENU BUTTON
YEAH
WHICH IS NOT AN OPTION
TO MAKE IT THAT WAY YEAH
MM YEAH
AND IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD YOU HAVE A NAVIGATION NO KEYS TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE L. C. D. MENUS
SO
ONE I D NO ACTU
NO IT IT IS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD
YEAH
YEAH
WELL BASICALLY THE MENU OPTIONS INDEED
BUT
NO
YEAH
YEAH
TWO OR THREE
SO
YOU CAN SEVEN
OR WE COULD SAY IT
OR WE COULD SAY NEUTRAL WE 'CAUSE WE SCRATCHED THE
C
NO WE DON'T HAVE THE COLOUR
SO I
YES BUT THE END PRODUCT SO
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO WITH A TWO THEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT PERFECT BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT INITIALLY BUT WE
YEAH
OVERALL SCORE
TEN SIXTEEN
DIVIDED BY
IS TWO TWO THIRD
THERE'S
YEAH IF WE MAKE IT INTO A FOUR AS IN NEUTRAL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T IMPLEMENT IT
SO WE CAN'T SAY THAT WE THAT IT'S REALLY NOT WELL IMPLEMENTED
WE COME OUT ON A AVERAGE OF TWO ONE EIGHTH
SO WHICH IS PRETTY W GOOD
IT'S AT LEAST ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
SO WE COULD DEFINITELY HAVE DONE BETTER IF WE'VE HAD MORE RESOURCES BUT
YEAH
TRUE
SO DID YOU
YEAH
AND WE COULD SHARE INFORMATION WHICH WE RECEIVED
YEAH
ALTHOUGH FOR ACTUAL DESIGN I'D SAY THE RESPONSE TIME SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BECAUSE
THE DIGITAL PEN WAS DEFINITELY BETTER TO DRAW MY IDEAS AND TO
FURTHER ELABORATE ON THAT
SO
OH CAN YOU
OKAY
YEAH WELL IT COULD ALSO POSSIBLY BE WELL IS IT A MORE REAL TIME INFORMATION BASE SO WE CAN ALL SEE WHICH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO ONE ANOTHER
WELL I PERSONALLY DID NOT HAVE THAT BUT
THAT'S PROBABLY YOUR L DESCRIPTION
BUT I ALSO DIDN'T NOT REALLY
BUT STILL YOU HAD THAT AS WELL
IS THAT WE FINISHED UP THE DESIGN AND THEN WE CHECKED THE WEBSITE AND THEN THERE WAS JUST EXTRA INFORMATION
THERE WAS A LITTLE DELAY IN THE BIT OF A C
CRUCIAL DELAY
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE FOR THIS ANYWAY
YEAH
CHAMPAGNE
PRODUCT NAME
THE BANA 'CAUSE IT'S NOT YELLOW ANYMORE
WELL UH I WAS GOING FOR THE R. C. DELUXE BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A CATCHY NAME OR ANYTHING IT'S MORE
SOMETHING WITH OUR COMPANY NAME CAN WE DO ANYTHING WITH THAT
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE WEBSITE WHICH WILL HELP US OUT
THE REACTION DELUXE
IS THAT A NAME OR A C CAMPAIGN
YEAH
OR THE
THE REAL REACTOR
YOU SHOULD WRITE IT DOWN AS A AN OPTION
SO THAT'S ONE OPTION
SHOULD I WRITE THE BANANA DOWN OR
SURE
WELL I
UH DO YOU MEAN IT LIKE
YOU MEAN IT LIKE THIS
DASH C.
LIKE A C. RIGHT NOW OR A DASH IN A C.
IS IT TRIPLE R. C. S
NO
WELL THAT'S ANOTHER OPTION
OKAY SO WHICH ONES ARE WE GOING TO SCRATCH
DEFINITELY
I SAY THIS ONE AS WELL
TRIPLE R.
TRIPLE R. IT IS
YEAH SURE
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHETHER WE CAN SAVE IT AS A PICTURE OR NO
SURE
NETWORK PLACES
I WOULDN'T PICK THAT ONE NO
SURE
OH
I SEE YOU LATER
I THINK IT'S MORE OR LESS THE SAME AS WE HAD
NO MUCH S
NO NO NO NOT AT ALL
HMM
YEAH OF COURSE
THAT'S UH THE INTEGRATION STORY AGAIN
NO UH THIS IS JUST A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE SEE THERE
SO
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
HMM
I D
YEAH
HMM
HMM
HUH
OKAY BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM
IF WE TAKE ANOTHER COVER FOR INSTANCE BLACK THEN WE ALSO NEED ANOTHER BUTTON FRAME 'CAUSE BLACK AND BLACK DOESN'T WORK OBVIOUSLY
HUH
HUH
YEAH
HMM
HMM
RIGHT
I AGREE
MM-HMM
OR SAY LET'S LOSE RUBBER TAKE PLASTIC
YES
ALTHOUGH WE ARE DEMOLISHING A LITTLE BIT THE STYLE
BUT
YEAH
CAN WE THEN NOT ALSO UH CHANGE THE MATERIAL
WE TAKE PLASTIC FOR THE BASIC COVER AND
WE CAN PUT THOSE TO THE TO THE OTHER COVERS
THAT'S TRUE
BUT OKAY
BUT WHAT DO YOU THEN SUGGEST WE'D LOSE
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOSE TWO THINGS AND I GUESS
YES
OKAY AND THAT'S ENOUGH
HMM
HMM
PERHAPS WE SHOULD MAKE M
HUH
PERHAPS WE SHOULD MAKE CLEAR TO OUR CUSTOMER THAT WE HAD TO DO THIS TO STAY UNDER THE COST
AND THAT'S UH THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS AN OPTION AND THAT WE HAD TO DROP THE OPTION TO STAY UNDER THE COST THAT THEY KNOW THAT
PERHAPS THEY DECIDE THA
OF COURSE
PERHAPS THEY UH NO BUT PERHAPS THEY THINK UH OKAY THE COVER IS SUCH A NICE IDEA
UH LET'S THAT THAT THEN THEY UH THAT ALLOW US TO MAKE SOME MORE COSTS
WE CA WE UH WE CAN AT LEAST TELL THEM THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
HUH
NO I'M NOT UH TALKING ABOUT THAT COST BUT THE ONE THAT G HAS GIVEN US THE ORDER TO DESIGN THIS
WE COULD AT LEAST M UH MAKE IT LIKE THIS LIKE YOU SAID AND THEN TELL THEM OKAY
WE HAD TO DROP THIS AND THAT JUST THAT YOU KNOW
IT IS AN STILL AN OPTION BUT NOT FOR THIS PRICE
EXACTLY BUT
HMM
I'D SAY LOSE THE CURVE AND THE COLOUR AND
HMM
HMM
HMM
OH
I AGREE
NO
HMM
YES
HUH
HMM
ME TOO I FELT A BIT BLIND THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING I HAD NO LIST OF AVAILABLE MATERIALS
AND THEN I D HAD NOT LIST OF AVAILABLE C FINANCES
SO
HMM
HMM
HMM
ONE
HMM
MANUAL
I THINK THE L. C. D. DISPLAY COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT THEN A NORMAL REMOTE CONTROL BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
SO
YEAH I TH
EXACTLY
NO THAT'S TRUE
I THINK IT WON'T BE A BIG PROBLEM
AH
UM
WITH THE MORE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS ON
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
THE MENUS UH
THINGS LIKE BRIGHTNESS AND UH THOSE KIND OF THINGS WE'VE PUT IN THE MENU BECAUSE WE HAVE NO BUTTONS FOR THOSE
YES
MM
YES
NAH IT'S NOT REALLY ONLY AN EXTRA
NO MENUS
THINK ABOUT
HMM
BUT
M
CHANGING COVERS IS ALSO TREND THAT WE FOLLOWED
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM
SIX
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
MM-HMM
HMM OF COURSE
MM-HMM
BUT I THINK FOR THIS PRICE THIS IS IT'S REALLY A REASONABLE PRODUCT
IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT
OH
OH
YEAH
BUT IF PEP PEOPLE REALLY WANT SPEECH RECOGNITION THEN THEY MUST BE PREPARED TO PU TO PAY MORE BECAUSE IT'S CANNOT BE DONE FOR THIS
HMM YEAH
AH BUT FOR THIS PRICE UH YOU CANNOT ASK THAT
YOU CANNOT TH THINK OF THAT
NO IT'S NOT
MM-HMM
OH IT'S ALSO MORE ATTRACTIVE
HMM
YES
HMM
HMM
YEAH
HUH
HMM
HMM
HMM
THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT I HAD IN THE BEGINNING
EVERYBODY WAS USING MATERIALS THAT S I DIDN'T HAVE
SO
OH
HMM
HMM
HMM
MM-HMM
BUT THERE'S UH ALSO ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS I NOTICED
UH YOU HAVE TO FINISH A PAGE BEFORE GOING TO A N
OH
OKAY I SAW THAT UH
HMM
YEAH BUT I MADE
OKAY BUT I MADE THREE PAGES AND THEY WERE NOT FINISHED
AND WHEN THE THIRD ONE WAS FINISHED I WANTED TO DOWNLOAD IT AND THEN IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE ANYMORE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO CLOSE ALL THE PINNITS UH THE PAGES BEFORE GOING FURTHER
EXACTLY
SO WE CANNOT WORK ON MORE THAN ONE PAGE AT SAME TIME
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE
YOU HAVE TO FINISH IT COMPLETELY THEN DOWNLOAD IT IT'S THEN START A NEW ONE
THAT'S NOT VERY UH HANDY BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT THEN IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
HMM
MM-HMM
AH
WELL
HMM
HUH
YEAH
YEAH
MM
HMM
HMM
HMM
HMM
NO
OKAY BRING OUT THE BEER
I HAVE NO MORE EMAIL
MY COACH IS UH BEING VERY SILENT NOW
NO WE HAVEN'T THINK ABOVE ABOUT THAT
HUH
IT'S BETTER THAN THI I THINK THAN A SERIAL NUMBER
SONY UH T. R. SOMETHING UH F MEANS NOTHING TO ME
UH
LIKE FRUIT NAMES
UH AT LEAST IT'S NOT SOMETHING WITH NUMBERS
NUMBERS ARE SO MEANINGLESS TO THE PEOPLE
I MEAN
REAL REACTION
REAL REACT
THE REAL REACTOR I DON'T FIND THAT UH THAT BAD AT ALL
YEAH
BECAUSE OUR NAME IS REAL REACTION
I'M LOOKING FOR THINGS IN THE NAME
SO THAT THE FIRST THREE LETTERS ARE S THE SAME
R. E. A. R. E. A.
THE TRIPLE R.
REAL REACTION REMOTES CONTROL
TRIPLE R.
YEAH
YEAH THAT
I THINK
TRIPLE R.
DOESN'T SOUND
YEAH
AH
I THINK I LIKE IT LIKE THIS MORE
HMM
MM
I WOULD HUH
I WOULD LOSE THE C. AND JUST NAME IT TRIPLE R.
IT SOUNDS LIKE UH THINKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND COMBINING IT
I WOULD JUST SAY TRIPLE R. S TRIPLE R.
THAT'S ALSO SHORT CATCHY
BANANA
